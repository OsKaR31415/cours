# Github copilot make coding assignments futile

## What copilot can do
 - generate code solutions from comments or simply function name
     - even complex codes like [[algorithme de Dijkstra|Dijkstra's algorithm]], [[quicksort]]...
 - Randomize code so every solution is not the same

## What solutions are possible
 - ~~Change programming language~~ : copilot knows even functionnal languages (everything that is on github)
     - teach in programming languages that don't exist
 - Make exams on paper on pen
 - Ask students to explain their code

## What it means for assignments
 - Giving simple assignments will be useless **unless you require an explanation of the code**
 - Students will focus on more complex codes
 - Students will get _Repetitive Stress Injuries_ to the pinkies for pressing the `Tab` Key
