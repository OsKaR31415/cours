Introduction complète à [[LISP#common lisp]]

# Abstract
> Lisp is often thought of as an academic language, but it need not be. This is the first book that introduces Lisp as a language for the real world.
> 
> _Practical Common Lisp_ presents a thorough introduction to Common Lisp, providing you with an overall understanding of the language features and how they work. Over a third of the book is devoted to practical examples, such as the core of a spam filter and a web application for browsing MP3s and streaming them via the Shoutcast protocol to any standard MP3 client software (e.g., iTunes, XMMS, or WinAmp). In other "practical" chapters, author **Peter Seibel** demonstrates how to build a simple but flexible in-memory database, how to parse binary files, and how to build a unit test framework in 26 lines of code.
