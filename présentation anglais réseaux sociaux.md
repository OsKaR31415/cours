# Problems of social networks

 - suggestion algorithms
     - influence the way we think
         - put yourself in an "information bubble"
             - reinforcement of your current state of mind
             - never let you face opposed ideas
     - can be controlled by the owners of the app
         - like TikTok could try to influence people
             - especially in the advantage of China
     - encourage hate messages
         - because they induce more engagement
     - mental health problems
         - some people put too much importance in some virtual stuff
             - likes, followers...
         - promotion of idols of beauty etc. that are non-realistic

# Solutions

 - stop using social networks
     - very radical, but very efficient
 - try to make them less addictive
     - disable notifications (keep only important ones, like direct messages)
     - no-colors mode (black and white is less addictive)
     - set yourself some time limits
         - maximum time per day
         - no screens before sleeping
         - never refuse to do somthing because of social media
 - go touch the grass (at least once a month)
     - you can also take showers, unlike League Of Legends players
