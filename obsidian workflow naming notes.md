Ease to remember and length sometimes go together, sometimes are opposed. The right thing to do is to find the "sweet spot" where the file name describes enough but isn't to long.

To make notes easy to **find**, we have to keep a structure for every note

> [!definition] Structure of notes titles
>  - For concepts with well-defined name, be precise in the name
>      - Example: `[[fonction arg sinus hyperbolique]]`, not `[[argsh]]`
>      - **But:** use [[obsidian aliases]] to these shorter names
>  - For sources (citations, attachments...), be precise
>      - makes them easier to find back
>  - For _hierarchical_ names, put the main theme at the beginning of the name
>      - Example: `[[obsidian plugin tasks]]`, not `[[tasks plugin obsidian]]`
>      - That allows to quicksearch the beginnning to have everything on a theme
>          - searching `obsidian` will give notes about obsidian, `obsidian plugin` will reduce it to notes about obsidian plugins
