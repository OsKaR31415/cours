**Note:** I'm not currently using this, as I don't need to keep track of what I have been doing in a specific lesson. But the model could possibly be replicated for other things than lessons.

These are basically a specific type of [[Map of content]], that don't list notes about a subject, but rather notes with a similar context (like a specific lesson).


> [!important] goals
>  - keep track of what is done during a lesson
>  - make a bridge between notes
>      - daily notes -> cours -> concept
>      - subjects -> cours -> concept


> [!definition] implementation
>  - marked with `#cours`
>  - link to the subject of the course via `up::`
>  - could be linked in a daily note
>      - So it can be found from the date of the lesson
>      - So you can see when you have to revise what
