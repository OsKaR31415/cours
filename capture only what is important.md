---

 - **do not** capture _everything interesting
     - but how to select what to choose ?

# what to capture ?
 - capture what is **important**
     - really only things that _stand out_
 - what **_will_ be usefull**
     - you have to know what you _want_
     - select information according to your aim
 - capture _original things_
     - things that you have not seen elsewhere
