# Textual MOCs
 - For **small** MOCs
     - Simply use The [[dataview MOC query]]
 - For big MOCs
     - Build sections by big themes, make nested lists
     - use the dataview queries to make sure everything is here
         - Put dataview queries for each section

# Drawed MOCs
Not implemented yet

> [!note] Ideas
