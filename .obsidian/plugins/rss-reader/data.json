It’s an old and oft-debated question in philosophy. And it now turns out to also be a question that rises to prominence in connection with the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/\">concept of the ruliad</a> that’s emerged from our <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wolfram Physics Project</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve wondered about alien minds for a long time—and tried all sorts of ways to imagine what it might be like to see things from their point of view. But in the past I’ve never really had a way to build my intuition about it. That is, until now. So, what’s changed? It’s AI. Because in AI we finally have an accessible form of alien mind.<span id=\"more-52580\"></span></p>\n<p>We typically go to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">a lot of trouble to train</a> our AIs to produce results that are like we humans would do. But what if we take a human-aligned AI, and modify it? Well, then we get something that’s in effect an alien AI—an AI aligned not with us humans, but with an alien mind.</p>\n<p>So how can we see what such an alien AI—or alien mind—is “thinking”? A convenient way is to try to capture its “mental imagery”: the image it forms in its “mind’s eye”. Let’s say we use a typical <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageSynthesize.html\">generative AI</a> to go from a description in human language—like “a cat in a party hat”—to a generated image:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323img2.png' alt='' title='' width='149' height='149'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s exactly the kind of image we’d expect—which isn’t surprising, because it <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/Stable-Diffusion-V1/\">comes from a generative AI</a> that’s trained to “do as we would”. But now let’s imagine taking the neural net that implements this generative AI, and modifying its insides—say by resetting <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#neural-nets\">weights that appear in its neural net</a>.</p>\n<p>By doing this we’re in effect going from a human-aligned neural net to some kind of “alien” one. But this “alien” neural net will still produce some kind of image—because that’s what a neural net like this does. But what will the image be? Well, in effect, it’s showing us the mental imagery of the “alien mind” associated with the modified neural net. </p>\n<p>But what does it actually look like? Well, here’s a sequence obtained by progressively modifying the neural net—in effect making it “progressively more alien”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec1img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec1img3.png' alt='' title='' width='612' height='201'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At the beginning it’s still a very recognizable picture of “a cat in a party hat”. But it soon becomes more and more alien: the mental image in effect diverges further from the human one—until it no longer “looks like a cat”, and in the end looks, at least to us, rather random. </p>\n<p>There are many details of how this works that we’ll be discussing below. But what’s important is that—by studying the effects of changing the neural net—we now have a systematic “experimental” platform for probing at least one kind of “alien mind”. We can think of what we’re doing as a kind of “artificial neuroscience”, probing not actual human brains, but neural net analogs of them.</p>\n<p>And we’ll see many parallels to neuroscience experiments. For example, we’ll often be “knocking out” particular parts of our “neural net brain”, a little like how injuries such as strokes can knock out parts of a human brain. But we know that when a human brain suffers a stroke, this can lead to phenomena like “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispatial_neglect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hemispatial neglect</a>”, in which a stroke victim asked to draw a clock will end up drawing just one side of the clock—a little like the pictures of cats “degrade” when parts of the “neural net brain” are knocked out. </p>\n<p>Of course, there are many differences between real brains and artificial neural nets. But most of the core phenomena we’ll observe here seem robust and fundamental enough that we can expect them to span very different kinds of “brains”—human, artificial and alien. And the result is that we can begin to build up intuition about what the worlds of different—and alien—minds can be like. </p>\n<h2 id=\"generating-images-with-ais\">Generating Images with AIs</h2>\n<p>How does an AI manage to create a picture, say of a cat in a party hat? Well, the AI has to be trained on “what makes a reasonable picture”—and how to determine what a picture is of. Then in some sense what the AI does is to start generating “reasonable” pictures at random, in effect continually checking what the picture it’s generating seems to be “of”, and tweaking it to guide it towards being a picture of what one wants.</p>\n<p>So what counts as a “reasonable picture”? If one looks at billions of pictures—say on the web—there are lots of regularities. For example, the pixels aren’t random; nearby ones are usually highly correlated. If there’s a face, it’s usually more or less symmetrical. It’s more common to have blue at the top of a picture, and green at the bottom. And so on. And the important technological point is that it turns out to be possible to use a neural network to capture regularities in images, and to generate random images that exhibit them.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of “random images” generated in this way:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img1.jpg' alt='' title='' width='624' height='834'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And the idea is that these images—while each is “random” in its specifics—will in general follow the “statistics” of the billions of images from the web on which the neural network has been “trained”. We’ll be talking more about images like these later. But for now suffice it to say that while some may just look like abstract patterns, others seem to contain things like landscapes, human forms, etc. And what’s notable is that none just look like “random arrays of pixels”; they all show some kind of “structure”. And, yes, given that they’ve been trained from pictures on the web, it’s not too surprising that the “structure” sometimes includes things like human forms. </p>\n<p>But, OK, let’s say we specifically want a picture of a cat in a party hat. From all of the almost infinitely large number of possible “well-structured” random images we might generate, how do we get one that’s of a cat in a party hat? Well, a first question is: how would we know if we’ve succeeded? As humans, we could just look and see what our image is of. But it turns out we can also <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageIdentify.html\">train a neural net to do this</a> (and, no, it <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/\">doesn&#8217;t always get it exactly right</a>):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec2rowexportimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img3.png' alt='' title='' width='610' height='108'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>How is the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NetTrain.html\">neural net trained</a>? The basic idea is to take billions of images—say from the web—for which corresponding captions have been provided. Then one progressively tweaks the parameters of the neural net to make it reproduce these captions when it’s fed the corresponding images. But the critical point is the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#neural-nets\">neural net turns out to do more</a>: it also successfully produces “reasonable” captions for images it’s never seen before. What does “reasonable” mean? Operationally, it means captions that are similar to what we humans might assign. And, yes, it’s far from obvious that a computationally constructed neural net will behave at all like us humans, and the fact that it does <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">is presumably telling us</a> fundamental things about how human brains work.</p>\n<p>But for now what’s important is that we can use this captioning capability to progressively guide images we produce towards what we want. Start from “pure randomness”. Then try to “structure the randomness” to make a “reasonable” picture, but at every step see in effect “what the caption would be”. And try to “go in a direction” that “leads towards” a picture with the caption we want. Or, in other words, progressively try to get to a picture that’s of what we want. </p>\n<p>The way this is set up in practice, one starts from an array of random pixels, then iteratively forms the picture one wants:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img5.jpg' alt='' title='' width='612' height='196'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Different initial arrays lead to different final pictures—though if everything works correctly, the final pictures will all be of “what one asked for”, in this case a cat in a party hat (and, yes, there are a few “glitches”):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623Sec2catshatsimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec2img6.png' alt='' title='' width='618' height='198'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We don’t know how mental images are formed in human brains. But it seems conceivable that the process is not too different. And that in effect as we’re trying to “conjure up a reasonable image”, we’re continually checking if it’s aligned with what we want—so that, for example, if our checking process is impaired we can end up with a different image, as in hemispatial neglect. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-notion-of-interconcept-space\">The Notion of Interconcept Space</h2>\n<p>That everything can ultimately be represented in terms of digital data is foundational to the whole computational paradigm. But the effectiveness of neural nets relies on the slightly different idea that it’s useful to treat at least many kinds of things as being characterized by arrays of real numbers. In the end one might extract from a neural net that’s giving captions to images the word “cat”. But inside the neural net it’ll operate with arrays of numbers that correspond in some fairly abstract way to the image you’ve given, and the textual caption it’ll finally produce.</p>\n<p>And in general neural nets can typically be thought of as associating “feature vectors” with things—whether those things are images, text, or anything else. But whereas words like “cat” and “dog” are discrete, the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#the-concept-of-embeddings\">feature vectors associated with them</a> just contain collections of real numbers. And this means that we can think of a whole space of possibilities, with “cat” and “dog” just corresponding to two specific points. </p>\n<p>So what’s out there in that space of possibilities? For the feature vectors we typically deal with in practice <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/CLIP-Multi-domain-Feature-Extractor/\">the space is many-thousand-dimensional</a>. But we can for example look at the (nominally straight) line from the “dog point” to the “cat point” in this space, and even generate sample images of what comes between:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg1.png' alt='' title='' width='609' height='196'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, if we want to, we can keep going “beyond cat”—and pretty soon things start becoming quite weird:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3catmorphimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg2.png' alt='' title='' width='610' height='196'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We can also do things like look at the line from a plane to a cat—and, yes, there’s strange stuff in there (wings <img title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123rightarrow.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\" \" /> hat <img title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123rightarrow.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\" \" /> ears?):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec3Aimg3.png' alt='' title='' width='619' height='199'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>What about elsewhere? For example, what happens “around” our standard “cat in a party hat”? With the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/CLIP-Multi-domain-Feature-Extractor/\">particular setup we&#8217;re using</a>, there’s a 2304-dimensional space of possibilities. But as an example, we look at what we get on a particular 2D plane through the “standard cat” point:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img1A.jpeg' alt='' title='' width='621' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Our “standard cat” is in the middle. But as we move away from the “standard cat” point, progressively weirder things happen. For a while there are recognizable (if perhaps demonic) cats to be seen. But soon there isn’t much “catness” in evidence—though sometimes hats do remain (in what we might characterize as an “all hat, no cat” situation, reminiscent of the Texan “all hat, no cattle”). </p>\n<p>How about if we pick other planes through the standard cat point? All sorts of images appear:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" style=\"margin-right: 5px \"alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img3.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img3A.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img4.png\"><img  alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img4A.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" style=\"margin-right: 5px\"  alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img5.png\"><img style=\"margin-top: 5px\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img5A.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img6.png\"><img style=\"margin-top: 5px\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3-45img6B.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>But the fundamental story is always the same: there’s a kind of “cat island”, beyond which there are weird and only vaguely cat-related images—encircled by an “ocean” of what seem like purely abstract patterns with no obvious cat connection. And in general the picture that emerges is that in the immense space of possible “statistically reasonable” images, there are islands dotted around that correspond to “<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-concept-of-concepts\">linguistically describable concepts</a>”—like cats in party hats. </p>\n<p>The islands normally seem to be roughly “spherical”, in the sense that they extend about the same nominal distance in every direction. But relative to the whole space, each island is absolutely tiny—something like perhaps a fraction 2<sup>–2000</sup> &#8776; 10<sup>–600</sup> of the volume of the whole space. And between these islands there lie huge expanses of what we might call “interconcept space”. </p>\n<p>What’s out there in interconcept space? It’s full of images that are “statistically reasonable” based on the images we humans have put on the web, etc.—but aren’t of things we humans have come up with words for. It’s as if in developing our civilization—and our human language—we’ve “colonized” only certain small islands in the space of all possible concepts, leaving vast amounts of interconcept space unexplored. </p>\n<p>What’s out there is pretty weird—and sometimes a bit disturbing. Here’s what we see zooming in on the same (randomly chosen) plane around “cat island” as above:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3catgridimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg1B.jpg' alt='' title='' width='617' height='620'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" style=\"margin-right: 5px \"alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg3.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg3.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg4.png\"><img  alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg4.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" style=\"margin-right: 5px\"  alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg5.png\"><img style=\"margin-top: 5px\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg5.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n<td><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg6.png\"><img style=\"margin-top: 5px\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Yimg6.png\" width=\"305\" height=\"\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>What are all these things? In a sense, words fail us. They’re things on the shores of interconcept space, where human experience has not (yet) taken us, and for which human language has not been developed.</p>\n<p>What if we venture further out into interconcept space—and for example just sample points in the space at random? It’s just like we already saw above: we’ll get images that are somehow “statistically typical” of what we humans have put on the web, etc., and on which our AI was trained. Here are a few more examples:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Zimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec3Zimg1.jpg' alt='' title='' width='620' height='828'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, we can pick out at least two basic classes of images: ones that seem like “pure abstract textures”, and ones that seem “representational”, and remind us of real-world scenes from human experience. There are intermediate cases—like “textures” with structures that seem like they might “represent something”, and “representational-seeming” images where we just can’t place what they might be representing.</p>\n<p>But when we do see recognizable “real-world-inspired” images they’re a curious reflection of the concepts—and general imagery—that we humans find “interesting enough to put on the web”. We’re not dealing here with some kind of “arbitrary interconcept space”; we’re dealing with “human-aligned” interconcept space that’s in a sense anchored to human concepts, but extends between and around them. And, yes, viewed in these terms it becomes quite unsurprising that in the interconcept space we’re sampling, there are so many images that remind us of human forms and common human situations. </p>\n<p>But just what were the images that the AI saw, from which it formed this model of interconcept space? There were a <a href=\"https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">few billion of them, &#8220;foraged&#8221; from the web</a>. Like things on the web in general, it’s a motley collection; here’s a random sample:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071523sec3photogridimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071523sec3photogridimg1.jpg' alt='' title='' width='620' height='394'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Some can be thought of as capturing aspects of “life as it is”, but many are more aspirational, coming from staged and often promotionally oriented photography. And, yes, there are lots of Net-a-Porter-style “clothing-without-heads” images. There are also lots of images of “things”—like food, etc. But somehow when we sample randomly in interconcept space it’s the human forms that most distinctively stand out, conceivably because “things” are not particularly consistent in their structure, but human forms always have a certain consistency of “head-body-arms, etc.” structure.</p>\n<p>It’s notable, though, that even the most real-world-like images we find by randomly sampling interconcept space seem to typically be “painterly” and “artistic” rather than “photorealistic” and “photographic”. It’s a different story close to “concept points”—like on cat island. There more photographic forms are common, though as we go away from the “actual concept point”, there’s a tendency towards either a rather toy-like appearance, or something more like an illustration.</p>\n<p>By the way, even the most “photographic” images the AI generates won’t be anything that comes directly from the training set. Because—as we’ll discuss later—the AI is not set up to directly store images; instead its training process in effect “grinds up” images to extract their “statistical properties”. And while “statistical features” of the original images will show up in what the AI generates, any detailed arrangement of pixels in them is overwhelmingly unlikely to do so.</p>\n<p>But, OK, what happens if we start not at a “describable concept” (like “a cat in a party hat”), but just at a random point in interconcept space?

And occasionally there’ll be a “flash” of something “representationally familiar” (perhaps like a human form) that’ll show up. But most of the time we won’t be able to say “what these images are of”. They’re of things that are somehow “statistically” like what we’ve seen, but they’re not things that are familiar enough that we’ve—at least so far—developed a way to describe them, say with words.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-images-of-interconcept-space\">The Images of Interconcept Space</h2>\n<p>There’s something strangely familiar—yet unfamiliar—to many of the images in interconcept space.

Many have a certain artistic quality to them—and a feeling that they are some kind of “mindful interpretation” of a perhaps mundane thing in the world, or a simple, essentially mathematical pattern. And to some extent the “mind” involved is a collective version of our human one, reflected in a neural net that has “experienced” some of the many images humans have put on the web, etc. But in some ways the mind is also a more alien one, formed from the computational structure of the neural net, with its particular features, and no doubt in some ways <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/\">computationally irreducible</a> behavior.</p>\n<p>And indeed there are some motifs that show up repeatedly that are presumably reflections of features of the underlying structure of the neural net. The “granulated” appearance, with alternation between light and dark, for example, is presumably a consequence of the dynamics of the convolutional parts of the neural net—and analogous to the results of what amounts to iterated blurring and sharpening with a certain effective pixel scale (reminiscent, for example, of video feedback):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img15_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec4img15.jpg' alt='' title='' width='609' height='236'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"making-minds-alien\">Making Minds Alien</h2>\n<p>We can think of what we’ve done so far as exploring what a mind trained from human-like experiences can “imagine” by generalizing from those experiences. But what might a different kind of mind imagine?</p>\n<p>As a very rough approximation, we can think of just taking the trained “mind” we’ve created, and explicitly modifying it, then seeing what it now “imagines”. Or, more specifically, we can take the neural net we have been using, and start making changes to it, and seeing what effect that has on the images it produces.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss later the details of how the network is set up, but suffice it to say here that it <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/Stable-Diffusion-V1/\">involves 391 distinct internal modules</a>, involving altogether nearly a billion numerical weights. When the network is trained, those numerical weights are carefully tuned to achieve the results we want. But what if we just change them? We’ll still (normally) get a network that can generate images. But in some sense it’ll be “thinking differently”—so potentially the images will be different. </p>\n<p>So as a very coarse first experiment—reminiscent of many that are done in biology—let’s just “knock out” each successive module in turn, setting all its weights to zero. If we ask the resulting network to generate a picture of “a cat in a party hat”, here’s what we now get:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec5Aimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071223sec5Aimg1B.jpg' alt='' title='' width='610' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Let’s look at these results in a bit more detail.

Here are some randomly chosen examples of what happens if one zeros out successively more modules (one might call this a “HAL experiment” in remembrance of the fate of the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/learning-about-the-future-from-2001-a-space-odyssey-fifty-years-later/\">fictional HAL AI in the movie <em>2001</a></em>):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5KBimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5KBimg1.jpg' alt='' title='' width='617' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And basically once the “catness” of the images is lost, things become more and more alien from there on out, ending either in apparent randomness, or sometimes barren “zeroness”.</p>\n<p>Rather than zeroing out modules, we can instead <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NetInitialize.html\">randomize the weights</a> in them (perhaps a bit like the effect of a tumor rather than a stroke in a brain)—but the results are usually at least qualitatively similar:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071623sec5rowgrid2img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec5KBimg2A.jpg' alt='' title='' width='618' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Something else we can do is just to progressively mix randomness uniformly into every weight in the network (perhaps a bit like globally “drugging” a brain).

But how does this fit into a more general picture of alien minds and what they might be like?</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/\">concept of the ruliad</a> we finally have a principled way to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad\">talk about alien minds</a>—at least at a theoretical level. And the key point is that any alien mind—or, for that matter, any mind—can be thought of as “observing” or sampling the ruliad from its own particular point of view, or in effect, its own position in rulial space.</p>\n<p>The ruliad is defined to be the entangled limit of all possible computations: a unique object with an inevitable structure. And the idea is that anything—whether one interprets it as a phenomenon or an observer—must be part of the ruliad. The key to our <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Physics Project</a> is then that “observers like us” have <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/\">certain general characteristics</a>. We are computationally bounded, with “finite minds” and limited sensory input. And we have a certain coherence that comes from our belief in our persistence in time, and our consistent thread of experience. And what we then discover in our Physics Project is the rather remarkable result that from these characteristics and the general properties of the ruliad alone it’s essentially inevitable that we must perceive the universe to exhibit the fundamental physical laws it does, in particular the three big theories of twentieth-century physics: general relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. </p>\n<p>But what about more detailed aspects of what we perceive? Well, that will depend on more detailed aspects of us as observers, and of how our minds are set up. And in a sense, each different possible mind can be thought of as existing in a certain place in rulial space. Different human minds are mostly close in rulial space, animal minds further away, and more alien minds still further. But how can we characterize what these minds are “thinking about”, or how these minds “perceive things”?</p>\n<p>From inside our own minds we can form a sense of what we perceive. But we don’t really have good ways to reliably probe what another mind perceives. But what about what another mind imagines? Well, that’s where what we’ve been doing here comes in. Because with generative AI we’ve got a mechanism for exposing the “mental imagery” of an “AI mind”. </p>\n<p>We could consider doing this with words and text, say with an LLM. But for us humans images have a certain fluidity that text does not. Our eyes and brains can perfectly well “see” and absorb images even if we don’t “understand” them. But it’s very difficult for us to absorb text that we don’t “understand”; it usually tends to seem just like a kind of “word soup”. </p>\n<p>But, OK, so we generate “mental imagery” from “minds” that have been “made alien” by various modifications. How come we humans can understand anything such minds make? Well, it’s bit like one person being able to understand the thoughts of another. Their brains—and minds—are built differently. And their “internal view” of things will inevitably be different. But the crucial idea—that’s for example central to language—is that it’s possible to “package up” thoughts into something that can be “transported” to another mind. Whatever some particular internal thought might be, by the time we can express it with words in a language, it’s possible to communicate it to another mind that will “unpack” it into different internal thoughts.</p>\n<p>It’s a nontrivial fact of physics that <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/\">&#8220;pure motion&#8221; in physical space is possible</a>; in other words, that an “object” can be moved “without change” from one place in physical space to another. And now, in a sense, we’re asking about <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space\">pure motion in rulial space</a>: can we move something “without change” from one mind at one place in rulial space to another mind at another place? In physical space, things like particles—as well as things like black holes—are the fundamental elements that are imagined to move without change. So what’s now the analog in rulial space? It seems to be concepts—as often, for example, represented by words. </p>\n<p>So what does that mean for our exploration of generative AI “alien minds”? We can ask whether when we move from one potentially alien mind to another concepts are preserved. We don’t have a perfect proxy for this (though we could make a better one by appropriately training neural net classifiers). But as a first approximation this is like asking whether as we “change the mind”—or move in rulial space—we can still recognize the “concept” the mind produces. Or, in other words, if we start with a “mind” that’s generating a cat in a party hat, will we still recognize the concepts of cat or hat in what a “modified mind” produces? </p>\n<p>And what we’ve seen is that sometimes we do, and sometimes we don’t. And for example when we looked at “cat island” we saw a certain boundary beyond which we could no longer recognize “catness” in the image that was produced. And by studying things like cat island (and particularly its analogs when not just the “prompt” but also the underlying neural net is changed) it should be possible to map out how far concepts “extend” across alien minds.</p>\n<p>It’s also possible to think about a kind of inverse question: just what is the <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extent of a mind in rulial space</a>? Or, in other words, what range of points of view, ultimately about the ruliad, can it hold? Will it be “narrow-minded”, able to think only in particular ways, with particular concepts? Or will it be more “broad-minded”, encompassing more ways of thinking, with more concepts?</p>\n<p>In a sense the whole arc of the intellectual development of our civilization can be thought of as corresponding to an expansion in rulial space: with us progressively being able to think in new ways, and about new things. And as we expand in rulial space, we are in effect encompassing more of what we previously would have had to consider the domain of an alien mind.</p>\n<p>When we look at images produced by generative AI away from the specifics of human experience—say in interconcept space, or with modified rules of generation—we may at first be able to make little from them. Like inkblots or arrangements of stars we’ll often find ourselves wanting to say that what we see looks like this or that thing we know.</p>\n<p>But the real question is whether we can devise some way of describing what we see that allows us to build thoughts on what we see, or “reason” about it. And what’s very typical is that we manage to do this when we come up with a general “symbolic description” of what we see, say captured with words in natural language (or, now, <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/\">computational language</a>). Before we have those words, or that symbolic description, we’ll tend just not to absorb what we see.</p>\n<p>And so, for example, even though <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p187--substitution-systems-and-fractals/\">nested patterns</a> have always existed in nature, and were even explicitly <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/#lessons-from-the-past\">created by mosaic artisans in the early 1200s</a>, they seem to have never been systematically noticed or discussed at all until the latter part of the 20th century, when finally the framework of “fractals” was developed for talking about them. </p>\n<p>And so it may be with many of the forms we’ve seen here. As of today, we have no name for them, no systematic framework for thinking about them, and no reason to view them as important. But particularly if the things we do repeatedly show us such forms, we’ll eventually come up with names for them, and start incorporating them into the domain that our minds cover. </p>\n<p>And in a sense what we’ve done here can be thought of as showing us a preview of what’s out there in rulial space, in what’s currently the domain of alien minds. In the general exploration of <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/ruliology/\">ruliology</a>, and the investigation of what arbitrary simple programs in the computational universe do, we’re able to jump far across the ruliad. But it’s typical that what we see is not something we can connect to things we’re familiar with. In what we’re doing here, we’re moving only much smaller distances in rulial space. We’re starting from generative AI that’s closely aligned with current human development—having been trained from images that we humans have put on the web, etc. But then we’re making small changes to our “AI mind”, and looking at what it now generates. </p>\n<p>What we see is often surprising. But it’s still close enough to where we “currently are” in rulial space that we can—at least to some extent—absorb and reason about what we’re seeing. Still, the images often don’t “make sense” to us. And, yes, quite possibly the AI has invented something that has a rich and “meaningful” inner structure. But it’s just that we don’t (yet) have a way to talk about it—and if we did, it would immediately “make perfect sense” to us. </p>\n<p>So if we see something we don’t understand, can we just “train a translator”? At some level the answer must be yes. Because the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/\">Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies that ultimately there’s a fundamental uniformity to the ruliad. But the problem is that the translator is likely to have to do an <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/\">irreducible amount of computational work</a>. And so it won’t be implementable by a “mind like ours”. Still, even though we can’t create a “general translator” we can expect that certain features of what we see will still be translatable—in effect by exploiting certain pockets of computational reducibility that must necessarily exist even when the system as a whole is full of computational irreducibility. And operationally what this means in our case is that the AI may in effect have found certain regularities or patterns that we don’t happen to have noticed but that are useful in exploring further from the “current human point” in rulial space.</p>\n<p>It’s very challenging to get an intuitive understanding of what rulial space is like. But the approach we’ve taken here is for me a promising first effort in “humanizing” rulial space, and seeing just how we might be able to relate to what is so far the domain of alien minds. </p>\n<hr style=\"border-width: 2px;margin-bottom: 2rem;\">\n<h2 id=\"appendix-how-does-the-generative-ai-work?\">Appendix: How Does the Generative AI Work?</h2>\n<p>In the main part of this piece, we’ve mostly just talked about what generative AI does, not how it works inside. Here I’ll go a little deeper into what’s inside the particular type of generative AI system that I’ve used in my explorations. It’s a <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/Stable-Diffusion-V1/\">method called stable diffusion</a>, and its operation is in many ways both clever and surprising. As it’s implemented today it’s steeped in fairly complicated engineering details. To what extent these will ultimately be necessary isn’t clear. But in any case here I’ll mostly concentrate on general principles, and on giving a broad outline of how generative AI can be used to produce images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-distribution-of-typical-images\">The Distribution of Typical Images</h3>\n<p>At the core of generative AI is the ability to produce things of some particular type that “follow the patterns of” known things of that type. So, for example, <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">large language models (LLMs)</a> are intended to produce text that “follows the patterns” of text written by humans, say on the web. And generative AI systems for images are similarly intended to produce images that “follow the patterns” of images put on the web, etc. </p>\n<p>But what kinds of patterns exist in typical images, say on the web? Here are some examples of “typical images”—scaled down to 32×32 pixels and taken from a <a href=\"https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/CIFAR-100/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">standard set of 60,000 images</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img1.png' alt='' title='' width='642' height='155'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And as a very first thing, we can ask what colors show up in these images. They’re not uniform in RGB space: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img2.png' alt='' title='' width='192' height='72'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what about the positions of different colors? Adjusting to accentuate color differences, the “average image” turns out to have a curious “HAL’s eye” look (presumably with blue for sky at the top, and brown for earth at the bottom): </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img3.png' alt='' title='' width='67' height='67'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But just picking pixels separately—even with the color distribution inferred from actual images—won’t produce images that in any way look “natural” or “realistic”: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img4.png' alt='' title='' width='630' height='48'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And the immediate issue is that the pixels aren’t really independent; most pixels in most images are correlated in color with nearby pixels. And in a first approximation one can capture this for example by <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LearnDistribution.html\">fitting the list of colors of all the pixels</a> to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that represents their correlation. <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RandomVariate.html\">Sampling from this distribution</a> gives images like these—that indeed look somehow “statistically natural”, even if there isn’t appropriate detailed structure in them:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img5A.png' alt='' title='' width='630' height='158'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>So, OK, how can one do better? The basic idea is to use neural nets, which can in effect encode detailed long-range connections between pixels. In some way it’s similar to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#inside-chatgpt\">what&#8217;s done in LLMs like ChatGPT</a>—where one has to deal with long-range connections between words in text. But for images it’s structurally a bit more difficult, because in some sense one has to “consistently fit together 2D patches” rather than just progressively extend a 1D sequence.</p>\n<p>And the typical way this is done at first seems a bit bizarre. The basic idea is to start with a random array of pixels—corresponding in effect to “pure noise”—and then progressively to “reduce the noise” to end up with a “reasonable image” that follows the patterns of typical images, all the while guided by some prompt that says what one wants the “reasonable image” to be of.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attractors-and-inverse-diffusion\">Attractors and Inverse Diffusion</h3>\n<p>How does one go from randomness to definite “reasonable” things? The key is to use the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-7--the-notion-of-attractors\">notion of attractors</a>. In a very simple case, one might have a system—like this “mechanical” example—where from any “randomly chosen” initial condition one also evolves to one of (here) two definite (fixed-point) attractors:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img6_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img6.png' alt='' title='' width='573' height='62'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>One has something similar in a neural net that’s for example <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/050b1a0a-f43a-4c28-b7e0-72607a918467/\">trained to recognize digits</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img7_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img7.png' alt='' title='' width='649' height='30'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Regardless of exactly how each digit is written, or noise that gets added to it, the network will take this input and evolve to an attractor corresponding to a digit. </p>\n<p>Sometimes there can be lots of attractors.

The neural net we’ll use for this is somewhat complicated, with “<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ConvolutionLayer.html\">convolutional</a>” pieces that basically operate on blocks of nearby pixels, and “<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AttentionLayer.html\">transformers</a>” that get applied with certain weights to more distant pixels. Schematically in <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/Stable-Diffusion-V1/\">network looks at a high level like this</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img11_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img11.png' alt='' title='' width='594' height='278'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And roughly what it’s doing is to make an informationally compressed version of each image, and then to expand it again (through what is usually called a “U-net” neural net). We start with an untrained version of this network (say just randomly initialized). Then we feed it a couple of million examples of noisy pictures of <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" /> and <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />, and the denoised outputs we want in each case. </p>\n<p>Then if we take the trained neural net and successively apply it, for example, to a “noised <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />”, the net will “correctly” determine that the “denoised” version is a “pure <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img12_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img12.png' alt='' title='' width='370' height='28'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what if we apply this network to pure noise? The network has been set up to always eventually evolve either to the “<img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />” attractor or the “<img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />” attractor. But which it “chooses” in a particular case will depend on the details of the initial noise—so in effect the network will seem to be picking at random to “fish” either “<img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />” or “<img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/B2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />” out of the noise:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img13_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img13.png' alt='' title='' width='572' height='164'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>How does this apply to our original goal of generating images “like” those found for example on the web? Well, instead of just training our “denoising” (or “inverse diffusion”) network on a couple of “target” images, let’s imagine we train it on billions of images from the web. And let’s also assume that our network isn’t big enough to store all those images in any kind of explicit way.</p>\n<p>In the abstract it’s not clear what the network will do. But the remarkable empirical fact is that it seems to manage to successfully generate (“from noise”) images that “follow the general patterns” of the images it was trained from. There isn’t any clear way to “formally validate” this success. It’s really just a matter of human perception: to us the images (generally) “look right”. </p>\n<p>It could be that with a different (alien?) <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/\">system of perception</a> we’d immediately see “something wrong” with the images. But for purposes of human perception, the neural net seems to give “reasonable-looking” images—perhaps not least because the neural net operates at least approximately like our brains and our processes of perception seem to operate. </p>\n<h3 id=\"injecting-a-prompt\">Injecting a Prompt</h3>\n<p>We’ve described how a denoising neural net seems to be able to start from some configuration of random noise and generate a “reasonable-looking” image. And from any particular configuration of noise, a given neural net will always generate the same image. But there’s no way to tell what that image will be of; it’s just something to empirically explore, as we did above.</p>\n<p>But what if we want to “guide” the neural net to generate an image that we’d describe as being of a definite thing, like “a cat in a party hat”? We could imagine “continually checking” whether the image we’re generating would be recognized by a neural net as being of what we wanted. And conceptually that’s what we can do. But we also need a way to “redirect” the image generation if it’s “not going in the right direction”. And a convenient way to do this is to mix a “description of what we want” right into the denoising training process. In particular, if we’re training to “recover an <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />”, mix a description of the “<img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />” right alongside the image of the “<img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/A2helvetica.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"11\" height=\" \" />”.</p>\n<p>And here we can make use of a key feature of neural nets: that ultimately they operate on arrays of (real) numbers. So whether they’re dealing with images composed of pixels, or text composed of words, all these things eventually have to be “ground up” into arrays of real numbers. And when a neural net is trained, what it’s ultimately “learning” is just how to appropriately transform these “disembodied” arrays of numbers. </p>\n<p>There’s a fairly natural way to generate an array of numbers from an image: just take the triples of red, green and blue intensity values for each pixel. (Yes, we could pick a different detailed representation, but it’s not likely to matter—because the neural net can always effectively “learn a conversion”.) But what about a textual description, like “a cat in a party hat”?</p>\n<p>We need to find a way to encode text as an array of numbers. And actually LLMs face the same issue, and we can solve it in basically <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#the-concept-of-embeddings\">the same way here as LLMs do</a>. In the end what we want is to derive from any piece of text a “feature vector” consisting of an array of numbers that provide some kind of representation of the “effective meaning” of the text, or at least the “effective meaning” relevant to describing images. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we train a neural net to reproduce associations between images and captions, as found for example on the web. If we feed this neural net an image, it’ll try to generate a caption for the image. If we feed the neural net a caption, it’s not realistic for it to generate a whole image. But we can look at the innards of the neural net and see the array of numbers it derived from the caption—and then use this as our feature vector. And the idea is that because captions that “mean the same thing” should be associated in the training set with “the same kind of images”, they should have similar feature vectors. </p>\n<p>So now let’s say we want to generate a picture of a cat in a party hat. First we find the feature vector associated with the text “a cat in a party hat”. Then this is what we keep mixing in at each stage of denoising to guide the denoising process, and end up with an image that the image captioning network will identify as “a cat in a party hat”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-latent-space-“trick”\">The Latent Space “Trick”</h3>\n<p>The most direct way to do “denoising” is to operate directly on the pixels in an image. But it turns out there’s a considerably more efficient approach, which operates not on pixels but on “features” of the image—or, more specifically, on a feature vector which describes an image. </p>\n<p>In a “raw image” presented in terms of pixels, there’s a lot of redundancy—which is why, for example, image formats like JPEG and PNG manage to compress raw images so much without even noticeably modifying them for purposes of typical human perception. But with neural nets it’s possible to do much greater compression, particularly if all we want to do is to preserve the “meaning” of an image, without worrying about its precise details.</p>\n<p>And in fact as part of training a neural net to associate images with captions, we can derive a “latent representation” of images, or in effect a feature vector that captures the “important features” of the image. And then we can do everything we’ve discussed so far directly on this latent representation—decoding it only at the end into the actual pixel representation of the image.</p>\n<p>So what does it look like to build up the latent representation of an image? With the particular setup we’re using here, it turns out that the feature vector in the latent representation still preserves the basic spatial arrangement of the image. The “latent pixels” are much coarser than the “visible” ones, and happen to be characterized by 4 numbers rather than the 3 for RGB. But we can decode things to see the “denoising” process happening in terms of “latent pixels”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img14_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071323sec7img14.png' alt='' title='' width='658' height='67'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And then we can take the latent representation we get, and once again use a trained neural net to fill in a “decoding” of this in terms of actual pixels, getting out our final generated image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-analogy-in-simple-programs\">An Analogy in Simple Programs</h2>\n<p>Generative AI systems work by having attractors that are carefully constructed through training so that they correspond to “reasonable outputs”. A large part of what we’ve done above is to study what happens to these attractors when we change the internal parameters of the system (neural net weights, etc.). What we’ve seen has been complicated, and, indeed, often quite “alien looking”. But is there perhaps a simpler setup in which we can see similar core phenomena?</p>\n<p>By the time we’re thinking about creating attractors for realistic images, etc. it’s inevitable that things are going to be complicated. But what if we look at systems with much simpler setups? For example, consider a dynamical system whose state is characterized just by a single number—such as an iterated map on the interval, like <em>x</em> <img title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123rightarrow.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\" \" /> <em>a</em> <em>x</em> (1 – <em>x</em>).</p>\n<p>Starting from a uniform array of possible <em>x</em> values, we can show down the page which values of <em>x</em> are achieved at successive iterations:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img1.png' alt='' title='' width='613' height='180'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>For <em>a</em> = 2.9, the system evolves from any initial value to a single attractor, which consists of a single fixed final value. But if we change the “internal parameter” <em>a</em> to 3.1, we now get two distinct final values. And at the “bifurcation point” <em>a</em> = 3 there’s a sudden change from one to two distinct final values. And indeed in our generative AI system it’s fairly common to see similar discontinuous changes in behavior even when an internal parameter is continuously changed.</p>\n<p>As another example—slightly closer to image generation—consider (as above) a 1D cellular automaton that exhibits class 2 behavior, and evolves from any initial state to some fixed final state that one can think of as an attractor for the system:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img2.png' alt='' title='' width='575' height='148'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Which attractor one reaches depends on the initial condition one starts from. But—in analogy to our generative AI system—we can think of all the attractors as being “reasonable outputs” for the system. But now what happens if we change the parameters of the system, or in this case, the cellular automaton rule? In particular, what will happen to the attractors? It’s like what we did above in changing weights in a neural net—but a lot simpler.</p>\n<p>The particular rule we’re using here has 4 possible colors for each cell, and is defined by just 64 discrete values from 0 to 3. So let’s say we randomly change just one of those values at a time. Here are some examples of what we get, always starting from the same initial condition as in the first picture above: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img3.png' alt='' title='' width='596' height='285'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>With a couple of exceptions these seem to produce results that are at least “roughly similar” to what we got without changing the rule. In analogy to what we did above, the cat might have changed, but it’s still more or less a cat. But let’s now try “progressive randomization”, where we modify successively more values in the definition of the rule. For a while we again get “roughly similar” results, but then—much like in our cat examples above—things eventually “fall apart” and we get “much more random” results:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img4.png' alt='' title='' width='596' height='285'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>One important difference between “stable diffusion” and cellular automata is that while in cellular automata, the evolution can lead to continued change forever, in stable diffusion there’s an annealing process used that always makes successive steps “progressively smaller”—and essentially forces a fixed point to be reached.</p>\n<p>But notwithstanding this, we can try to get a closer analogy to image generation by looking (again as above) at 2D cellular automata. Here’s an example of the (not-too-exciting-as-images) “final states” reached from three different initial states in a particular rule:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img5.png' alt='' title='' width='573' height='181'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And here’s what happens if one progressively changes the rule:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img6_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/07/sw071123sec8img6.png' alt='' title='' width='594' height='229'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At first one still gets “reasonable-according-to-the-original-rule” final states. But if one changes the rule further, things get “more alien”, until they look to us quite random. </p>\n<p>In changing the rule, one is in effect “<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space\">moving in rulial space</a>”. And by looking at how this works in cellular automata, one can get a certain amount of intuition. (<a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p391--fundamental-issues-in-biology/\">Changes to the rule</a> in a cellular automaton seem a bit like “changes to the genotype” in biology—with the behavior of the cellular automaton representing the corresponding “phenotype”.) But seeing how “rulial motion” works in a generative AI that’s been trained on “human-style input” gives a more accessible and humanized picture of what’s going on, even if it seems still further out of reach in terms of any kind of traditional explicit formalization.</p>\n<h2 id='thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>This project is the first I’ve been able to do with our new <a href=\"https://www.wolframinstitute.org/\">Wolfram Institute</a>.

It’s only been 196 days since we released <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SummaryOfNewFeaturesIn132\">Version 13.2</a>, but there’s a lot that’s new, not least a whole subsystem around LLMs. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWg8exJxNY\">Last Friday (June 23) we celebrated 35 years</a> since <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/\">Version 1.0</a> of Mathematica (and what’s now Wolfram Language). And to me it’s incredible how far we’ve come in these 35 years—yet how consistent we’ve been in our mission and goals, and how well we’ve been able to just keep building on the foundations we created all those years ago.<span id=\"more-51812\"></span></p>\n<p>And when it comes to what’s now Wolfram Language, there’s a wonderful timelessness to it. We’ve worked very hard to make its design as clean and coherent as possible—and to make it a timeless way to elegantly represent computation and everything that can be described through it. </p>\n<p>Last Friday I fired up Version 1 on an old Mac SE/30 computer (with 2.5 megabytes of memory), and it was a thrill see functions like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html\">Plot</a></tt> and <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NestList.html\">NestList</a></tt> work just as they would today—albeit a lot slower. And it was wonderful to be able to take (on a floppy disk) the notebook I created with Version 1 and have it immediately come to life on a modern computer. </p>\n<p>But even as we’ve maintained compatibility over all these years, the scope of our system has grown out of all recognition—with everything in Version 1 now occupying but a small sliver of the whole range of functionality of the modern Wolfram Language:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/updated-88-2023.png' alt='Versions 1.0 and 13.3 of Wolfram Language compared' title='Versions 1.0 and 13.3 of Wolfram Language compared' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>So much about Mathematica was ahead of its time in 1988, and perhaps even more about Mathematica and the Wolfram Language is ahead of its time today, 35 years later. From the whole idea of symbolic programming, to the concept of notebooks, the universal applicability of symbolic expressions, the notion of computational knowledge, and concepts like instant APIs and so much more, we’ve been energetically continuing to push the frontier over all these years.</p>\n<p>Our long-term objective has been to build a full-scale computational language that can represent everything computationally, in a way that’s effective for both computers and humans. And now—in 2023—there’s a new significance to this. Because with the advent of LLMs our language has become a unique bridge between humans, AIs and computation. </p>\n<p>The attributes that make Wolfram Language easy for humans to write, yet rich in expressive power, also make it ideal for LLMs to write. And—unlike traditional programming languages— Wolfram Language is intended not only for humans to write, but also to read and think in. So it becomes the medium through which humans can confirm or correct what LLMs do, to deliver computational language code that can be confidently assembled into a larger system.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language wasn’t originally designed with the recent success of LLMs in mind. But I think it’s a tribute to the strength of its design that it now fits so well with LLMs—with so much synergy. The Wolfram Language is important to LLMs—in providing a way to access computation and computational knowledge from within the LLM. But LLMs are also important to Wolfram Language—in providing a rich linguistic interface to the language. </p>\n<p>We’ve always built—and deployed—Wolfram Language so it can be accessible to as many people as possible. But the advent of LLMs—and <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/06/introducing-chat-notebooks-integrating-llms-into-the-notebook-paradigm/\">our new Chat Notebooks</a>—opens up Wolfram Language to vastly more people. <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\">Wolfram|Alpha</a> lets anyone use natural language—without prior knowledge—to get questions answered. Now with LLMs it’s possible to use natural language to start defining potential elaborate computations. </p>\n<p>As soon as you’ve formulated your thoughts in computational terms, you can immediately “explain them to an LLM”, and have it produce precise Wolfram Language code. Often when you look at that code you’ll realize you didn’t explain yourself quite right, and either the LLM or you can tighten up your code. But anyone—without any prior knowledge—can now get started producing serious Wolfram Language code. And that’s very important in seeing Wolfram Language realize its potential to drive “computational X” for the widest possible range of <nobr>fields X.</nobr></p>\n<p>But while LLMs are “the biggest single story” in Version 13.3, there’s a lot else in Version 13.3 too—delivering the latest from our long-term research and development pipeline. So, yes, in Version 13.3 there’s new functionality not only in LLMs but also in many “classic” areas—as well as in new areas having nothing to do with LLMs.</p>\n<p>Across the 35 years since Version 1 we’ve been able to continue accelerating our research and development process, year by year building on the functionality and automation we’ve created. And we’ve also continually honed our actual process of research and development—for the past 5 years sharing our design meetings on <a href=\"https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/\">open livestreams</a>. </p>\n<p>Version 13.3 is—from its name—an “incremental release”. But—particularly with its new LLM functionality—it continues our tradition of delivering a long list of important advances and updates, even in incremental releases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"llm-tech-comes-to-wolfram-language\">LLM Tech Comes to Wolfram Language</h2>\n<p>LLMs make possible many important new things in the Wolfram Language. And since I’ve been discussing these in <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/wolfram-language/\">a series of recent posts</a>, I’ll just give only a fairly short summary here. More details are in the other posts, both ones that have appeared, and ones that will appear soon.</p>\n<div id=\"gpt-stripe\" style=\"background: #f6fcff87;padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;border: 1px solid #aeccd987;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;margin-bottom: 2.5rem;max-width: 620px;/* font-size: .6rem; */\">\n<p style=\"font-size: .85rem;color: #3f5f6a;line-height: 1.5;padding-bottom: 0;display: inline;\">To ensure you have the latest Chat Notebook functionality installed and available, use: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062923sec2pacletimg2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html' style=\"font-size: .9rem;color: #3f5f6a;padding-left: 0px !important;padding-right: 0px !important;\"><tt>PacletInstall[\"Wolfram/Chatbook\" <img style=\"margin-bottom: 1px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062923sec2rightarrowimg1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\"\" /> \"1.0.0\", UpdatePacletSites <img style=\"margin-bottom: 1px\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062923sec2rightarrowimg1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\"\" /> True]</tt>.</div>\n<p style=\"font-size: .85rem;color: #3f5f6a;line-height: 1.5;padding-bottom: 0;display: inline;\">\n</div>\n<p>The most immediately visible LLM tech in Version 13.3 is Chat Notebooks. Go to <nobr><tt>File</tt> > <tt>New</tt> > <tt>Chat-Enabled Notebook</tt></nobr> and you’ll get a Chat Notebook that supports “chat cells” that let you “talk to” an LLM. Press <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span> (quote) to get a new chat cell:</p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img1-1.png' alt='Plot two sine curves' title='Plot two sine curves' width='620' height='580'></p>\n<p>You might not like some details of what got done (do you really want those boldface labels?) but I consider this pretty impressive. And it’s a great example of using an LLM as a “linguistic interface” with common sense, that can generate precise computational language, which can then be run to get a result.</p>\n<p>This is all very new technology, so we don’t yet know what patterns of usage will work best. But I think it’s going to go like this. First, you have to think computationally about whatever you’re trying to do. Then you tell it to the LLM, and it’ll produce Wolfram Language code that represents what it thinks you want to do. You might just run that code (or the Chat Notebook will do it for you), and see if it produces what you want. Or you might read the code, and see if it’s what you want. But either way, you’ll be using computational language—Wolfram Language—as the medium to formalize and express what you’re trying to do.</p>\n<p>When you’re doing something you’re familiar with, it’ll almost always be faster and better to think directly in Wolfram Language, and just enter the computational language code you want. But if you’re exploring something new, or just getting started on something, the LLM is likely to be a really valuable way to “get you to first code”, and to start the process of crispening up what you want in computational terms.</p>\n<p>If the LLM doesn’t do exactly what you want, then you can tell it what it did wrong, and it’ll try to correct it—though sometimes you can end up doing a lot of explaining and having quite a long dialog (and, yes, it’s often vastly easier just to type Wolfram Language code yourself):</p>\n<p>  <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img2-1.png' alt='Draw red and green semicircles' title='Draw red and green semicircles' width='620' height='957'> </p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img3-1.png' alt='Redraw red and green semicircles' title='Redraw red and green semicircles' width='620' height='1035'></p>\n<p>Sometimes the LLM will notice for itself that something went wrong, and try changing its code, and rerunning it:</p>\n<p>  <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img4.png' alt='Make table of primes' title='Make table of primes' width='620' height='684'> </p>\n<p>And even if it didn’t write a piece of code itself, it’s pretty good at piping up to explain what’s going on when an error is generated: </p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img5-1.png' alt='Error report' title='Error report' width='620' height='291'></p>\n<p>And actually it’s got a big advantage here, because “under the hood” it can look at lots of details (like stack trace, error documentation, etc.) that humans usually don’t bother with.</p>\n<p>To support all this interaction with LLMs, there’s all kinds of new structure in the Wolfram Language. In Chat Notebooks there are chat cells, and there are chatblocks (indicated by gray bars, and generating with <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>~</kbd></span>) that delimit the range of chat cells that will be fed to the LLM when you press <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd></span> on a new chat cell. And, by the way, the whole mechanism of cells, cell groups, etc. that we invented 36 years ago now turns out to be extremely powerful as a foundation for Chat Notebooks.</p>\n<p>One can think of the LLM as a kind of “alternate evaluator” in the notebook. And there are various ways to set up and control it. The most immediate is in the menu associated with every chat cell and every chatblock (and also available in the notebook toolbar):</p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img6-1.png' alt='Chat cell and chatblock menu' title='Chat cell and chatblock menu' width='373' height='359'> </p>\n<p>The first items here let you define the “persona” for the LLM. Is it going to act as a Code Assistant that writes code and comments on it? Or is it just going to be a Code Writer, that writes code without being wordy about it? Then there are some “fun” personas—like <span class=\"promptformatted\">Wolfie</span> and <span class=\"promptformatted\">Birdnardo</span>—that respond “with an attitude”. The <tt>Advanced Settings</tt> let you do things like set the underlying LLM model you want to use—and also what tools (like Wolfram Language code evaluation) you want to connect to it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately personas are mostly just special prompts for the LLM (together, sometimes with tools, etc.) And one of the new things we’ve recently launched to support LLMs is the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/\">Wolfram Prompt Repository</a>:</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/\"><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img7-2.png' alt='Wolfram Prompt Repository' title='Wolfram Prompt Repository' width='620' height=''></a></p>\n<p>The Prompt Repository contains several kinds of prompts. The first are personas, which are used to “style” and otherwise inform chat interactions. But then there are two other types of prompts: function prompts, and modifier prompts.</p>\n<p>Function prompts are for getting the LLM to do something specific, like summarize a piece of text, or suggest a joke (it’s not terribly good at that). Modifier prompts are for determining how the LLM should modify its output, for example translating into a different human language, or keeping it to a certain length.</p>\n<p>You can pull in function prompts from the repository into a Chat Notebook by using <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>!</kbd></span>, and modifier prompts using <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>#</kbd></span>. There’s also a <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>^</kbd></span> notation for saying that you want the “input” to the function prompt to be the cell above:</p>\n<p>  <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img8-1.png' alt='ScientificJargonize' title='ScientificJargonize' width='619' height='117'></p>\n<p>This is how you can access LLM functionality from within a Chat Notebook. But there’s also a whole symbolic programmatic way to access LLMs that we’ve added to the Wolfram Language. Central to this is <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\">LLMFunction</a></tt>, which acts very much like a Wolfram Language pure function, except that it gets “evaluated” not by the Wolfram Language kernel, but by an LLM:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img9_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img9-1.png' alt='' title='' width='599' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can access a function prompt from the Prompt Repository using <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMResourceFunction.html\">LLMResourceFunction</a></tt>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img10_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062723sec2img10-1.png' alt='' title='' width='485' height='54'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s also a symbolic representation for chats.

There’s <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMExampleFunction.html\">LLMExampleFunction</a></tt> for getting an LLM to follow examples you give. There’s <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMTool.html\">LLMTool</a></tt> for giving an LLM a way to call functions in the Wolfram Language as “tools”. And there’s <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\">LLMSynthesize</a></tt> which provides raw access to the LLM as its text completion and other capabilities. (And controlling all of this is <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/$LLMEvaluator.html\">$LLMEvaluator</a></tt> which defines the default LLM configuration to use, as specified by an <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMConfiguration.html\">LLMConfiguration</a></tt> object.) </p>\n<p>I consider it rather impressive that we’ve been able to get to the level of support for LLMs that we have in Version 13.3 in less than six months (along with building things like the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/\">Wolfram Plugin for ChatGPT</a>, and the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/04/instant-plugins-for-chatgpt-introducing-the-wolfram-chatgpt-plugin-kit/\">Wolfram ChatGPT Plugin Kit</a>). But there’s going to be more to come, with LLM functionality increasingly integrated into Wolfram Language and Notebooks, and, yes, Wolfram Language functionality increasingly integrated as a tool into LLMs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"line,-surface-and-contour-integration\">Line, Surface and Contour Integration</h2>\n<p>“Find the integral of the function ___” is a typical core thing one wants to do in calculus. And in <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/\">Mathematica</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> that’s achieved with <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Integrate.html\">Integrate</a></tt>. But particularly in applications of calculus, it’s common to want to ask slightly more elaborate questions, like “What’s the integral of ___ over the region ___?”, or “What’s the integral of ___ along the line ___?”</p>\n<p>Almost a decade ago (in <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/\">Version 10</a>) we introduced a way to specify integration over regions—just by giving the region “geometrically” as the domain of the integral:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img1.png' alt='' title='' width='338' height='71'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>It had always been possible to write out such an integral in “standard <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Integrate.html\">Integrate</a></tt>” form</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img2.png' alt='' title='' width='642' height='71'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>but the region specification is much more convenient—as well as being much more efficient to process.</p>\n<p>Finding an integral along a line is also something that can ultimately be done in “standard <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Integrate.html\">Integrate</a></tt>” form. And if you have an explicit (parametric) formula for the line this is typically fairly straightforward. But if the line is specified in a geometrical way then there’s real work to do to even set up the problem in “standard <a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Integrate.html\"><tt>Integrate</a></tt>” form. So in Version 13.3 we’re introducing the function <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LineIntegrate.html\"><tt>LineIntegrate</tt></a> to automate this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LineIntegrate.html\"><tt>LineIntegrate</tt></a> can deal with integrating both scalar and vector functions over lines. Here’s an example where the line is just a straight line:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img3.png' alt='' title='' width='539' height='75'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LineIntegrate.html\"><tt>LineIntegrate</tt></a> also works for lines that aren’t straight, like this parametrically specified one:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062023sec3img4.png' alt='' title='' width='511' height='90'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>To compute the integral also requires finding the tangent vector at every point on the curve—but <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LineIntegrate.html\"><tt>LineIntegrate</tt></a> automatically does that:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062623sec3Ximg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062623sec3Ximg2.png' alt='' title='' width='503' height='73'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Line integrals are common in applications of calculus to physics.

It’s often a challenge to know that something can be expressed in terms of special functions. But once one’s done this, one can immediately apply the independent knowledge that exists about the special functions.</p>\n<p>Even in <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/\">Version 1.0</a> we already supported many special functions. And over the years we’ve added support for many more—to the point where we now cover everything that might reasonably be considered a “classical” special function. But in recent years we’ve also been tackling more general special functions. They’re mathematically more complex, but each one we successfully cover makes a new collection of problems accessible to exact solution and reliable numerical and symbolic computation.</p>\n<p>Most of the “classic” special functions—like <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BesselFunction.html\">Bessel functions</a>, <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendreFunctionoftheFirstKind.html\">Legendre functions</a>, <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticIntegral.html\">elliptic integrals</a>, etc.—are in the end univariate <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HypergeometricFunction.html\">hypergeometric functions</a>. But one important frontier in “general special functions” are those corresponding to bivariate hypergeometric functions. And already in <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v4/\">Version 4.0</a> (1999) we introduced one example of such as a function: <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF1.html\">AppellF1</a></tt>. And, yes, it’s taken a while, but now in Version 13.3 we’ve finally finished doing the math and creating the algorithms to introduce <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF2.html\"><tt>AppellF2</tt></a>, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF3.html\"><tt>AppellF3</tt></a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF4.html\"><tt>AppellF4</tt></a>.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, it’s just another function—with lots of arguments—whose value we can find to any precision:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img1.png' alt='' title='' width='380' height='47'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Occasionally it has a closed form:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img2.png' alt='' title='' width='392' height='81'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But despite its mathematical sophistication, plots of it tend to look fairly uninspiring:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img3.png' alt='' title='' width='457' height='154'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Series expansions begin to show a little more:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img4.png' alt='' title='' width='485' height='138'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And ultimately this is a function that solves a pair of PDEs that can be seen as a generalization to two variables of the univariate hypergeometric ODE. So what other generalizations are possible? <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Paul+Appell\">Paul Appell</a> spent many years around the turn of the twentieth century looking—and came up with just four, which as of Version 13.3 now all appear in the Wolfram Language, as <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF1.html\">AppellF1</a></tt>, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF2.html\"><tt>AppellF2</tt></a>, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF3.html\"><tt>AppellF3</tt></a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppellF4.html\"><tt>AppellF4</tt></a>.</p>\n<p>To make special functions useful in the Wolfram Language they need to be “knitted” into other capabilities of the language—from numerical evaluation to series expansion, calculus, equation solving, and integral transforms. And in Version 13.3 we’ve passed another special function milestone, around integral transforms. </p>\n<p>When I started using special functions in the 1970s the main source of information about them tended to be a small number of handbooks that had been assembled through decades of work. When we began to build Mathematica and what’s now the Wolfram Language, one of our goals was to subsume the information in such handbooks. And over the years that’s exactly what we’ve achieved—for integrals, sums, differential equations, etc. But one of the holdouts has been integral transforms for special functions. And, yes, we’ve covered a great many of these. But there are exotic examples that can often only “coincidentally” be done in closed form—and that in the past have only been found in books of tables.</p>\n<p>But now in Version 13.3 we can do cases like: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec4img5.png' alt='' title='' width='349' height='121'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And in fact we believe that in Version 13.3 we’ve reached the edge of what’s ever been figured out about <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LaplaceTransform.html\">Laplace transforms</a> for special functions. The most extensive handbook—finally published in 1973—runs to about 400 pages. A few years ago we could do about 55% of the forward Laplace transforms in the book, and 31% of the inverse ones. But now in Version 13.3 we can do 100% of the ones that we can verify as correct (and, yes, there are definitely some mistakes in the book). It’s the end of a long journey, and a satisfying achievement in the quest to make as much mathematical knowledge as possible automatically computable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finite-fields!\">Finite Fields!</h2>\n<p>Ever since <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/\">Version 1.0</a> we’ve been able to do things like factoring polynomials modulo primes. And many packages have been developed that handle specific aspects of finite fields. But in Version 13.3 we now have complete, consistent coverage of all finite fields—and operations with them.</p>\n<p>Here’s our symbolic representation of the field of integers modulo 5 (AKA &#8484;<sub>5</sub> or GF(5)):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img2.png' alt='' title='' width='302' height='78'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And here are symbolic representations of the elements of this field—which in this particular case can be rather trivially identified with ordinary integers mod 5:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec5img3A_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img3A.png' alt='' title='' width='314' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Arithmetic immediately works on these symbolic elements:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img4.png' alt='' title='' width='162' height='70'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But where things get a bit trickier is when we’re dealing with prime-power fields. We represent the field GF(2<sup>3</sup>) symbolically as:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img6_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img6.png' alt='' title='' width='305' height='78'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But now the elements of this field no longer have a direct correspondence with ordinary integers. We can still assign “indices” to them, though (with elements 0 and 1 being the additive and multiplicative identities). So here’s an example of an operation in this field:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img7_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec5img7.png' alt='' title='' width='134' height='59'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what actually is this result?

Here’s a simple example, just using the function <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html\">Plot</a></tt>. Instead of just producing static curves, <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html\">Plot</a></tt> now automatically generates a visualization with interactive highlighting:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec7img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/Video1-Plot-2.gif' alt='' title='' width='414' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The same thing works for <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListPlot.html\">ListPlot</a></tt>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec7img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec7img2.png' alt='' title='' width='405' height='265'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The highlighting can, for example, show dates too:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec7img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec7img3.png' alt='' title='' width='466' height='246'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are many choices for how the highlighting should be done. The simplest thing is just to specify a style in which to highlight whole curves: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec7img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/Video2-PlotHighlighting-2.gif' alt='' title='' width='431' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But there are many other built-in highlighting specifications.

And we’re always looking for ways to share and communicate 3D geometry. Already back in the early 1990s we had experimental implementations of VR. But at the time there wasn’t anything like the kind of infrastructure for VR that would be needed to make this broadly useful. In the mid-2010s we then introduced VR functionality based on Unity—that provides powerful capabilities within the Unity ecosystem, but is not accessible outside.</p>\n<p>Today, however, it seems there are finally broad standards emerging for AR and VR. And so in Version 13.3 we’re able to begin delivering what we hope will provide widely accessible AR and VR deployment from the Wolfram Language. </p>\n<p>At a underlying level what we’re doing is to support the USD and GLTF geometry representation formats. But we’re also building a higher-level interface that allows anyone to “publish” 3D geometry for AR and VR.</p>\n<p>Given a piece of geometry (which for now can’t involve too many polygons), all you do is apply <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ARPublish.html\"><tt>ARPublish</tt></a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062823ARpublishAimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062123sec8img1A.png' alt='' title='' width='229' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The result is a cloud object that has a certain underlying UUID, but is displayed in a notebook as a QR code. Now all you do is look at this QR code with your phone (or tablet, etc.) camera, and press the URL it extracts.</p>\n<p>The result will be that the geometry you published with <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ARPublish.html\"><tt>ARPublish</tt></a> now appears in AR on your phone:</p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/triptych-AR-v2.png' alt='Augmented reality triptych' title='Augmented reality triptych' width='620' height=''></p>\n<p>Move your phone and you’ll see that your geometry has been realistically placed into the scene. You can also go to a VR “object” mode in which you can manipulate the geometry on your phone.</p>\n<p>“Under the hood” there are some slightly elaborate things going on—particularly in providing the appropriate data to different kinds of phones. But the result is a first step in the process of easily being able to get AR and VR output from the Wolfram Language—deployed in whatever devices support AR and VR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-the-details-right:-the-continuing-story\">Getting the Details Right: The Continuing Story</h2>\n<p>In every version of Wolfram Language we add all sorts of fundamentally new capabilities. But we also work to fill in details of existing capabilities, continually pushing to make them as general, consistent and accurate as possible. In Version 13.3 there are many details that have been “made right”, in many different areas. </p>\n<p>Here’s one example: the comparison (and sorting) of <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Around.html\">Around</a></tt> objects. Here are 10 random “numbers with uncertainty”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img1.png' alt='' title='' width='579' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>These sort by their central value:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img2.png' alt='' title='' width='579' height='44'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But if we look at these, many of their uncertainty regions overlap:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img3.png' alt='' title='' width='299' height='194'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>So when should we consider a particular number-with-uncertainty “greater than” another? In Version 13.3 we carefully take into account uncertainty when making comparisons. So, for example, this gives <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html\">True:</a></tt></p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img4.png' alt='' title='' width='276' height='43'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But when there’s too big an uncertainty in the values, we no longer consider the ordering “certain enough”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img5.png' alt='' title='' width='276' height='43'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here’s another example of consistency: the applicability of <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Duration.html\">Duration</a></tt>. We introduced <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Duration.html\">Duration</a></tt> to apply to explicit time constructs, things like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Audio.html\">Audio</a></tt> objects, etc. But in Version 13.3 it also applies to entities for which there’s a reasonable way to define a “duration”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img6_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img6.png' alt='' title='' width='388' height='58'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img7_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img7.png' alt='' title='' width='362' height='62'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Dates (and times) are complicated things—and we’ve put a lot of effort into handling them correctly and consistently in the Wolfram Language. One concept that we introduced a few years ago is date granularity: the (subtle) analog of numerical precision for dates. But at first only some date functions supported granularity; now in Version 13.3 all date functions include a <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DateGranularity.html\">DateGranularity</a></tt> option—so that granularity can consistently be tracked through all date-related operations:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img8_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img8.png' alt='' title='' width='377' height='55'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Also in dates, something that’s been added, particularly for astronomy, is the ability to deal with “years” specified by real numbers:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img9_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img9.png' alt='' title='' width='491' height='57'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And one consequence of this is that it becomes easier to make a plot of something like astronomical distance as a function of time:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img10_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img10.png' alt='' title='' width='615' height='187'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Also in astronomy, we’ve been steadily extending our capabilities to consistently fill in computations for more situations. In Version 13.3, for example, we can now compute sunrise, etc. not just from points on Earth, but from points anywhere in the solar system:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img11_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img11.png' alt='' title='' width='367' height='66'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>By the way, we’ve also made the computation of sunrise more precise. So now if you ask for the position of the Sun right at sunrise you’ll get a result like this:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img12_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec9img12.png' alt='' title='' width='332' height='89'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>How come the altitude of the Sun is not zero at sunrise? That’s because the disk of the Sun is of nonzero size, and “sunrise” is defined to be when any part of the Sun pokes over the horizon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"even-easier-to-type:-affordances-for-wolfram-language-input\">Even Easier to Type: Affordances for Wolfram Language Input</h2>\n<p>Back in 1988 when what’s now Wolfram Language first existed, the only way to type it was like ordinary text. But gradually we’ve introduced more and more “affordances” to make it easier and faster to type correct Wolfram Language input. In 1996, with <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v3/\">Version 3</a>, we introduced automatic spacing (and spanning) for operators, as well as brackets that flashed when they matched—and things like -> being automatically replaced by <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''>. Then in 2007, with <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v6/\">Version 6</a>, we introduced—with some trepidation at first—syntax coloring. We’d had a way to request autocompletion of a symbol name all the way back to the beginning, but it’d never been good or efficient enough for us to make it happen all the time as you type. But in 2012, for <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v9/guide/Mathematica.html\">Version 9</a>, we created a much more elaborate autocomplete system—that was useful and efficient enough that we turned it on for all notebook input. A key feature of this autocomplete system was its context-sensitive knowledge of the Wolfram Language, and how and where different symbols and strings typically appear. Over the past decade, we’ve gradually refined this system to the point where I, for one, deeply rely on it.</p>\n<p>In recent versions, we’ve made other “typability” improvements. For example, in <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/language/v12.3/\">Version 12.3</a>, we generalized the -> to <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> transformation to a whole collection of “auto operator renderings”. Then in <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/language/v13/\">Version 13.0</a> we introduced “automatching” of brackets, in which, for example, if you enter <tt>[</tt> at the end of what you’re typing, you’ll automatically get a matching <tt>]</tt>. </p>\n<p>Making “typing affordances” work smoothly is a painstaking and tricky business. But in every recent version we’ve steadily been adding more features that—in very “natural” ways—make it easier and faster to type Wolfram Language input. </p>\n<p>In Version 13.3 one major change is an enhancement to autocompletion. Instead of just showing pure completions in which characters are appended to what’s already been typed, the autocompletion menu now includes “fuzzy completions” that fill in intermediate characters, change capitalization, etc.</p>\n<p>So, for example, if you type “<span class=\"computer-voice\">lp</span>” you now get <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListPlot.html\">ListPlot</a></tt> as a completion (the little underlines indicate where the letters you actually type appear):</p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec10img2B.png' alt='ListPlot autocompletion menu' title='ListPlot automcompletion menu' width='152' height=''> </p>\n<p>From a design point of view one thing that’s important about this is that it further removes the “short name” premium—and weights things even further on the side of wanting names that explain themselves when they’re read, rather than that are easy to type in an unassisted way. With the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/\">Wolfram Function Repository</a> it’s become increasingly common to want to type <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ResourceFunction.html\">ResourceFunction</a></tt>. And we’d been thinking that perhaps we should have a special, short notation for that. But with the new autocompletion, one can operationally just press three <nobr>keys—<span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>r</kbd><kbd>f</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd></span>—</nobr>to get to <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ResourceFunction.html\">ResourceFunction</a></tt>:</p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/rfmenu-v3.png' alt='ResourceFunction autocompletion menu' title='ResourceFunction autocompletion menu' width='163' height=''></p>\n<p>When one designs something and gets the design right, people usually don’t notice; things just “work as they expect”. But when there’s a design error, that’s when people notice—and are frustrated by—the design. But then there’s another case: a situation where, for example, there are two things that could happen, and sometimes one wants one, and sometimes the other. In doing the design, one has to pick a particular branch. And when this happens to be the branch people want, they don’t notice, and they’re happy. But if they want the other branch, it can be confusing and frustrating.</p>\n<p>In the design of the Wolfram Language one of the things that has to be chosen is the precedence for every operator: <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> × <em>c</em> means <em>a</em> + (<em>b</em> × <em>c</em>) because × has higher precedence than +. Often the correct order of precedences is fairly obvious. But sometimes it’s simply impossible to make everyone happy all the time. And so it is with <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> and <tt>&</tt>. It’s very convenient to be able to add <tt>&</tt> at the end of something you type, and make it into a pure function. But that means if you type <nobr><em>a</em> <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> <em>b</em> <tt>&</tt></nobr> it’ll turn the whole thing into a function: <tt><em>a</em> <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> <em>b</em> &</tt>. When functions have options, however, one often wants things like <em>name</em> <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> <em>function</em>. The natural tendency is to type this as <em>name</em> <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> <em>body</em> <tt>&</tt>. But this will mean (<em>name</em> <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> <em>body</em>) <tt>&</tt> rather than <em>name</em> <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423plainarrow.png' alt='' title='' width='17' height=''> (<em>body</em> <tt>&</tt>). And, yes, when you try to run the function, it’ll notice it doesn’t have correct arguments and options specified. But you’d like to know that what you’re typing isn’t right as soon as you type it. And now in Version 13.3 we have a mechanism for that. As soon as you enter <tt>&</tt> to “end a function”, you’ll see the extent of the function flash:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec10img13_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/purefunction-highlight-1-v2-1.gif' alt='' title='' width='555' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yup, you can see that’s wrong.

We’ve had <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ActionMenu.html\">ActionMenu</a></tt> since 2007—but it’s only been able to create one-level menus. In Version 13.3 it’s been extended to arbitrary hierarchical menus:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec10img15_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/action-menu-arrows.png' alt='' title='' width='577' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Again not directly related to typing, but now relevant to managing and editing code, there’s an update in Version 13.3 to package editing in the notebook interface. Bring up a .wl file and it’ll appear as a notebook. But its default toolbar is different from the usual notebook toolbar (and is newly designed in Version 13.3):</p>\n<p>  <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062223sec10img18.png' alt='New default toolbar' title='New default toolbar' width='603' height='51'></p>\n<p><tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\">Go To</tt> now gives you a way to immediately go to the definition of any function whose name matches what you type, as well as any section, etc.:</p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/WL-Toolbar2-v3.png' alt='Go To results' title='Go To results' width='480' height=''></p>\n<p>The numbers on the right here are code line numbers; you can also go directly to a specific line number by typing :<em>nnn</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-elegant-code-project\">The Elegant Code Project</h2>\n<p>One of the central goals—and achievements—of the Wolfram Language is to create a computational language that can be used not only as a way to tell computers what to do, but also as a way to communicate computational ideas for human consumption. In other words, Wolfram Language is intended not only to be written by humans (for consumption by computers), but also to be read by humans. </p>\n<p>Crucial to this is the broad consistency of the Wolfram Language, as well as its use of carefully chosen natural-language-based names for functions, etc. But what can we do to make Wolfram Language as easy and pleasant as possible to read? In the past we’ve balanced our optimization of the appearance of Wolfram Language between reading and writing. But in Version 13.3 we’ve got the beginnings of our Elegant Code project—to find ways to render Wolfram Language to be specifically optimized for reading.</p>\n<p>As an example, here’s a small piece of code (from my <em><a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/\">An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language</a></em>), shown in the default way it’s rendered in notebooks:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img2.png' alt='' title='' width='487' height='18'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But in Version 13.3 you can use <tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\">Format</tt> > <tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\">Screen Environment</tt> > <tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\">Elegant</tt> to set a notebook to use the current version of “elegant code”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img1.png' alt='' title='' width='487' height='15'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>(And, yes, this is what we&#8217;re actually using for code in this post, as well as some other recent ones.) So what’s the difference? First of all, we’re using a proportionally spaced font that makes the names (here of symbols) easy to “read like words”. And second, we’re adding space between these “words”, and graying back “structural elements” like <img loading='lazy' style=\"margin-bottom: -3px\"src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423leftbracket.png' alt='' title='' width='8' height=''> &#8230; <img loading='lazy' style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\"src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423rightbracket.png' alt='' title='' width='8' height=''> and <img loading='lazy' style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\"src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423leftbrace.png' alt='' title='' width='8' height=''> &#8230; <img loading='lazy' style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\"src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423rightbrace.png' alt='' title='' width='8' height=''>. When you write a piece of code, things like these structural elements need to stand out enough for you to “see they’re right”. But when you’re reading code, you don’t need to pay as much attention to them. Because the Wolfram Language is so based on “word-like” names, you can typically “understand what it’s saying” just by “reading these words”.</p>\n<p>Of course, making code “elegant” is not just a question of formatting; it’s also a question of what’s actually in the code. And, yes, as with writing text, it takes effort to craft code that “expresses itself elegantly”. But the good news is that the Wolfram Language—through its uniquely broad and high-level character—makes it surprisingly straightforward to create code that expresses itself extremely elegantly.</p>\n<p>But the point now is to make that code not only elegant in content, but also elegant in formatting. In technical documents it’s common to see math that’s at least formatted elegantly. But when one sees code, more often than not, it looks like something only a machine could appreciate. Of course, if the code is in a traditional programming language, it’ll usually be long and not really intended for human consumption. But what if it’s elegantly crafted Wolfram Language code? Well then we’d like it to look as attractive as text and math. And that’s the point of our Elegant Code project.</p>\n<p>There are many tradeoffs, and many issues to be navigated. But in Version 13.3 we’re definitely making progress. Here’s an example that doesn’t have so many “words”, but where the elegant code formatting still makes the “blocking” of the code more obvious:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img4.png' alt='' title='' width='363' height='67'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here’s a slightly longer piece of code, where again the elegant code formatting helps pull out “readable” words, as well as making the overall structure of the code more obvious: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img5.png' alt='' title='' width='385' height='92'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Particularly in recent years, we’ve added many mechanisms to let one write Wolfram Language that’s easier to read. There are the auto operator renderings, like <tt>m[[i]]</tt> turning into <img style=\"margin-bottom: -4px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11imgmiEC.png' alt='' title='' width='36' height=''>.

One particularly important element is <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Iconize.html\">Iconize</a></tt>, which lets you show any piece of Wolfram Language input in a visually “iconized” form—which nevertheless evaluates just like the corresponding underlying expression:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img6_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec11img6.png' alt='' title='' width='441' height='50'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p><tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Iconize.html\">Iconize</a></tt> lets you effectively hide details (like large amounts of data, option settings, etc.) But sometimes you want to highlight things.

Like formats, characters or entity types—or, for that matter, entries in the Wolfram Function Repository, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/WolframDataRepository.html\">Wolfram Data Repository</a>, etc. Well, in Version 13.3 we’ve done a first iteration of crosslinking all these kinds of things.</p>\n<p>So here now are the &#8220;See Also&#8221; areas for <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graph.html\"><tt>Graph</tt></a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Molecule.html\"><tt>Molecule</tt></a>:</p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/seealso-graph.png' alt='Graph see also options' title='Graph see also options' width='620' height=''> </p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/seealso-molecule.png' alt='Molecule see also options' title='Molecule see also options' width='620' height=''> </p>\n<p>Not only are there functions here; there are also other kinds of things that a person (or AI) looking at these pages might find relevant. </p>\n<p>It’s great to be able to follow links, but sometimes it’s better just to have material immediately accessible, without following a link. Back in <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/\">Version 1.0</a> we made the decision that when a function inherits some of its options from a “base function” (say <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html\">Plot</a></tt> from <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graphics.html\">Graphics</a></tt>), we only need to explicitly list the non-inherited option values. At the time, this was a good way to save a little paper in the printed book. But now the optimization is different, and finally in Version 13.3 we have a way to show “All Options”—tucked away so it doesn’t distract from the typically-more-important non-inherited options.</p>\n<p>Here’s the setup for <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html\">Plot</a></tt>.

It’s not yet realistic to do this at all well on anything but a high-end (and typically server) GPU-enabled machine. But in Version 13.3 there’s now a built-in function <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageSynthesize.html\"><tt>ImageSynthesize</tt></a> that can get images synthesized, for now through an external API.</p>\n<p>You give text, and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageSynthesize.html\"><tt>ImageSynthesize</tt></a> will try to generate images for which that text is a description:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec13img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec13img1.png' alt='' title='' width='595' height='159'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Sometimes these images will be directly useful in their own right, perhaps as “theming images” for documents or user interfaces.

The goal is to be able to compute with models of engineering and other systems that can be described by (potentially very large) collections of ordinary differential equations and their discrete analogs. Our separate <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/\">Wolfram System Modeler</a> product provides an IDE and GUI for graphically creating such models.</p>\n<p>For the past five years we’ve been able to do high-efficiency simulation of these models from within the Wolfram Language. And over the past few years we’ve been adding all sorts of higher-level functionality for programmatically creating models, and for systematically analyzing their behavior. A major focus in recent versions has been the synthesis of control systems, and various forms of controllers.</p>\n<p>Version 13.3 now tackles a different issue, which is the alignment of models with real-world systems. The idea is to have a model which contains certain parameters, and then to determine these parameters by essentially fitting the model’s behavior to observed behavior of a real-world system. </p>\n<p>Let’s start by talking about a simple case where our model is just defined by a single ODE:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img1.png' alt='' title='' width='435' height='138'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>This ODE is simple enough that we can find its analytical solution:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img2.png' alt='' title='' width='330' height='73'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>So now let’s make some “simulated real-world data” assuming <nobr><em>a</em> = 2,</nobr> and with some noise:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img4.png' alt='' title='' width='603' height='14'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here’s what the data looks like:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img5_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec14img5.png' alt='' title='' width='305' height='195'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now let’s try to “calibrate” our original model using this data.

But a few years ago we started introducing capabilities for having the Wolfram Language ask questions of humans, and then assessing their answers. </p>\n<p>In recent versions we’ve been building up sophisticated ways to construct and deploy “quizzes” and other collections of questions. But one of the core issues is always how to determine whether a person has answered a particular question correctly. Sometimes that’s easy to determine. If we ask “What is 2 + 2?”, the answer better be “4” (or conceivably “four”). But what if we ask a question where the answer is some algebraic expression? The issue is that there may be many mathematically equal forms of that expression. And it depends on what exactly one’s asking whether one considers a particular form to be the “right answer” or not.</p>\n<p>For example, here we’re computing a derivative:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec16img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec16img1.png' alt='' title='' width='157' height='47'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And here we’re doing a factoring problem:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec16img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec16img2.png' alt='' title='' width='178' height='44'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>These two answers are mathematically equal. And they’d both be “reasonable answers” for the derivative if it appeared as a question in a calculus course. But in an algebra course, one wouldn’t want to consider the unfactored form a “correct answer” to the factoring problem, even though it’s “mathematically equal”.</p>\n<p>And to deal with these kinds of issues, we’re introducing in Version 13.3 more detailed mathematical assessment functions.

And certainly for me it’s been critical in a whole range of research projects I’ve done. I currently have 156 cores routinely available in my “home” setup, distributed across 6 machines. It’s sometimes challenging from a system administration point of view to keep all those machines and their networking running as one wants. And one of the things we’ve been doing in recent versions—and now completed in Version 13.3—is to make it easier from within the Wolfram Language to see and manage what’s going on.</p>\n<p>It all comes down to specifying the configuration of kernels. And in Version 13.3 that’s now done using symbolic <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/KernelConfiguration.html\">KernelConfiguration</a></tt> objects. Here’s an example of one:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062623sec17img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec17img1-edit.png' alt='' title='' width='481' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s all sorts of information in the kernel configuration object:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062623sec17img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec17img2-edit2.png' alt='' title='' width='579' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>It describes “where” a kernel with that configuration will be, how to get to it, and how it should be launched.

Direct Access to External Libraries</h2>\n<p>Let’s say you’ve got an external library written in C—or in some other language that can compile to a C-compatible library. In Version 13.3 there’s now foreign function interface (FFI) capability that allows you to directly call any function in the external library just using Wolfram Language code. </p>\n<p>Here’s a very trivial C function:</p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img0.png' alt='Trivial C function' title='Trivial C function' width='145' height=''></p>\n<p>This function happens to be included in compiled form in the <tt>compilerDemoBase</tt> library that’s part of Wolfram Language documentation.

All you need do is specify the library and C function, and then give the type signature for the function:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img1.png' alt='' title='' width='598' height='78'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now <tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\">ff</tt> is a Wolfram Language function that calls the C <span class=\"computer-voice\">addone</span> function:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img2.png' alt='' title='' width='95' height='43'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The C function <span class=\"computer-voice\">addone</span> happens to have a particularly simple type signature, that can immediately be represented in terms of compiler types that have direct analogs as Wolfram Language expressions. But in working with low-level languages, it’s very common to have to deal directly with raw memory, which is something that never happens when you’re purely working at the Wolfram Language level.</p>\n<p>So, for example, in the OpenSSL library there’s a function called <span class=\"computer-voice\">RAND_bytes</span>, whose C type signature is:</p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img2X.png' alt='RAND_bytes' title='RAND_bytes' width='320' height=''></p>\n<p>And the important thing to notice is that this contains a pointer to a buffer <span class=\"computer-voice\">buf</span> that gets filled by <span class=\"computer-voice\">RAND_bytes</span>. If you were calling <span class=\"computer-voice\">RAND_bytes</span> from C, you’d first allocate memory for this buffer, then—after calling <span class=\"computer-voice\">RAND_bytes</span>—read back whatever was written to the buffer. So how can you do something analogous when you’re calling <span class=\"computer-voice\">RAND_bytes</span> using <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ForeignFunction.html\"><tt>ForeignFunction</tt></a> in Wolfram Language? In Version 13.3 we’re introducing a family of constructs for working with pointers and raw memory. </p>\n<p>So, for example, here’s how we can create a Wolfram Language foreign function corresponding to <span class=\"computer-voice\">RAND_bytes</span>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img3.png' alt='' title='' width='551' height='113'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But to actually use this, we need to be able to allocate the buffer, which in Version 13.3 we can do with <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RawMemoryAllocate.html\"><tt>RawMemoryAllocate</tt></a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img4.png' alt='' title='' width='389' height='108'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>This creates a buffer that can store 10 unsigned chars.

But <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RawMemoryAllocate.html\"><tt>RawMemoryAllocate</tt></a> creates a <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ManagedObject.html\"><tt>ManagedObject</tt></a>, which keeps track of whether it’s being referenced, and automatically frees the memory that’s been allocated when nothing references it anymore.</p>\n<p>Long ago languages like BASIC provided PEEK and POKE functions for reading and writing raw memory. It was always a dangerous thing to do—and it’s still dangerous. But it’s somewhat higher level in Wolfram Language, where in Version 13.3 there are now functions like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RawMemoryRead.html\">RawMemoryRead</a></tt> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RawMemoryWrite.html\"><tt>RawMemoryWrite</tt></a>. (For writing data into a buffer, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RawMemoryExport.html\"><tt>RawMemoryExport</tt></a> is also relevant.)</p>\n<p>Most of the time it’s very convenient to deal with memory-managed <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ManagedObject.html\"><tt>ManagedObject</tt></a> constructs. But for the full low-level experience, Version 13.3 provides <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/UnmanageObject.html\"><tt>UnmanageObject</tt></a>, which disconnects automatic memory management for a managed object, and requires you to explicitly use <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RawMemoryFree.html\"><tt>RawMemoryFree</tt></a> to free it.</p>\n<p>One feature of C-like languages is the concept of a function pointer. And normally the function that the pointer is pointing to is just something like a C function. But in Version 13.3 there’s another possibility: it can be a function defined in Wolfram Language. Or, in other words, from within an external C function it’s possible to call back into the Wolfram Language. </p>\n<p>Let’s use this C program:</p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img6X.png' alt='C program' title='C program' width='306' height=''></p>\n<p>You can actually compile it right from Wolfram Language using:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062523sec18cdlibimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062523sec18cdlibimg1.png' alt='' title='' width='348' height='110'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we load <tt>frun</tt> as a foreign function—with a type signature that uses <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/compiledtype/OpaqueRawPointer.html\">\"OpaqueRawPointer\"</a></tt> to represent the function pointer:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img9_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img9.png' alt='' title='' width='641' height='78'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>What we need next is to create a function pointer that points to a callback to Wolfram Language:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img10_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062323sec18img10.png' alt='' title='' width='587' height='124'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The Wolfram Language function here is just <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Echo.html\">Echo</a></tt>.

And you can do this using the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LibraryFunctionDeclaration.html\"><tt>LibraryFunctionDeclaration</tt></a> mechanism that was introduced in Version 13.1. It’ll be more complicated to set up, and it’ll require an explicit compilation step, but there’ll be slightly less “overhead” in calling the external functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-advance-of-the-compiler-continues\">The Advance of the Compiler Continues</h2>\n<p>For several years we’ve had an ambitious project to develop a large-scale compiler for the Wolfram Language. And in each successive version we’re further extending and enhancing the compiler. In Version 13.3 we’ve managed to compile more of the compiler itself (which, needless to say, is written in Wolfram Language)—thereby making the compiler more efficient in compiling code. We’ve also enhanced the performance of the code generated by the compiler—particularly by optimizing memory management done in the compiled code.</p>\n<p>Over the past several versions we’ve been steadily making it possible to compile more and more of the Wolfram Language. But it’ll never make sense to compile everything—and in Version 13.3 we’re adding <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/KernelEvaluate.html\"><tt>KernelEvaluate</tt></a> to make it more convenient to call back from compiled code to the Wolfram Language kernel. </p>\n<p>Here’s an example:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec19img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw062423sec19img1.png' alt='' title='' width='605' height='127'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We’ve got an argument <em>n</em> that’s declared as being of type <tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\"><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/compiledtype/MachineInteger.html\">MachineInteger</a></tt>. Then we’re doing a computation on <em>n</em> in the kernel, and using <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TypeHint.html\">TypeHint</a></tt> to specify that its result will be of type <tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\"><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/compiledtype/MachineInteger.html\">MachineInteger</a></tt>.

For example, <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Cast.html\">Cast</a></tt> now allows data types to be cast in a way that directly emulates what the C language does. There’s also now <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SequenceType.html\"><tt>SequenceType</tt></a>, which is a type analogous to the Wolfram Language <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sequence.html\">Sequence</a></tt> construct—and able to represent an arbitrary-length sequence of arguments to a function. </p>\n<h2 id=\"and-much-more...\">And Much More&#8230;</h2>\n<p>In addition to everything we’ve already discussed here, there are lots of other updates and enhancements in Version 13.3—as well as thousands of bug fixes. </p>\n<p>Some of the additions fill out corners of functionality, adding completeness or consistency. Statistical fitting functions like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LinearModelFit.html\">LinearModelFit</a></tt> now accept input in all various association etc. forms that machine learning functions like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Classify.html\">Classify</a></tt> accept. <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TourVideo.html\">TourVideo</a></tt> now lets you “tour” <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GeoGraphics.html\">GeoGraphics</a></tt>, with waypoints specified by geo positions. <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ByteArray.html\">ByteArray</a></tt> now supports the “corner case” of zero-length byte arrays.

And, yes, eventually the basic concepts of Notebooks were widely copied—though still not even with everything we had back in 1987!</p>\n<p>Well, now there’s a new challenge and opportunity for Notebooks: integrating LLM functionality into them. It’s an interesting design problem, and I’m pretty pleased with what we’ve come up with. And today we’re introducing Chat Notebooks as a new kind of Notebook that supports LLM-based chat functionality.<span id=\"more-51358\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"gpt-stripe\" style=\"background: #f6fcff87;padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;border: 1px solid #aeccd987;font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;margin-bottom: 2.5rem;max-width: 620px;/* font-size: .6rem; */\">\n<p style=\"font-size: .85rem;color: #3f5f6a;line-height: 1.5;padding-bottom: 0;display: inline;\">The functionality described here will be built into the upcoming version of <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> (Version 13.3).

One that I’m particularly excited about—especially because of its potential to open up computational language to so many people—is for providing interactive <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> assistance. But I’ll talk about that separately. And instead here I’ll concentrate on the (already very rich) general concept of Chat Notebooks.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is simple: there’s a new kind of cell—a chat cell—that communicates with an LLM. (In what we’re calling “Chat-Driven Notebooks” chat cells are the default; in “Chat-Enabled Notebooks” you get a chat cell by pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span>—i.e. quote—when you first create the cell.)</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<video loading='lazy' height=\"auto\" width=\"639\" style=\"margin-left:0px\" muted=\"\" alt=\"Crocodile joke chat\" title=\"Crocodile joke chat\" style=\"margin-bottom: -15px\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/Crocodile-Joke-v2.mp4\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" playsinline><br />\n</video>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL'\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='z13_out_text'></span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='z13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In a standard Notebook, we’re used to having input cells containing Wolfram Language, together with output cells that give the results from evaluating that Wolfram Language input:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg3.png' alt='' title='' width='404' height='89'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And at a basic level, a chat cell is just a type of cell that uses an LLM—rather than the Wolfram Language kernel—to “evaluate” its output. And indeed, in a Chat Notebook, the way you send your input to the LLM is to press <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd></span>, just like for Wolfram Language input.</p>\n<p>And just like for standard input and output cells, chat input and output cells are grouped, so you can select them together, or double-click one of them to open or close them:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723croc-dataset-2.gif' alt='Opening and closing cells' title='Opening and closing cells' width='500' height=''/></p>\n<p>One immediate difference with chat cells is that whereas an ordinary output cell is produced all at once, the contents of a chat output cell progressively “stream in” a word (or so) at a time, as the LLM generates it.</p>\n<p>There’s another important difference too. In an ordinary Notebook there’s a “temporal thread of evaluation” in which inputs and outputs appear in the sequence they’re generated in time (as indicated by <tt>In[<em>n</em>]</tt> and <tt>Out[<em>n</em>]</tt>, quite independent of where they are placed in the Notebook. Thus, for example, if you evaluate <tt>x = 5</tt> in an input cell, then subsequently ask for the value of <tt>x</tt>, the result will be 5 wherever in the notebook you ask—even if it’s above the “<tt>x = 5</tt>” cell:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg7A.png' alt='x = 5 calculations' title='x = 5 calculations' width='224' height=''/></p>\n<p>But with chat cells it’s a different story. Now the order of cells in the Notebook matters. The “thread of a chat” is determined not by when chat cells were evaluated, but instead by the order in which they appear in the notebook. </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg8.png' alt='Order of chat cells in thread' title='Order of chat cells in thread' width='695' height=''/></p>\n<p>Going down the notebook, successive chat cells are “aware” of what’s in cells above them. But even if we add it later, a cell placed at the top won’t “know about” anything in cells below it.</p>\n<p>All of this reflects an important difference between ordinary Wolfram Language evaluation and “LLM evaluation”. In Wolfram Language evaluation, the Wolfram Language kernel always has an internal state, and whatever you do in the notebook is in a sense merely a window into that state. But for LLM evaluation the whole state is determined by the actual content of the notebook.</p>\n<p>And each time you do an LLM evaluation, the Notebook system will package up all the content above the cell in which you’re doing the evaluation, and send it to the LLM. The LLM in a sense never knows anything about time history; all it knows is what’s in the notebook when the LLM evaluation is done.</p>\n<p>There are many consequences of this. One is that you can edit the chat history and “reevaluate with new history”. When the reevaluation “overwrites” a cell, the Chat Notebook will maintain the older version, and you can get back to it by pressing the <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd style=\"color: gray;font-size: 12px;padding: 0 .18rem 0 .1rem;\">◄</kbd></span><span class=\"kbd\"><kbd style=\"color: gray;font-size: 12px; padding: 0 .1rem 0 .18rem;\">►</kbd></span> arrows (for purposes of LLM evaluation, the chat history is always considered to be what’s showing when you do the evaluation):</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<video loading='lazy' height=\"auto\" width=\"639\" style=\"margin-left:0px\" muted=\"\" alt=\"Name change chat scenario\" title=\"Name change chat scenario\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/BobBill-2.mp4\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" playsinline><br />\n</video>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>LLM evaluations pick up content that appears above them in the notebook. But there’s an important way to limit this, and to separate or “modularize” chats: the idea of a chatblock. </p>\n<p>You can begin a chatblock by pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>~</kbd></span> (tilde) when you create a cell in the Notebook you’ll then get:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg12B.png' alt='Chatblock separator' title='Chatblock separator' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>And the point is that this indicates the beginning of a new chat. When you evaluate a chat cell below this separator, it’ll only use content up to the separator—so that means that in a single Chat Notebook, you can have any number of independent “chat sessions”, delimited by chatblock separators:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg13.png' alt='Name chat' title='Name chat' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>In a sense LLM evaluation is a very Notebook-centric form of evaluation, always based on the sequence of content that appears in the Notebook. As we’ll discuss below, there are different detailed forms of LLM evaluation, but in most cases the evaluation will operate not just on chat cells, but on all cells that appear above it in a given chatblock.</p>\n<p>Another difference from ordinary evaluation is that LLM evaluation can often not be repeatable. Yes, if there are random numbers, or external inputs, ordinary Wolfram Language evaluation may not be repeatable. But the core evaluation process in Wolfram Language is completely repeatable. In an LLM, however, that may not be the case. For example, particularly if the LLM is operated with a nonzero value of its “temperature” parameter (which is usually the default), it’s pretty much guaranteed to give different results every time an evaluation is done. </p>\n<p>And in using Chat Notebooks, it’ll sometimes be convenient to just try to evaluate a chat cell multiple times until you get what you want. (You can go between different choices using <nobr>the <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd style=\"color: gray;font-size: 12px;padding: 0 .18rem 0 .1rem;\">◄</kbd></span><span class=\"kbd\"><kbd style=\"color: gray;font-size: 12px; padding: 0 .1rem 0 .18rem;\">►</kbd></span> arrows.)</nobr> Another helpful “trick” in Chat Notebooks is to edit not just your input, but also the output generated from LLM evaluation. When you do an LLM evaluation, the LLM is just given whatever appears above in the Notebook, regardless of where that “came from”. So if the LLM “makes a mistake” you can just fix it yourself, and then the LLM will typically “pick up the fix” when it comes to do later evaluations.</p>\n<p>The default in Chat Notebooks is always to use previous cells as “context” for any chat input you provide. But there’s also a mechanism for having “side chats” that don’t use (or affect) context. Instead of just typing to get a chat cell (in a Chat-Driven Notebook), start the cell with <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span> (&#8220;quote&#8221;) to get a &#8220;side chat&#8221; cell (in a Chat-Enabled Notebook, it&#8217;s <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span> to get a chat cell, and <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span><span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span> to get a side chat cell):</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg15.png' alt='Side chat cell' title='Side chat cell' width='613' height=''/></p>\n<h2 id=\"who-are-you-gonna-talk-to?\">Who Are You Gonna Talk To?</h2>\n<p>When you evaluate a chat cell, you’ll get a response from an LLM. But what determines the “persona” that’ll be used for the LLM—or in general how the LLM is configured? There are multiple levels at which this can be specified—from overall <tt>Preference</tt> settings to Chat Notebook settings to chatblocks to individual chat cells. </p>\n<p>For a chatblock, for example, click the little chat icon to the left and you’ll see a menu of possible personas:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg16.png' alt='Personas menu' title='Personas menu' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>Pick a particular persona and its icon will show up “perched” on the chatblock separator—and then in every chat cell that follows it’ll be that persona that by default responds to you: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg17B.png' alt='Birdnardo query' title='Birdnardo query' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>You can tell it’s that persona responding because its icon will show up as the “label” for the response. (It’ll also appear next to your input if you hover over the chat cell icon).</p>\n<p>We mentioned in passing above that when there are two kinds of Chat Notebooks you can create (e.g. with the <tt>File</tt> > <tt>New</tt> menu): Chat-Enabled Notebooks and Chat-Driven Notebooks. In future versions of the Wolfram Notebook system, Chat-Enabled Notebooks will probably be the standard default for all new notebooks, but for now it’s something you have to explicitly choose. </p>\n<p>So what is a Chat-Enabled Notebook, and how is it different from a Chat-Driven Notebook? The basic point is that a Chat-Enabled Notebook is intended to be used just like Wolfram Notebooks have been used for 35 years—but with additional chat capabilities added. In a Chat-Enabled Notebook the default new cell type (assuming you’re using the default stylesheet) expects Wolfram Language input. To get a chat cell, you explicitly type <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>'</kbd></span> (“quote”) at the beginning of the cell. And when you make that chat cell, it’ll by default be talking to the Code Assistant persona, ready to help you with generating Wolfram Language code.</p>\n<p>A Chat-Driven Notebook is something different: it’s a notebook where chats are the primary content—and by default new cells are always chat cells, and there’s no particular expectation that you’ll be talking about things to do with Wolfram Language. There’s no special persona by default in Chat-Driven Notebook, and instead one’s pretty much just talking to the generic LLM (though there’s some additional prompting about being used in a Notebook, etc.) </p>\n<p>If you want to talk to another persona, though, you can specify that in the menu of personas. There are a few personas listed by default. But there are <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/category/personas\">many more in the Wolfram Prompt Repository</a>. And from <tt>Add & Manage Personas </tt>you can open the personas section of the Prompt Repository: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/category/personas\"><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723prompt-repo-menu-v3.png' alt='Wolfram Prompt Repository personas' title='Wolfram Prompt Repository personas' width='618' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>Then you can go to a persona page, and press the <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>Install</kbd></span> button to install that persona in your session:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/genzspeak-v5.png' alt='GenZSpeak persona' title='GenZSpeak persona' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>Now you’ll be able to select this persona from any chatblock, chat cell, etc. persona menu:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg20.png' alt='GenZSpeak chat' title='GenZSpeak chat' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>The Wolfram Prompt Repository contains a growing selection of curated contributed personas. But the <tt>Install from URL </tt>menu item also lets you install personas that have been independently deployed (for example in the <a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/\">Wolfram Cloud</a>), and are available either publicly or for specific users. (<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/06/prompts-for-work-play-launching-the-wolfram-prompt-repository/#adding-your-own-prompts\">As discussed elsewhere</a>, you can create personas using a Prompt Resource Definition Notebook.)</p>\n<p>Given a named persona—either defined in the Wolfram Prompt Repository, or that you’ve explicitly installed—you can always “direct chat” that persona in a particular chat cell by using <span class=\"promptformatted\">@persona</span>:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg21.png' alt='Chat query about feathers' title='Chat query about feathers' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>When you direct chat a persona in a particular chat cell, that persona gets sent the whole previous history in your current chatblock. But after that persona has responded, subsequent chat cells revert to using the current default persona. Nevertheless, any persona that you direct chat will automatically get installed in the list of personas you can use. Note, by the way, that direct chatting is an independent idea from side chats. Side chats don’t by default affect what persona you’re talking to, but give you a “localized” context, while direct chats affect the persona you’re talking to, but are “flowed into” the global history of the current chatblock.</p>\n<p>Personas let you define all sorts of aspects of how you want an LLM to behave. But ultimately you also have to define the underlying LLM itself. What model should it use? With what “temperature”? etc. At the bottom of the same menus that list personas there’s an <tt>Advanced Settings</tt> item:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg22.png' alt='Advanced Settings menu' title='Advanced Settings menu' width='420' height=''/></p>\n<p>Like personas, these can be set at a chat cell level, chatblock level, notebook level—or globally, through <tt>Preferences</tt> settings. It’s typical to define things like authentication at the <tt>Preferences</tt> level. And ultimately everything about the configuration of an LLM is specified by a symbolic <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMConfiguration.html\"><tt>LLMConfiguration</tt></a> object.</p>\n<p>As we’ll discuss elsewhere, a very important additional feature of full <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMConfiguration.html\"><tt>LLMConfiguration</tt></a> objects is that they can specify “tools” that should be available to an LLM—essentially Wolfram Language APIs that the LLM should be able to send requests to in order to get computational results or computational actions. </p>\n<p>Within a particular Wolfram Language session, you can specify a default LLM configuration by setting the value of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/$LLMEvaluator.html\"><tt>$LLMEvaluator</tt></a>. You can also programmatically create a Chat Notebook with a specified LLM configuration using: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg23_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg23B.png' alt='' title='' width='550' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>(This will make a chat-driven notebook; you can use <tt>\"ChatEnabled\"</tt> to make a chat-enabled notebook.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"applying-functions-in-a-chat-notebook\">Applying Functions in a Chat Notebook</h2>\n<p>As we discussed elsewhere, personas are ultimately just prompts. So when, for example, we say <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Yoda/\">@Yoda</a></span> we’re really just adding the “Yoda prompt” (i.e. <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</a>[\"Yoda\"]</tt>) into a chat evaluation. </p>\n<p>But there are all sorts of prompts that don’t correspond to what we’d normally think of as personas. For example, there are “modifier prompts”, like <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Emojified/\">Emojified</a></span> or <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/SEOOptimize/\">SEOptimize</a></span> or <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/TweetConvert/\">TweetConvert</a></span>, that describe particular output we want to get. And in a Chat Notebook, we can add such modifier prompts just using <span class=\"promptformatted\">#</span><em>prompt</em>:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg24.png' alt='HaikuStyled chat modifier' title='HaikuStyled chat modifier' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>The reason this works is that “under the hood”, a chat evaluation is effectively <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</a>[\"input\"]</tt>, and adding either a persona or a modifier prompt is achieved with <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\">LLMSynthesize</a>[<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\">LLMPrompt</a>[</tt> &#8230; <tt>]]</tt>.</p>\n<p>You can add more than one modifier prompt just by putting in multiple <span class=\"promptformatted\">#</span> items. But what if a modifier prompt has a “parameter”, like in the case of <tt>\"<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\">LLMPrompt</a>[\"Translated\", \"French\"]\"</tt>? Chat Notebooks provide a syntax for that, with each parameter separated by <span class=\"promptformatted\">|</span>, as in <span class=\"promptformatted\">#</span><em>prompt</em><span class=\"promptformatted\">|</span><em>parameter</em>:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg25.png' alt='HaikuStyled and Translated chat modifiers' title='HaikuStyled and Translated chat modifiers' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>Personas and modifiers are both intended to affect the output generated by an LLM in a chat. But the Wolfram Prompt Repository also contains “function prompts”, that are intended to operate on a specific piece of input you give. Function prompts are particularly suitable for programmatic use, as in: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg26_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg26.png' alt='' title='' width='649' height='43'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But it’s also possible to use function prompts in Chat Notebooks. <span class=\"promptformatted\">!</span><em>prompt</em> specifies a function prompt:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg27.png' alt='FormalRephrase chat function prompt' title='FormalRephrase chat function prompt' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>By default, a function prompt in a chat cell takes as its input the text you explicitly give in the chat cell (though it still “sees” previous history in the current chatblock.) But it’s also common to want to put the input in a cell of its own. You can make a function prompt take its input from the previous cell in the notebook by using <span class=\"promptformatted\">!</span><em>prompt</em><span class=\"promptformatted\">^</span>: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg28.png' alt='FormalRephrase example' title='FormalRephrase example' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>But what if you want to feed the complete history (in the current chatblock) to a function prompt? You can do that by using <span class=\"promptformatted\">^^</span> instead of <span class=\"promptformatted\">^</span>:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg29.png' alt='Additional FormalRephrase example' title='Additional FormalRephrase example' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>And, yes, there are a lot of little notations in Chat Notebooks. One gets used to them quickly, but here—for convenience—are all of them collected in a table:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723shortcuts-table-v5.png' alt='Chat Notebooks notation menu' title='Chat Notebook notation menu' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-design-of-chat-notebooks\">The Design of Chat Notebooks</h2>\n<p>One of the great long-term strengths of the Wolfram Language is the <a href=\"https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/\">coherence of its design</a>. And that design coherence extends not only across the language itself, but also to the whole system around the language, including Wolfram Notebooks. So what about Chat Notebooks? As we said above, Chat Notebooks represent a new kind of Notebook—that have new kinds of requirements, and bring new design challenges. But as has happened so many times before, the whole Wolfram Language and Notebook paradigm turns out to be strong and general enough that we’ve been able to design Chat Notebooks so they fit coherently in with the rest of the system. And particularly for those (humans and AIs!) who know the existing system, it may be helpful to discuss some of the precedents and analogies for Chat Notebooks that exist elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>A key feature of Chat Notebooks is the concept of using a different evaluator for certain notebook content—in their case, an LLM evaluator for chat cells. But it turns out that the idea of having different evaluators is something that’s been around ever since we first invented Notebooks 36 years ago. Back in those days a common setup was a Notebook “front end” that could send evaluations either to a kernel running on your local machine, or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/UseASeparateKernelForEvaluation.html\">to remote kernels</a> running on other (perhaps more powerful) machines. (And, yes, there were shades of what we’d now call “<a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/\">the cloud</a>”, though in those days remote computers often had phone connections, etc.)</p>\n<p>Right from the beginning we discussed having evaluators that weren’t directly based on what’s now Wolfram Language (and indeed at a programmatic level we provided plenty of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/CallingExternalPrograms.html\">access to external programs</a>, etc.). But it was only when we <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/about\">released Wolfram|Alpha in 2009</a> that we finally had a compelling reason to think about integrating something other than Wolfram Language evaluation into the core user interface of Notebooks. Because then—through <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\">Wolfram|Alpha</a>’s natural language understanding capabilities—we had a way to specify Wolfram Language computations using something other than Wolfram Language: ordinary natural language. </p>\n<p>So this led us to introduce Wolfram|Alpha cells—where evaluation first interprets natural language you type, then does the Wolfram Language computation it specifies. You get a <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/natural-language-input/\">Wolfram|Alpha cell by pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>=</kbd></span></a> when you create the cell (we also introduced the <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/real-world-entities/\">inline <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>control</kbd><kbd>=</kbd></span> mechanism</a>); then <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd></span> does the evaluation:</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: 3px\" src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723Aimg31.png' alt='Wolfram|Alpha cell' title='Wolfram|Alpha cell' width='407' height=''/></p>\n<p>In 2017 (with <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/language/v11.2/\">Version 11.2</a>) the notion of access to “other evaluators” from notebooks took another step—with the introduction of external evaluation cells:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/python_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723python-print-hello.png' alt='External evaluation cell' title='External evaluation cell' width='620' height=''/></div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And with this also came the notion of a menu of “possible evaluators”—a precursor to the personas menu of Chat Notebooks:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723python-menu.png' alt='External software menu' title='External software menu' width='233' height=''/></p>\n<p>Then in 2019 came the introduction of <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/09/the-ease-of-wolframalpha-the-power-of-mathematica-introducing-wolframalpha-notebook-edition/\">Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition,</a> with its whole framework around natural language “Wolfram|Alpha-style” input cells:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw060723notebook-edition.png' alt='Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition input cells' title='Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition input cells' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>And in a sense this was the most direct precursor to Chat Notebooks. But now instead of having “free-form input” cells going to Wolfram|Alpha, we have chat cells going to an LLM. </p>\n<p>At a programmatic level, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ChatEvaluate.html\"><tt>ChatEvaluate</tt></a> (and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</tt></a>) are in many ways not so different from <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudEvaluate.html\">CloudEvaluate</a></tt>, <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RemoteEvaluate.html\">RemoteEvaluate</a></tt> or <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ParallelEvaluate.html\">ParallelEvaluate</a></tt>. But what’s new is the Notebook interface aspect—which is what we’ve invented Chat Notebooks for. In things like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ExternalEvaluate.html\">ExternalEvaluate</a></tt> and <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ParallelEvaluate.html\">ParallelEvaluate</a></tt> there’s a state maintained within the evaluator. But Wolfram|Alpha, for example, is typically stateless. So in <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-alpha-notebook-edition/\">Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition</a> “state” is determined from previous cells in the notebook—which is essentially the same mechanism used in Chat Notebooks.</p>\n<p>But one of the new things in Chat Notebooks is that not only are previous cells that are somehow identified as “input” used to determine the “state”, but other cells (like text cells) are used as well. And, yes, ever since <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v3/\">Version 3</a> in 1996, there’ve been notebook programming constructs that have been able to process arbitrary notebook content. But Chat Notebooks are the first time “non-input” has been used in “evaluation”.</p>\n<p>Most of the defining features of Notebooks—like cells, cell groups, evaluation behavior, and so on—have been there ever since the beginning, back in 1988. But gradually over the years, we’ve progressively polished the concepts of Notebooks—introducing ideas like reverse-closed cells, template boxes, input ligatures, etc. And what’s remarkable to see now is how Chat Notebooks build on all these concepts.</p>\n<p>You can cut, copy, paste chat cells just like any other kinds of cells. You can close chat outputs, or reverse close chat inputs. It’s all the same as in the Notebook paradigm we’ve had for so long. But there are new ideas, like alternate outputs, chatblocks, etc. And no doubt over the months and years to come—as we see just how Chat Notebooks are used—we’ll invent ways to extend and polish the Chat Notebook experience. But as of now, it’s exciting to see how we’ve been able to take the paradigm that we invented more than 35 years ago and use it to deliver such a rich and powerful interface to those most modern of things: LLMs.</p>\n",

And one might wonder why, if one has a description for a prompt, one can’t just use that description directly, rather than having to store a prewritten prompt. Well, sometimes just using the description will indeed work fine. But often it won’t. Sometimes that’s because one needs to clarify further what one wants. Sometimes it’s because there are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/#how-it-works%E2%80%94and-wrangling-the-ai'>not-immediately-obvious corner cases to cover</a>. And sometimes there’s just a certain amount of “LLM wrangling” to be done. And this all adds up to the need to do at least some “prompt engineering” on almost any prompt.</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/YesNo/'>YesNo</a></span> modifier prompt from above is currently fairly simple:</p>\n<p></p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg12.png\" alt='' title='' width='550' height='94' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg12a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<p>But it’s still already complicated enough one that doesn’t want to have to repeat it every time one’s trying to force a yes/no answer. And no doubt there’ll be subsequent versions of this prompt (that, yes, will have <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/WolframResourceSystem.html'>versioning handled seamlessly</a> by the Prompt Repository) that will get increasingly elaborate, as more cases show up, and more prompt engineering gets done to address them. </p>\n<p>Many of the prompts in the Prompt Repository even now are considerably more complicated. Some contain typical “general prompt engineering”, but others contain for example special information that the LLM doesn’t intrinsically know, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/#functions-from-examples'>detailed examples</a> that home in on what one wants to have happen.</p>\n<p>In the simplest cases, prompts (like the <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/YesNo/'>YesNo</a></span> one above) are just plain pieces of text. But often they contain parameters, or have additional computational or other content. And a key feature of the Wolfram Prompt Repository is that it can handle this ancillary material, ultimately by representing everything using <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/symbolic-expressions/'>Wolfram Language symbolic expressions</a>.</p>\n<p>As we discussed in connection with <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMFunction</a></tt>, etc. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>in another post</a>, the core “textual” part of a prompt is represented by a symbolic <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringTemplate.html'>StringTemplate</a></tt> that immediately allows positional or named parameters. Then there can be an interpreter that applies a Wolfram Language <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Interpreter.html'>Interpreter</a></tt> function to the raw textual output of the LLM—transforming it from plain text to a computable symbolic expression. More sophisticatedly, there can also be specifications of tools that the LLM can call (represented symbolically as <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMTool.html\"><tt>LLMTool</tt></a> constructs), as well as other information about the required LLM configuration (represented by an <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMConfiguration</a></tt> object). But the key point is that all of this is automatically “packaged up” in the Prompt Repository. </p>\n<p>But what actually is the Wolfram Prompt Repository? Well, ultimately it’s just part of the general <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/'>Wolfram Resource System</a>—the same one that’s used for the <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/'>Wolfram Function Repository</a>, <a href='https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Data Repository</a>, <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/'>Wolfram Neural Net Repository</a>, <a href='https://notebookarchive.org/'>Wolfram Notebook Archive</a>, and many other things. </p>\n<p>And so, for example, the <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Yoda/'>&quot;Yoda&quot;</a></span> prompt is in the end represented by a symbolic <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ResourceObject.html'>ResourceObject</a></tt> that’s part of the Resource System:</p>\n<p></p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg13.png\" alt='' title='' width='550' height='101' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg13a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<p>Open up the display of this resource object, and we’ll immediately see various pieces of metadata (and a link to documentation), as well as the ultimate canonical UUID of the object:</p>\n<p></p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw053123promptrepoimg14b.png\" alt='' title='' width='603' height='176' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg14a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<p>Everything that needs to use the prompt—Chat Notebooks, <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMPrompt</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMResourceFunction</a></tt>, etc.—just works by accessing appropriate parts of the <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ResourceObject.html'>ResourceObject</a></tt>, so that for example the “hero image” (used for the persona icon) is retrieved like this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg15.png\" alt='' title='' width='622' height='137' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg15a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<p>There’s a lot of important infrastructure that “comes for free” from the general Wolfram Resource System—like efficient caching, automatic updating, documentation access, etc. And things like <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMPrompt</a></tt> follow the exact same approach as things like <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NetModel.html'>NetModel</a></tt> in being able to immediately reference entries in a repository.</p>\n<h2 id='what&rsquo;s-in-the-prompt-repository-so-far'>What&rsquo;s in the Prompt Repository So Far</h2>\n<p>We haven’t been working on the Wolfram Prompt Repository for very long, and we’re just opening it up for outside contributions now.

Others make use of common-sense knowledge. And some are just fun. But, yes, writing good prompts is hard—and what’s in the Prompt Repository will gradually improve. And when there are bugs, they can be pretty weird. Like <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/PunAbout/'>PunAbout</a></span> is supposed to generate a pun about some topic, but here it decides to protest and say it must generate three:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg39.png\" alt='Parrot' title='Parrot' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p>The final category of prompts currently in the Prompt Repository are <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/category/modifier-prompts'>modifier prompts</a>, intended as a way to modify the output generated by the LLM. Sometimes modifier prompts can be essentially textual:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg40.png\" alt='How many legs does a spider have?' title='How many legs does a spider have?' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg41.png\" alt='How many legs does a spider have?' title='How many legs does a spider have?' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg42.png\" alt='How many legs does a spider have?' title='How many legs does a spider have?' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p>But often modifier prompts are intended to create output in a particular form, suitable, for example, for interpretation by an interpreter in <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMFunction</a></tt>, etc.:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg43.png\" alt='How many legs does a spider have?' title='How many legs does a spider have?' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg44.png\" alt='Number of legs for the 5 common invertebrates' title='Number of legs for the 5 common invertebrates' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg45.png\" alt='Are AIs good?' title='Are AIs good?' width='605' height='' /></p>\n<p>So far the modifier prompts in the Prompt Repository are fairly simple. But once there are prompts that make use of tools (i.e. call back into Wolfram Language during the generation process) we can expect modifier prompts that are much more sophisticated, useful and robust.</p>\n<h2 id='adding-your-own-prompts'>Adding Your Own Prompts</h2>\n<p>The Wolfram Prompt Repository is set up to be a curated public collection of prompts where it’s easy for anyone to submit a new prompt. But—as we’ll explain—you can also use the framework of the Prompt Repository to store “private” prompts, or share them with specific groups.</p>\n<p>So how do you define a new prompt in the Prompt Repository framework? The easiest way is to fill out a Prompt Resource Definition Notebook:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg46.png\" alt='Prompt Resource Definition Notebook' title='Prompt Resource Definition Notebook' width='528' height='auto' /></p>\n<p>You can get this notebook <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/Unnamed-Prompt.nb'>here</a>, or from the <tt>Submit a Prompt</tt> button at the top of the Prompt Repository website, or by evaluating <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CreateNotebook.html\"><tt>CreateNotebook</a>[\"PromptResource\"]</tt>.</p>\n<p>The setup is directly analogous to the ones for the <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository'>Wolfram Function Repository</a>, <a href='https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/'>Wolfram Data Repository</a>, <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository'>Wolfram Neural Net Repository</a>, etc. And once you’ve filled out the Definition Notebook, you’ve got various choices:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg47.png\" alt='Definition Notebook deployment options' title='Definition Notebook deployment options' width='272' height='' /></p>\n<p><tt>Submit to Repository</tt> sends the prompt to our curation team for our official Wolfram Prompt Repository; <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Deploy.html\"><tt>Deploy</tt></a> deploys it for your own use, and for people (or AIs) you choose to share it with. If you’re using the prompt “privately”, you can refer to it using its URI or other identifier (if you use <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ResourceRegister.html'>ResourceRegister</a></tt> you can also just refer to it by the name you give it). </p>\n<p>OK, so what do you need to specify in the Definition Notebook? The most important part is the actual prompt itself. And quite often the prompt may just be a (carefully crafted) piece of plain text. But ultimately—<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/#how-it-all-works\">as discussed elsewhere</a>—a prompt is a symbolic template, that can include parameters. And you can insert parameters into a prompt using “template slots”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw053123promptrepoimg48.png\" alt='Template slots' title='Template slots' width='272' height='' /></p>\n<p>(<tt>Template Expression</tt> lets you insert Wolfram Language code that will be evaluated when the prompt is applied—so you can for example include the current time with <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Now.html'>Now</a></tt>.)</p>\n<p>In simple cases, all you’ll need to specify is the “pure prompt”. But in more sophisticated cases you’ll also want to specify some “outside the prompt” information—and there are some sections for this in the Definition Notebook: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw053123promptrepoimg49a.png\" alt='Definition Notebook sections' title='Definition Notebook sections' width='480' height='' /></p>\n<p>Chat-Related Features is most relevant for personas:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw053123promptrepoimg50a.png\" alt='Chat features' title='Chat features' width='480' height='' /></p>\n<p>You can give an icon that will appear in Chat Notebooks for that persona. And then you can give Wolfram Language functions which are to be applied to the contents of each chat cell before it is fed to the LLM (“Cell Processing Function”), and to the output generated by the LLM (“Cell Post Evaluation Function”). These functions are useful in transforming material to and from the plain text consumed by the LLM, and supporting richer display and computational structures.</p>\n<p>Programmatic Features is particularly relevant for function prompts, and for the way prompts are used in <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMResourceFunction</a></tt> etc.:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw053123promptrepoimg51c.png\" alt='Programmatic Features' title='Programmatic Features' width='480' height='' /></p>\n<p>There’s “function-oriented documentation” (analogous to what’s used for built-in Wolfram Language functions, or for functions in the Wolfram Function Repository). And then there’s the Output Interpreter: a function to be applied to the textual output of the LLM, to generate the actual expression that will be returned by <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMResourceFunction</a></tt>, or for formatting in a Chat Notebook.</p>\n<p>What about the LLM Configuration section? </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/06/sw053123promptrepoimg52a.png\" alt='LLM configuration options' title='LLM configuration options' width='480' height='' /></p>\n<p>The first thing it does is to define tools that can be requested by the LLM when this prompt is used. We’ll discuss tools in another post. But as we’ve mentioned several times, they’re a way of having the LLM call Wolfram Language to get particular computational results that are then returned to the LLM. The other part of the LLM Configuration section is a more general <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMConfiguration</a></tt> specification, which can include “temperature” settings, the requirement of using a particular underlying model (e.g. GPT-4), etc.</p>\n<p>What else is in the Definition Notebook? There are two main documentation sections: one for Chat Examples, and one for Programmatic Examples. Then there are various kinds of metadata. </p>\n<p>Of course, at the very top of the Definition Notebook there’s another very important thing: the name you specify for the prompt. And here—with the initial prompts we’ve put into the Prompt Repository—we’ve started to develop some conventions. Following typical Wolfram Language usage we’re “camel-casing” names (so it’s <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/TitleSuggest/'>&quot;TitleSuggest&quot;</a></span> not <span class=\"promptformatted\">&quot;title suggest&quot;</span>). Then we try to use different grammatical forms for different kinds of prompts. For personas we try to use noun phrases (like <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Cheerleader/'>&quot;Cheerleader&quot;</a></span> or <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/SommelierBot/'>&quot;SommelierBot&quot;</a></span>). For functions we usually try to use verb phrases (like <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Summarize/'>&quot;Summarize&quot;</a></span> or <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/HypeUp/'>&quot;HypeUp&quot;</a></span>). And for modifiers we try to use past-tense verb forms (like <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Translated/'>&quot;Translated&quot;</a></span> or <span class=\"promptformatted\"><a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/HaikuStyled/'>&quot;HaikuStyled&quot;</a></span>). </p>\n<p>The overall goal with prompt names—like with ordinary Wolfram Language function names—is to provide a summary of what the prompt does, in a form that’s short enough that it appears a bit like a word in computational language input, chats, etc.</p>\n<p>OK, so let’s say you’ve filled out a Definition Notebook, and you <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Deploy.html\"><tt>Deploy</tt></a> it. You’ll get a webpage that includes the documentation you’ve given—and looks pretty much like any of the pages in the Wolfram Prompt Repository. And now if you want to use the prompt, you can just click the appropriate place on the webpage, and you’ll get a copyable version that you can immediately paste into an input cell, a chat cell, etc. (Within a Chat Notebook there’s an even more direct mechanism: in the chat icon menu, go to <tt>Add & Manage Personas</tt>, and when you browse the Prompt Repository, there’ll be an <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>Install</kbd></span> button that will automatically install a persona.)</p>\n<h2 id='a-language-of-prompts'>A Language of Prompts</h2>\n<p>LLMs fundamentally deal with natural language of the kind we humans normally use. But when we set up a named prompt we’re in a sense defining a “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-concept-of-concepts'>higher-level word</a>” that can be used to “communicate” with the LLM—at the least with the kind of “harness” that <tt><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/05/the-new-world-of-llm-functions-integrating-llm-technology-into-the-wolfram-language/'>LLMFunction</a></tt>, Chat Notebooks, etc. provide. And we can then imagine in effect “talking in prompts” and for example building up more and more levels of prompts.</p>\n<p>Of course, we already have a major example of something that at least in outline is similar: the way in which over the past few decades we’ve been able to progressively <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>construct a whole tower of functionality</a> from the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/'>built-in functions in the Wolfram Language</a>. There’s an important difference, however: in defining built-in functions we’re always working on “solid ground”, with precise (carefully designed) computational specifications for what we’re doing. In setting up prompts for an LLM, try as we might to “write the prompts well” we’re in a sense ultimately “at the mercy of the LLM” and how it chooses to handle things.</p>\n<p>It feels in some ways like the difference between dealing with engineering systems and with human organizations. In both cases one can set up plans and procedures for what should happen. In the engineering case, however, one can expect that (at least at the level of individual operations) the system will do exactly as one says. In the human case—well, all kinds of things can happen. That is not to say that amazing results can’t be achieved by human organizations; history clearly shows they can.</p>\n<p>But—as someone who’s managed <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>(human) organizations</a> now for more than four decades—I think I can say the “rhythm” and practices of dealing with human organizations differ in significant ways from those for technological ones. There’s still a definite pattern of what to do, but it’s different, with a different way of going back and forth to get results, different approaches to “debugging”, etc. </p>\n<p>How will it work with prompts? It’s something we still need to get used to. But for me there’s immediately another useful “comparable”. Back in the early 2000s we’d had a decade or two of experience in developing what’s now Wolfram Language, with its precise formal specifications, carefully designed with consistency in mind. But then we started working on <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>—where now we wanted a system that would just deal with whatever input someone might provide. At first it was jarring. How could we develop any kind of manageable system based on boatloads of potentially incompatible heuristics? It took a little while, but eventually we realized that when everything is a heuristic there’s a certain pattern and structure to that. And over time the development we do has become progressively more systematic.</p>\n<p>And so, I expect, it will be with prompts. In the Wolfram Prompt Repository today, we have a collection of prompts that cover a variety of areas, but are almost all “first level”, in the sense that they depend only on the base LLM, and not on other prompts. But over time I expect there’ll be whole hierarchies of prompts that develop (including metaprompts for building prompts, etc. ) And indeed I won’t be surprised if in this way all sorts of “repeatable lumps of functionality” are found, that actually can be implemented in a direct computational way, without depending on LLMs. (And, yes, this may well go through the kind of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#semantic-grammar-and-the-power-of-computational-language'>&#8220;semantic grammar&#8221; structure that I&#8217;ve discussed elsewhere</a>.)</p>\n<p>But as of now, we’re still just at the point of first launching the Wolfram Prompt Repository, and beginning the process of understanding the range of things—both useful and fun—that can be achieved with prompts. But it’s already clear that there’s going to be a very interesting world of prompts—and a progressive development of “prompt language” that in some ways will probably parallel (though at a considerably faster rate) the historical development of ordinary human languages. </p>\n<p>It’s going to be a community effort—just as it is with ordinary human languages—to explore and build out “prompt language”. And now that it’s launched, I’m excited to see how people will use our Prompt Repository, and just what remarkable things end up being possible through it.</p>\n",

But it’s often convenient to use—or at least include—“pre-written” prompts, either ones that you’ve created and stored before, or ones that come from our new <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/\">Wolfram Prompt Repository</a>:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223WPR.png' alt='Wolfram Prompt Repository' title='Wolfram Prompt Repository' width='364' height=''/></p>\n<p>Other posts in this series will talk in more detail about the Wolfram Prompt Repository—and about how it can be used in things like Chat Notebooks. But here we’re going to talk about how it can be used “programmatically” for LLM functions. </p>\n<p>The first approach is to use what we call “function prompts”—that are essentially pre-built <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> objects. There’s a whole section of function prompts in the Prompt Repository. As one example, let’s consider the <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Emojify/\">Emojify</a>\"</tt> function prompt. Here’s its page in the Prompt Repository:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223emojifyX.png' alt='Emojify page' title='Emojify page' width='506' height=''/></p>\n<p>You can take any function prompt and apply it to specific text using <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMResourceFunction.html\"><tt>LLMResourceFunction</tt></a>. Here’s what happens with the <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/Emojify/\">Emojify</a>\"</tt> prompt:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg61_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg61.png' alt='' title='' width='606' height='55'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And if you look at the pure result from <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMResourceFunction.html\"><tt>LLMResourceFunction</tt></a>, we can see that it’s just an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>—whose content was obtained from the Prompt Repository: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg62_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg62B.png' alt='' title='' width='276' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here’s another example: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg63_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg63.png' alt='' title='' width='670' height='46'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And here we’re applying two different (but, in this particular case, approximately inverse) LLM functions from the Prompt Repository: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg64_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg64.png' alt='' title='' width='391' height='94'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMResourceFunction.html\"><tt>LLMResourceFunction</tt></a> can take more than one argument:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg65A_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/w052223Aimg65B.png' alt='' title='' width='532' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Something that we see here is that <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMResourceFunction.html\"><tt>LLMResourceFunction</tt></a> can have an interpreter built into it—so that instead of just returning a string, it can return a computable (<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/interpreter/HeldExpression.html\">here held</a>) Wolfram Language expression. So, for example, the <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/MovieSuggest\">MovieSuggest</a>\"</tt> prompt in the Prompt Repository is defined to include an interpreter that gives <tt>\"<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/Movie.html\">Movie</a>\"</tt> entities</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Ximg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Ximg1.png' alt='' title='' width='624' height='100'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>from which we can do further computations, like:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Ximg2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Ximg2.png' alt='' title='' width='609' height='330'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Besides “function prompts”, another large section of the Prompt Repository is devoted to “persona” prompts. These are primarily intended for chats (“talk to a particular persona”), but they can also be used “programmatically” through <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMResourceFunction.html\"><tt>LLMResourceFunction</tt></a> to ask for a single response “from the persona” to a particular input: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg66_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg66.png' alt='' title='' width='596' height='69'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Beyond function and persona prompts, there’s a third major kind of prompt—that we call a “modifier prompt”—that’s intended to modify output from the LLM. An example of a modifier prompt is <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/ELI5/\">ELI5</a>\"</tt> (“Explain Like I’m 5”). To “pull in” such a modifier prompt from the Prompt Repository, we use the general function <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a>. </p>\n<p>Say we’ve got an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> set up: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg67_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg67.png' alt='' title='' width='490' height='70'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>To modify it with <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/ELI5/\">ELI5</a>\"</tt>, we just insert <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a>[\"ELI5\"]</tt> into the “body” of the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg68_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg68.png' alt='' title='' width='597' height='70'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>You can include multiple modifier prompts; some modifier prompts (like <tt>\"Translated\"</tt>) are set up to “take parameters” (here, the language to have the output translated into):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg69_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg69.png' alt='' title='' width='643' height='94'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We’ll talk later in more detail about how this works. But the basic idea is just that <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a> retrieves representations of prompts from the Prompt Repository: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg70_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/w052223Aimg70B.png' alt='' title='' width='300' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>An important kind of modifier prompts are ones intended to force the output from an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> to have a particular structure, that for example can readily be interpreted in computable Wolfram Language form. Here we’re using the <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/YesNo/\">YesNo</a>\"</tt> prompt, that forces a yes-or-no answer: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg71_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg71.png' alt='' title='' width='519' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>By the way, you can also use the <tt>\"<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/resources/YesNo/\">YesNo</a>\"</tt> prompt as a function prompt:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg72_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg72.png' alt='' title='' width='425' height='43'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And in general, as we’ll discuss later, there’s actually lots of crossover between what we’ve called “function”, “persona” and “modifier” prompts.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Prompt Repository is intended to have lots of good, useful prompts in it, and to provide a curated, public collection of prompts. But sometimes you’ll want your own, custom prompts—that you might want to share, either publicly or with a specific group. And—just as with the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository\">Wolfram Function Repository</a>, <a href=\"https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wolfram Data Repository</a>, etc.—you can use exactly the same underlying machinery as the Wolfram Prompt Repository to do this. </p>\n<p>Start by bringing up a new Prompt Resource Definition notebook (use the <span class=\"computer-voice\">New</span> > <span class=\"computer-voice\">Repository Item</span> > <span class=\"computer-voice\">Prompt Repository Item</span> menu item). Then fill this out with whatever definition you want to give:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/wolfify.png' alt='Wolfify definition notebook' title='Wolfify definition notebook' width='600' height=''/></p>\n<p>There’s a button to submit your definition to the public Prompt Repository. But instead of using this, you can go to the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Deploy</span> menu, which lets you deploy your definition either locally, or publicly or privately <a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/\">to the cloud</a> (or just within the current Wolfram Language session).</p>\n<p>Let’s say you deploy publicly to the cloud. Then you’ll get a “documentation” webpage:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/wolfdoc.png' alt='Wolfify documentatin page' title='Wolfify documentation page' width='485' height=''/></p>\n<p>And to use your prompt, anyone just has to give its URL:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg75B_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg75A.png' alt='' title='' width='578' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a> gives you a representation of the prompt you wrote:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg76C_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg76A-1.png' alt='' title='' width='630' height=''> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg76B.png' alt='' title='' width='300' height=''></div>\n</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-all-works\">How It All Works</h2>\n<p>We’ve seen how <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a>, etc. can be used. But now let’s talk about how they work at an underlying Wolfram Language level. Like everything else in Wolfram Language, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a>, etc. are symbolic objects. Here’s a simple <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223upwardimg1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223upwardimg1.png' alt='' title='' width='317' height='84'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And when we apply the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, we’re taking this symbolic object and supplying some argument to it—and then it’s evaluating to give a result:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223upwardimg2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223upwardimg2.png' alt='' title='' width='441' height='81'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what’s actually going on underneath? There are two basic steps. First a piece of text is created. And then this text is fed to the LLM—which generates the result which is returned. So how is the text created? Essentially it’s through the application of a standard <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringTemplate.html\">Wolfram Language string template</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg80_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg80.png' alt='' title='' width='395' height='46'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And then comes the “big step”—processing this text through the LLM. And this is achieved by <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</tt></a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg81_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg81.png' alt='' title='' width='339' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</tt></a> is the function that ultimately underlies all our LLM functionality. Its goal is to do <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#its-just-adding-one-word-at-a-time\">what LLMs fundamentally do</a>—which is to take a piece of text and “continue it in a reasonable way”. Here’s a very simple example:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg82_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg82.png' alt='' title='' width='306' height='43'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>When you do something like ask a question, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</tt></a> will “continue” by answering it, potentially with another sentence:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg83_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg83.png' alt='' title='' width='433' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There are lots of details, that we’ll talk about later. But we’ve now seen the basic setup, at least for generating textual output. But another important piece is being able to “interpret” the textual output as a computable Wolfram Language expression that can immediately plug into all the other capabilities of the Wolfram Language. The way this interpretation is specified is again very straightforward: you just give a second argument to the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>.</p>\n<p>If that second argument is, say, <tt>f</tt>, the result you’ll get just has <tt>f</tt> applied to the textual output:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg84_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg84.png' alt='' title='' width='390' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what’s actually going on is that <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Interpreter.html\">Interpreter</a></tt><tt>[f]1</tt> is being applied, which for the symbol <tt>f</tt> happens to be the same as just applying <tt>f</tt>.

The ultimate goal of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a> is to retrieve pre-written prompts and then derive from them text that can be “spliced into” <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</tt></a>. Sometimes prompts (say in the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/\">Wolfram Prompt Repository</a>) could just be pure pieces of text. But sometimes they need parameters. And for consistency, all prompts from the Prompt Repository are given in the form of template objects. </p>\n<p>If there are no parameters, here’s how you can extract the pure text form of an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg99_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg99.png' alt='' title='' width='397' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMSynthesize.html\"><tt>LLMSynthesize</tt></a> effectively automatically resolves any <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a> templates given in it, so for example this immediately works:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg100_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg100.png' alt='' title='' width='495' height='70'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And it’s this same mechanism that lets one include <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a> objects inside <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, etc. </p>\n<p>By the way, there’s always a “core template” in any <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>.

When the prompts don’t have parameters this is straightforward, and you can just give all the prompts you want directly in a list.</p>\n<p>But when prompts have parameters, things are a bit more complicated. Here’s an example that uses two prompts, one of which has a parameter:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg103_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg103.png' alt='' title='' width='588' height='115'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And the point is that by using <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TemplateSlot.html\">TemplateSlot</a></tt> we can “pull in” arguments from the “outer” <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, and use them to explicitly fill arguments we need for an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMPrompt.html\"><tt>LLMPrompt</tt></a> inside. And of course it’s very convenient that we can use general Wolfram Language <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TemplateObject.html\">TemplateObject</a></tt> technology to specify all this “plumbing”.</p>\n<p>But there’s actually even more that <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TemplateObject.html\">TemplateObject</a></tt> technology gives us. One issue is that in order to feed something to an LLM (or, at least, a present-day one), it has to be an ordinary text string. Yet it’s often convenient to give general Wolfram Language expression arguments to LLM functions. Inside <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringTemplate.html\">StringTemplate</a></tt> (and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>) there’s an <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InsertionFunction.html\">InsertionFunction</a></tt> option, that specifies how things are supposed to be converted for insertion—and the default for that is to use the function <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TextString.html\">TextString</a></tt>, which tries to make “reasonable textual versions” of any Wolfram Language expression.</p>\n<p>So this is why something like this can work:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg104_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg104.png' alt='' title='' width='373' height='46'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s because applying the <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/StringTemplate.html\">StringTemplate</a></tt> turns the <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223pinkbox.png' alt='' title='' width='15' height=''> expression into a string (in this case <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RGBColor.html\">RGBColor</a>[</tt>&#8230;<tt>]</tt>) that the LLM can process.</p>\n<p>It’s always possible to specify your own <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InsertionFunction.html\">InsertionFunction</a></tt>.

But what about the LLM inside?  What specifies how it’s set up? </p>\n<p>The key is to think of it as being what we’re calling an “LLM evaluator”. In using Wolfram Language the default is to evaluate expressions (like 2 + 2) using the standard Wolfram Language evaluator. Of course, there are functions like <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudEvaluate.html\">CloudEvaluate</a></tt> and <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RemoteEvaluate.html\">RemoteEvaluate</a></tt>—as well as <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ExternalEvaluate.html\">ExternalEvaluate</a></tt>—that do evaluation”elsewhere”. And it’s basically the same story for LLM functions.

One is <tt>\"StopTokens\"</tt>—a list of tokens which, if encountered, should cause the LLM to stop generating output, here at the “ff” in the word “giraffe”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg109_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg109.png' alt='' title='' width='411' height='70'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p><tt>LLMConfiguration</tt> lets you specify a full “symbolic LLM configuration” that precisely defines what LLM, with what configuration, you want to use:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg110_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg110.png' alt='' title='' width='594' height='103'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s one particularly important further aspect of LLM configurations to discuss, and that’s the question of how much randomness the LLM should use. The most common way to specify this is through the <tt>\"Temperature\"</tt> parameter. Recall that at each step in its operation an <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#its-just-adding-one-word-at-a-time\">LLM generates a list of probabilities</a> for what the next token in its output should be. The <tt>\"Temperature\"</tt> parameter <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#its-just-adding-one-word-at-a-time\">determines how to actually generate a token</a> based on those probabilities.</p>\n<p>Temperature 0 always “deterministically” picks the token that is deemed most probable. Nonzero temperatures explicitly introduce randomness. Temperature 1 picks tokens according to the actual probabilities generated by the LLM. Lower temperatures favor words that were assigned higher probabilities; higher temperature “reach further” to words with lower probabilities.</p>\n<p>Lower temperatures generally lead to “flatter” but more reliable and reproducible results; higher temperatures introduce more “liveliness”, but also more of a tendency to “go off track”.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens at zero temperature (yes, a very “flat” joke):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg111_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg111.png' alt='' title='' width='579' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now here’s temperature 1:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg112_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg112.png' alt='' title='' width='579' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There’s always randomness at temperature 1, so the result will typically be different every time:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg113_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg113.png' alt='' title='' width='579' height='66'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>If you increase the temperature too much, the LLM will start “melting down”, and producing nonsense:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg114_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg114.png' alt='' title='' width='592' height='66'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At temperature 2 (the current maximum) the LLM has effectively gone completely bonkers, dredging up all sorts of weird stuff from its “subconscious”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg115_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/llmsynthesize.png' alt='' title='' width='620' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>In this case, it goes on for a long time, but finally hits a stop token and stops.

It’s set up to be by default as “deterministic” and repeatable as possible. But for subtle and detailed reasons it can’t be perfectly deterministic and repeatable, at least with typical current implementations of LLM neural nets. </p>\n<p>The basic issue is that current neural nets <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#neural-nets\">operate with approximate real numbers</a>, and occasionally roundoff in those numbers can be critical to “decisions” made by the neural net (typically because the application of the activation function for the neural net can lead to a bifurcation between results from numerically nearby values). And so, for example, if different <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> evaluations happen on servers with different hardware and different roundoff characteristics, the results can be different.</p>\n<p>But actually the results can be different even if exactly the same hardware is used. Here’s the typical (subtle) reason why. In a neural net evaluation there are lots of arithmetic operations that can in principle be done in parallel. And if one’s using a GPU there’ll be units that can in principle do certain numbers of these operations in parallel. But there’s typically elaborate <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/11.8.0/floating-point/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real-time optimization of what operation should be done when</a>—that depends, for example, on the detailed state and history of the GPU. But so what? Well, it means that in different cases operations can end up being done in different orders. So, for example, one time one might end up computing (<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>) + <em>c</em>, while another time one might compute <em>a</em> + (<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>).</p>\n<p>Now, of course, in standard mathematics, for ordinary numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, these forms are always identically equal. But with limited-precision floating-point numbers on a computer, they sometimes aren’t, as in a case like this:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg119_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg119.png' alt='' title='' width='313' height='46'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And the presence of even this tiny deviation from associativity (normally only in the least significant bit) means that the order of operations in a GPU can in principle matter. At the level of individual operations, it’s a small effect. But if one “hits a bifurcation” in the neural net, there can end up being a cascade of consequences, leading eventually to a different token being produced, and a whole different “path of text” being generated—all even though one is “operating at zero temperature”. </p>\n<p>Most of the time this is quite a nuisance—because it means you can’t count on an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> doing the same thing every time it’s run. But sometimes you’ll specifically want an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> to be a bit random and “creative”—which is something you can force by explicitly telling it to use a nonzero temperature. So, for example, with default zero temperature, this will usually give the same result each time:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg120_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg120.png' alt='' title='' width='556' height='46'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg121_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg121.png' alt='' title='' width='556' height='46'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But with temperature 1, you’ll get different results each time (though the LLM really seems to like Sally!):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg122_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg122.png' alt='' title='' width='484' height='94'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg123_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg123.png' alt='' title='' width='459' height='70'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"ai-wrangling-and-the-art-of-prompts\">AI Wrangling and the Art of Prompts</h2>\n<p>There’s a certain systematic and predictable character to writing typical Wolfram Language. You use functions that have been carefully designed (with <a href=\"https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great effort</a>, over decades, I might add) to do particular, well-specified and documented things. But setting up prompts for LLMs is a much less systematic and predictable activity. It’s more of an art—where one’s effectively probing the “alien mind” of the LLM, and trying to “wrangle” it to do what one wants.</p>\n<p>I’ve come to believe, though, that the #1 thing about good prompts is that they have to be based on good expository writing. The same things that make a piece of writing understandable to a human will make it “understandable” to the LLM. And in a sense that’s not surprising, given that the LLM is trained in a very “human way”—from human-written text. </p>\n<p>Consider the following prompt:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg124_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg124.png' alt='' title='' width='374' height='45'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>In this case it does what one probably wants.

But it saw lots of text about colors and fashions, that mentioned particular years. If it had collected numerical data, it could have used standard mathematical and statistical methods to combine it, look for “favorites”, etc. But instead it’s dealing with linguistic data, and the point is that the way an LLM works, it’s in effect able to systematically handle and combine that data, and derive “aggregated conclusions” from it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"symbolic-chats\">Symbolic Chats</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, etc. the underlying LLM is basically always called just once.

And along with the release of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a>, etc. we’re also releasing a symbolic framework for “LLM chats”.</p>\n<p>A chat is always represented by a chat object. This creates an “empty chat”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg135_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg135C.png' alt='' title='' width='195' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we can take the empty chat, and “make our first statement”, to which the LLM will respond:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg136_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg136.png' alt='' title='' width='545' height='148'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We can add another back and forth:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg137_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw052223Aimg137.png' alt='' title='' width='678' height='313'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At each stage the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ChatObject.html\"><tt>ChatObject</tt></a> represents the complete state of the chat so far.

In the future, we’ll discuss how Wolfram Language tools can be called from within an LLM—opening up very powerful multi-pass automatic “collaboration” between LLMs and Wolfram Language. We’ll also in the future discuss how a new kind of Wolfram Notebooks can be used to provide a uniquely effective interactive interface to LLMs. And there’ll be much more too. Indeed, almost every day we’re uncovering remarkable new possibilities. </p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LLMFunction.html\"><tt>LLMFunction</tt></a> and the other things we’ve discussed here form an important foundation for what we can now do. Extending what we’ve done over the past decade or more in machine learning, they form a key bridge between the symbolic world that’s at the core of the Wolfram Language, and the “statistical AI” world of LLMs. It’s a uniquely powerful combination that we can expect to represent an anchor piece of what can now be done.</p>\n",

One can think of this as adding broad “computational superpowers” to ChatGPT, giving access to all the general computational capabilities and computational knowledge in Wolfram Language and Wolfram|Alpha. </p>\n<p>But what if you want to make your own special plugin, that does specific computations, or has access to data or services that are for example available only on your own computer or computer system? Well, today we’re releasing a <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/Wolfram/ChatGPTPluginKit/\">first version of a kit for doing that</a>.

First, you say you need the Plugin Kit:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg3_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg3.png' alt='' title='' width='310' height='14'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Then you can immediately deploy your plugin. All it takes is:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Aimg4_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Aimg4.png' alt='' title='' width='670' height='130'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The final step is that you have to tell ChatGPT about your plugin. Within the web interface (as it’s currently configured), select <span class=\"computer-voice\">Plugins > Plugin store > Develop your own plugin</span> and insert the URL from the <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeployment</tt> (which you get by pressing the click-to-copy button <img style=\"margin-bottom: -8px\" src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Aimg5.png' alt='' title='' width='23' height='24'/>) into the dialog you get:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg6.png' alt='ChatGPT plugin dialog' title='ChatGPT plugin dialog' width='620' height='186'/></p>\n<p>Now everything’s ready. And you can start talking to ChatGPT about “word strengths”, and it’ll call your plugin (which by default is called “WolframCustom”) to compute them:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img9_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg7.png' alt='' title='' width='937' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Looking “inside the box” shows the communication ChatGPT had with the plugin:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img10_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg8.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='502'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Without the plugin it won’t know what “letter strength” is. But with the plugin, it’ll be able to do all kinds of (rather remarkable) things with it—like this:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img11_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg9.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='553'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The embellishment about properties of gnus is charming, but if one opens the boxes one can see how it got its answer—it just started trying different animals (“lion”, “zebra”, “gnu”):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img12_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg10.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='852'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Software engineers will immediately notice that the plugin we’ve set up is running against localhost, i.e. it’s executing on your own computer. As we’ll discuss, this is often an incredibly useful thing to be able to do. But you can also use the Plugin Kit to create plugins that execute purely in the <a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/\">Wolfram Cloud</a> (so that, for example, you don’t have to have a <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/engine/\">Wolfram Engine</a> available on your computer).</p>\n<p>All you do is use <tt>ChatGPTPluginCloudDeploy</tt>—then you get a URL in the Wolfram Cloud that you can tell ChatGPT as the location of your plugin:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg11_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg11A-1.png' alt='' title='' width='572' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And in fact you can do the whole setup directly in your web browser, without any local Wolfram installation. You just open a notebook in the Wolfram Cloud, and deploy your plugin from there: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg12.png' alt='Wolfram Cloud notebook' title='Wolfram Cloud notebook' width='488' height=''/></p>\n<p>Let’s do some other examples. For our next example, let’s invent the concept of a “geo influence disk” and then deploy a plugin that renders such a thing (we’ll talk later about some details of what’s being done here):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg13_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg13.png' alt='' title='' width='631' height='134'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we can install this new plugin—and then start asking ChatGPT about “geo influence disks”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img16_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg15.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='1017'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>ChatGPT successfully calls the plugin, and brings back an image. Somewhat amusingly, it guesses (correctly, as it happens) what a “geo influence disk” is supposed to be. And remember, it can’t see the picture or read the code, so its guess has to be based only on the name of the API function and the question one asks. Of course, it has to effectively understand at least a bit in order to work out how to call the API function—and that <tt>x</tt> is supposed to be a location, and <tt>radius</tt> a distance. </p>\n<p>As another example, let’s make a plugin that sends the user (i.e. the person who deploys the plugin) a text message:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg16_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg16.png' alt='' title='' width='413' height='86'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now just say “send me a message”</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img18_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg17.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='231'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>and a text message will arrive—in this case with a little embellishment from ChatGPT:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg18A.png' alt='Rhinoceros alert' title='Rhinoceros alert' width='330' height=''/></p>\n<p>Here’s a plugin that also sends an “alert picture” of an animal that’s mentioned:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg19_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg19.png' alt='' title='' width='642' height='189'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, there’s a lot of technology that needs to work to get this to happen:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img21_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg21.png' alt='' title='' width='622' height='277'/></div>\n</p></div>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg22.png' alt='Gnu alert' title='Gnu alert' width='295' height='183'/></p>\n<p>As another example, let’s make a plugin that retrieves <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/\">personal data of mine</a>—here heart rate data that I’ve been accumulating for several years in a <a href=\"https://datadrop.wolframcloud.com/\">Wolfram databin</a>: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg23_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg23.png' alt='' title='' width='556' height='86'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we can use ChatGPT to ask questions about this data:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img24_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg24.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='276'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And with the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/\">main Wolfram plugin</a> also installed, we can immediately do actual computations on this data, all through ChatGPT’s “<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/will-ais-take-all-our-jobs-and-end-human-history-or-not-well-its-complicated/\">linguistic user interface</a>”:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img25_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg25.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='814'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>This example uses the <a href=\"https://datadrop.wolframcloud.com/\">Wolfram Data Drop</a> system.

And if one has a plugin set up to access a private database there are truly remarkable things <a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/blog-posts/Published/QueryDatabasePluginDeployment.nb\">that can be done</a> through ChatGPT with the Wolfram plugin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plugins-that-control-your-own-computer\">Plugins That Control Your Own Computer</h2>\n<p>When you use ChatGPT through its standard web interface, ChatGPT is running “in the cloud”—on OpenAI’s servers. But with plugins you can “reach back”—through your web browser—to make things happen on your own, local computer. We’ll talk later about how this works “under the hood”, but suffice it to say now that when you deploy a plugin using <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> (as opposed to <tt>ChatGPTPluginCloudDeploy</tt>) the actual Wolfram Language code in the plugin will be run on your local computer. So that means it can get access to local resources on your computer, like your camera, speakers, files, etc.</p>\n<p>For example, here I’m setting up a plugin to take a picture with my computer’s camera (using the Wolfram Language <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CurrentImage.html\">CurrentImage</a></tt><tt style=\"font-weight: 600;\">[ ]</tt>)—and then blend the picture with whatever color I specify (we’ll talk about the use of <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudExport.html\">CloudExport</a></tt> later):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg26_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg26.png' alt='' title='' width='1006' height='297'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Installing the plugin, I then say to ChatGPT “Just picture me in green!”, and, right then and there, ChatGPT will call the plugin, which gets my computer to take a picture of me—and then blends it with green (complete with my “I wonder if this is going to work” look):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img27_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg27.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='555'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>OK let’s try a slightly more sophisticated example.

But we can also just accumulate results in the value of a Wolfram Language symbol. Here we initialize the symbol <tt>result</tt> to be an empty list.

What’s that tune? It seems ChatGPT can’t yet quite make the same <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/learning-about-the-future-from-2001-a-space-odyssey-fifty-years-later/#what-about-hal\">(dubious) claim</a> HAL does: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“No [HAL] 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.”</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-all-works-\">How It All Works </h2>\n<p>We’ve now seen lots of examples of using the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/Wolfram/ChatGPTPluginKit/\">ChatGPT Plugin Kit</a>. But how do they work? What’s under the hood? When you run <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> you’re basically setting up a Wolfram Language function that can be called from inside ChatGPT when ChatGPT decides it’s needed. And to make this work smoothly turns out to be something that uses a remarkable spectrum of unique capabilities of Wolfram Language—dovetailed with certain “cleverness” in ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>From a software engineering point of view, a ChatGPT plugin is fundamentally one or more web APIs—together with a “manifest” that tells ChatGPT how to call these APIs. So how does one set up a web API in Wolfram Language? Well, a <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/06/wolfram-programming-cloud-is-live/\">decade ago we invented</a> a way to make it extremely easy.</p>\n<p>Like everything in Wolfram Language, a web API is represented by a <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/symbolic-expressions/\">symbolic expression</a>, in this case of the form <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt><tt>[…]</tt>. What’s inside the <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt>? There are two pieces. A piece of Wolfram Language code that implements the function one wants, together with a specification for how the strings that will actually be passed to the <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt> (say from a web API) should be interpreted before feeding them to the Wolfram Language code.</p>\n<p>Here’s a little piece of Wolfram Language code, in this case for <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/07-colors-and-styles.html\">negating a color</a>, then making it lighter:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg57_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg57A.png' alt='' title='' width='278' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>If we wanted to, we could refactor this as a “<a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/26-pure-anonymous-functions.html\">pure function</a>” applied to two arguments:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg58_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg58A.png' alt='' title='' width='359' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>On its own the pure function is just a symbolic expression that evaluates to itself:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg59_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg59A.png' alt='' title='' width='278' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>If we want to, we can name the arguments of the pure function, then supply them in an <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/34-associations.html\">association</a> (<span class='InlineFormula'><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg60.png' width= '53' height='13' align='absmiddle'></span>) with their names as keys:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg61_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg61A.png' alt='' title='' width='577' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But let’s say we want to call our function from a web API. The parameters in the web API are always strings. So how can we convert from a string (like <tt>\"lime green\"</tt>) to a symbolic expression that Wolfram Language can understand? Well, we have to use the <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/natural-language-understanding/\">natural language understanding</a> capabilities of Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example, where we’re saying we want to <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Interpreter.html\">interpret</a> a string as a color:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg62_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg62A.png' alt='' title='' width='294' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>What really is that color swatch?

The first argument says the API we’re representing has two parameters, and describes how we want to interpret these. The second argument gives the actual Wolfram Language function that the API computes. On its own, the <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt> is just a symbolic expression that evaluates to itself:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg64_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg64A.png' alt='' title='' width='609' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But if we supply values for the parameters (here using an association) it’ll evaluate:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg65_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg65.png' alt='' title='' width='979' height='102'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>So far all this is just happening inside our Wolfram Language session. But to get an actual web API we just have to “cloud deploy” our <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg66_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg66.png' alt='' title='' width='991' height='104'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we can call this web API, say from a web browser:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg67.png' alt='Web API' title='Web API' width='620' height='196'/></p>\n<p>And, yes, that’s the symbolic expression result. If we’d wanted something visual, we could tell the <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt> to give its results, say as a <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/PNG.html\">PNG</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg68_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg68.png' alt='' title='' width='518' height='38'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And now it’ll show up as an image in a web browser:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg69.png' alt='Purple box in web browser' title='Purple box in web browser' width='620' height='196'/></p>\n<p>(Note that <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudDeploy.html\">CloudDeploy</a></tt> deploys a web API that by default has permissions set so that only I can run it. If you use <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudPublish.html\">CloudPublish</a></tt> instead, anyone will be able to run it.)</p>\n<p>OK, so how do we set up our web API so it can be called as a ChatGPT plugin? One immediate issue is that at the simplest level ChatGPT just deals with text, so we’ve somehow got to convert our result to text. So let’s do a little Wolfram Language programming to achieve that. Here’s a list of values and names of common colors from the <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/knowledgebase/\">Wolfram Knowledgebase</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg70_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw050923img1.png' alt='' title='' width='621' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, we know about many other collections of named colors too, but let’s not worry about that here:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg71_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw050923img2D.png' alt='' title='' width='705' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we can use <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nearest.html\">Nearest</a></tt> to find which common color is nearest to the color we’ve got:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg72_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg72.png' alt='' title='' width='606' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now let’s put this into an <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt> (we’ve “<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Iconize.html\">iconized</a>” the list of colors here; we could also have defined a separate function for finding nearest colors, which would automatically be brought along by <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudDeploy.html\">CloudDeploy</a></tt>):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg73_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw050923Aimg1.png' alt='' title='' width='594' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we’re ready to use <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt>. The way ChatGPT plugins work, we’ve got to give a name to the “endpoint” corresponding to our API. And this name—along with the names we used for the parameters in our API—will be used by ChatGPT to figure out when and how to call our plugin. But in this example, we just want to use some kind of unique name for the endpoint, so we’ll be able to refer to it in our chat without ChatGPT confusing it with something else. So let’s call it <tt>ColorMangle</tt>. So now let’s do the deployment:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg74_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw050923Aimg2.png' alt='' title='' width='599' height='256'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Everything we’ve said so far about <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html\">APIFunction</a></tt> and how it’s called works the same in <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> and <tt>ChatGPTPluginCloudDeploy</tt>. But what we’ll say next is different. Because <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> sets up the API function to execute on your local computer, while <tt>ChatGPTPluginCloudDeploy</tt> sets it up to run in the <a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/\">Wolfram Cloud</a> (or it could be a <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/enterprise-private-cloud/\">Wolfram Enterprise Private Cloud</a>, etc.). </p>\n<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to both local and cloud deployment. Running locally allows you to get access to local features of your computer, like camera, filesystem, etc. Running in the cloud allows you to let other people also run your plugin (though, currently, unless you <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">register your plugin with OpenAI</a>, only a limited number of people will be able to install your plugin at any one time).</p>\n<p>But, OK, let’s talk about local plugin deployment. <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> effectively sets up a <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/WebServerDeploy/\">minimal web server on your computer</a> (implemented with <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/WebServerDeploy/\">10 lines of Wolfram Language code</a>), running on a port that <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> chooses, and calling the Wolfram Engine with your API function whenever it receives a request to the API’s URL.</p>\n<p>Here’s the operating system socket that <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> is using (and, yes, the Wolfram Language represents sockets—like everything else—as symbolic expressions):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg75_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/05/sw050923Bimg1.png' alt='' title='' width='659' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>OK, but how does ChatGPT know about your API? First, you have to tell it the port you’re using, which you do through the ChatGPT UI (<span class=\"computer-voice\">Plugins > Plugin store > Develop your own plugin</span>). You can find the port by clicking the <img style=\"margin-bottom: -8px\" src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg76.png' alt='' title='' width='23' height='24'/> icon in the <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeployment</tt> object, or programmatically with:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg77_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg77A.png' alt='' title='' width='488' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>You enter this URL, then tell ChatGPT to “Find manifest file”: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg78.png' alt='Find manifest file' title='Find manifest file' width='620' height='186'/></p>\n<p>Let’s look at what it found:</p>\n<p> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg79.png' alt='' title='' width='365' height=''></p>\n<p>It’s a “manifest” that tells it about the plugin you’re installing. We didn’t specify much, so most things here are just defaults. But an important piece of the manifest is the part that gives the URL for API spec: <span class=\"computer-voice\">http://localhost:59353/.well-known/openapi.json</span> </p>\n<p>And going there we find this “OpenAPI spec”: </p>\n<p><img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg80.png' alt='Validated OpenAPI spec' title='Validated OpenAPI spec' width='200' height=''> </p>\n<p>Finally, click <span style=\"color:#000000;font-size:13px;font-family:AppleSystemUIFont\"><span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>Install localhost plugin</kbd></kbd></span></span>, and the plugin will show up in the list of installed plugins in your ChatGPT session:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg81_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg81.png' alt='' title='' width='450' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And when ChatGPT starts with the plugin installed, it includes an extra piece in its “system prompt”, that lets it “learn” how to call the plugin: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg82C.png' alt='System prompt' title='System prompt' width='260' height=''/></p>\n<p>So now we’re ready to use the plugin:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img83_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg83.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='310'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, it works. But there’s a bit of magic here. Somehow ChatGPT had to “take apart” what we’d asked, realize that the API endpoint called <tt>ColorMangle</tt> was relevant, then figure out that its color parameter should be “lime green”, and its level should be “0.5”. Opening the box, we can see what it did:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img84_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg84.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='609'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And now we can start using “color mangling” in other places—though ChatGPT hastens to tell us that “color mangling” is a “fictional operation”, perhaps lest it’s accused of disrespecting a country’s flag colors:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img85_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg85.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='603'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>In the case we’re dealing with here, ChatGPT manages to correctly “wire up” fragments of text to appropriate parameters in our API. And it does that (rather remarkably) just from the scrap of information it gleans from the names we used for the parameters (and the name we gave the endpoint). </p>\n<p>But sometimes we have to tell it a bit more, and we can do that by specifying a prompt for the plugin inside <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg86_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg86.png' alt='' title='' width='595' height='176'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now we don’t have to just talk about colors:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042823img87_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg87.png' alt='' title='' width='933' height='1075'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At first, it didn’t successfully “untangle” the “colors of Iceland”, but then it corrected itself, and got the answers. (And, yes, we might have been able to avoid this by writing a better prompt.)</p>\n<p>And actually, there are multiple levels of prompts you can give. You can include a fairly long prompt for the whole plugin. Then you can give shorter prompts for each individual API endpoint. And finally, you can give prompts to help ChatGPT interpret individual parameters in the API, for example by replacing <tt>\"color\" </tt><tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Rule.html\">&rarr;</a></tt><tt> \"Color\"</tt> with something like:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg88_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw042723Ximg88.png' alt='' title='' width='513' height='14'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>When you set up a plugin, it can contain many endpoints, that do different things. And—in addition to sharing prompts—one reason this is particularly convenient is that (at least right now, for security reasons) any given subdomain can have only one associated plugin. So if one wants to have a range of functionality, this has to be implemented by having different endpoints.</p>\n<p>For <tt>ChatGPTPluginCloudDeploy</tt> the one-plugin-per-subdomain limit currently means that any given user can only deploy one cloud plugin at a time. But for local plugins the rules are a bit different, and <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> can deploy multiple plugins by just having them run on different ports—and indeed by default <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> just <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SocketOpen.html\">picks a random unused port</a> every time you call it.</p>\n<p>But how does a local plugin really work? And how does it “reach back” to your computer? The magic is basically happening in the ChatGPT web front end. The way all plugins work is that when the plugin is going to be called, the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">token-at-a-time generation process</a> of the LLM stops, and the next action of the “outer loop” is to call the plugin—then add whatever result it gives to the string that will be fed to the LLM at the next step. Well, in the case of a local plugin, the outer loop uses JavaScript in the ChatGPT front end to send a request locally on your computer to the localhost port you specified. (By the way, once <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> opens a port, it’ll stay open until you explicitly call <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Close.html\">Close</a></tt> on its <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SocketObject.html\">socket object</a>.)</p>\n<p>When one’s using local plugins, they’re running their Wolfram Language code right in the Wolfram Language session from which the plugin was deployed. And this means, for example, that (as we saw in some cases above) values that get set in one plugin call are still there when another call is made. </p>\n<p>In the cloud it doesn’t immediately work this way, because each API call is effectively independent. But it’s straightforward to save state in cloud objects (say using <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudPut.html\">CloudPut</a></tt>, or with <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudExpression.html\">CloudExpression</a></tt>, etc.) so that one can have “persistent memory” across many API calls.</p>\n<p>The LLM inside ChatGPT is (currently) set up to deal only with text. So what happens with images? Well, plugins can put them into the Wolfram Cloud, then pass their URLs to ChatGPT. And ChatGPT is set up to be able to render directly certain special kinds of things—like images. </p>\n<p>So—as we saw above—to “output” an image (or several) from a plugin, we can use <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudExport.html\">CloudExport</a></tt> to put each image in a cloud object, say in PNG format. And then ChatGPT, perhaps with some prompting, can show the image inline in its output.</p>\n<p>There’s some slightly tricky “plumbing” in deploying Wolfram Language plugins in ChatGPT, most of which is handled automatically in <tt>ChatGPTPluginDeploy</tt> and <tt>ChatGPTPluginCloudDeploy</tt>. But by building on the fundamental symbolic structure of the Wolfram Language (and its integrated deployment capabilities) it’s remarkably straightforward to create elaborate custom Wolfram Language plugins for ChatGPT, and to contribute to the emerging ecosystem around LLMs and Wolfram Language.</p>\n",

And today—just two and a half months later—I’m excited to announce that <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">it’s happened</a>! Thanks to some heroic software engineering by <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/\">our team</a> and by <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAI</a>, ChatGPT can now call on Wolfram|Alpha—and <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> as well—to give it what we might think of as “computational superpowers”. It’s still very early days for all of this, but it’s already very impressive—and one can begin to see how amazingly powerful (and perhaps even revolutionary) what we can call “<nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr>” can be.</p>\n<p>Back in January, I made the point that, as an <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">LLM neural net</a>, ChatGPT—for all its remarkable prowess in textually generating material “like” what it’s read from the web, etc.—<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">can’t itself be expected to do actual nontrivial computations</a>, or to systematically produce correct (rather than just “looks roughly right”) data, etc. But when it’s connected to the Wolfram plugin it can do these things. So here’s my (very simple) first example from January, but now done by ChatGPT with “Wolfram superpowers” installed:<span id=\"more-46756\"></span></p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img2.png' alt='How far is it from Tokyo to Chicago?' title='How far is it from Tokyo to Chicago?' width='622' height='232'/></p>\n<p>It’s a correct result (which in January it wasn’t)—found by actual computation. And here’s a bonus: immediate visualization:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img3.png' alt='Show the path' title='Show the path' width='622' height='388'/></p>\n<p>How did this work? Under the hood, ChatGPT is formulating a query for Wolfram|Alpha—then <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/resources/tools-for-AIs/\">sending it to Wolfram|Alpha for computation</a>, and then “deciding what to say” based on reading the results it got back. You can see this back and forth by clicking the “Used Wolfram” box (and by looking at this you can check that ChatGPT didn’t “make anything up”):</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img4A.png' alt='Used Wolfram' title='Used Wolfram' width='621' height='444'/></p>\n<p>There are lots of nontrivial things going on here, on both the ChatGPT and Wolfram|Alpha sides. But the upshot is a good, correct result, knitted into a nice, flowing piece of text. </p>\n<p>Let’s try another example, also from what I wrote in January: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img5.png' alt='What is the integral?' title='What is the integral?' width='622' height='539/2'/></p>\n<p>A fine result, <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+is+the+integral+of+x%5E2+cos%282x%29\">worthy of our technology</a>. And again, we can get a bonus:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img6.png' alt='Plot that' title='Plot that' width='622' height='494'/></p>\n<p>In January, I noted that ChatGPT ended up just “making up” plausible (but wrong) data when given this prompt:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img7.png' alt='Tell me about livestock populations' title='Tell me about livestock populations' width='622' height='633/2'/></p>\n<p>But now it calls the Wolfram plugin and gets a <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/Country.html\">good, authoritative answer</a>. And, as a bonus, we can also make a visualization:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img8A.png' alt='Make a bar chart' title='Make a bar chart' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<p>Another example from back in January that now comes out correctly is: </p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img9.png' alt='What planetary moons are larger than Mercury?' title='What planetary moons are larger than Mercury?' width='621' height='675/2'/></p>\n<p>If you actually try these examples, don’t be surprised if they work differently (sometimes better, sometimes worse) from what I’m showing here. Since <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">ChatGPT uses randomness</a> in generating its responses, different things can happen even when you ask it the exact same question (even in a fresh session). It feels “very human”. But different from the solid “right-answer-and-it-doesn’t-change-if-you-ask-it-again” experience that one gets in Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example where we saw ChatGPT (rather impressively) “having a conversation” with the Wolfram plugin, after at first finding out that it got the “wrong Mercury”:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img10.png' alt='How big is Mercury?' title='How big is Mercury?' width='622' height='482'/></p>\n<p>One particularly significant thing here is that ChatGPT isn’t just using us to do a “dead-end” operation like show the content of a webpage. Rather, we’re acting much more like a true “brain implant” for ChatGPT—where it asks us things whenever it needs to, and we give responses that it can weave back into whatever it’s doing. It’s rather impressive to see in action. And—although there’s definitely much more polishing to be done—what’s already there goes a long way towards (among other things) giving ChatGPT the ability to deliver accurate, curated knowledge and data—as well as correct, nontrivial computations.</p>\n<p>But there’s more too. We already saw examples where we were able to provide custom-created visualizations to ChatGPT. And with our computation capabilities we’re routinely able to make “truly original” content—computations that have simply never been done before. And there’s something else: while “pure ChatGPT” is <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#the-training-of-chatgpt\">restricted to things it “learned during its training”</a>, by calling us it can get up-to-the-moment data. </p>\n<p>This can be based on our real-time data feeds (here we’re getting called twice; once for each place):</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img11.png' alt='Compare current temperature in Timbuktu and New York' title='Compare current temperature in Timbuktu and New York' width='622' height='254'/></p>\n<p>Or it can be based on “science-style” predictive computations:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img12.png' alt='How far is it to Jupiter right now?' title='How far is it to Jupiter right now?' width='622' height='380'/></p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img13.png' alt='What is the configuration of the moons of Jupiter now?' title='What is the configuration of the moons of Jupiter now?' width='622' height='390'/></p>\n<p>Or both:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img14.png' alt='Where is the ISS in the sky from NYC?' title='Where is the ISS in the sky from NYC?' width='622' height='277'/></p>\n<h2 id=\"some-of-the-things-you-can-do\">Some of the Things You Can Do</h2>\n<p>There’s a lot that <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\">Wolfram|Alpha</a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> cover:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img15B.png' alt='Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language content areas' title='Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language content areas' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>And now (almost) all of this is accessible to ChatGPT—opening up a tremendous breadth and depth of new possibilities.

But what can one do when that conversation has actual computation and computational knowledge in it? Here’s an example. Start by asking a “world knowledge” question:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img16.png' alt='Beef production query' title='Beef production query' width='622' height='432'/></p>\n<p>And, yes, by “opening the box” one can check that the right question was asked to us, and what the raw response we gave was. But now we can go on and ask for a map:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img17.png' alt='Make a map' title='Make a map' width='622' height='444'/></p>\n<p>But there are “prettier” map projections we could have used. And with ChatGPT’s “general knowledge” based on its reading of the web, etc. we can just ask it to use one:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img18.png' alt='Use a prettier map projection' title='Use a prettier map projection' width='622' height='448'/></p>\n<p>But maybe we want a heat map instead. Again, we can just ask it to produce this—underneath using our technology:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img19.png' alt='Show as a heat map' title='Show as a heat map' width='622' height='478'/></p>\n<p>Let’s change the projection again, now asking it again to pick it using its “general knowledge”:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img20.png' alt='Use UN logo map projection' title='Use UN logo map projection' width='622' height='1231/2'/></p>\n<p>And, yes, it got the projection “right”. But not the centering. So let’s ask it to fix that:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img21.png' alt='Center map projection on North Pole' title='Center map projection on North Pole' width='622' height='592'/></p>\n<p>OK, so what do we have here? We’ve got something that we “collaborated” to build. We incrementally said what we wanted; the AI (i.e. <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr>) progressively built it. But what did we actually get? Well, it’s a piece of Wolfram Language code—which we could see by “opening the box”, or just asking ChatGPT for:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img22.png' alt='Show the code used' title='Show the code used' width='622' height='426'/></p>\n<p>If we copy the code out into a <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/\">Wolfram Notebook</a>, we can immediately run it, and we find it has a nice “luxury feature”—as ChatGPT claimed in its description, there are dynamic tooltips giving the name of each country:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img23A_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img23-v2.png' alt='' title='' width='611' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>(And, yes, it’s a slight pity that this code just has explicit numbers in it, rather than the original symbolic query about beef production. And this happened because ChatGPT asked the original question to Wolfram|Alpha, then fed the results to Wolfram Language. But I consider the fact that this whole sequence works at all extremely impressive.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works—and-wrangling-the-ai\">How It Works—and Wrangling the AI</h2>\n<p>What’s happening “under the hood” with ChatGPT and the Wolfram plugin? Remember that the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">core of ChatGPT is a “large language model” (LLM)</a> that’s trained from the web, etc. to generate a “reasonable continuation” from any text it’s given. But as a final part of its training ChatGPT is also taught how to “hold conversations”, and when to “ask something to someone else”—where that “someone” might be a human, or, for that matter, a plugin. And in particular, it’s been taught when to reach out to the Wolfram plugin.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram plugin actually has two entry points: a Wolfram|Alpha one and a Wolfram Language one. The Wolfram|Alpha one is in a sense the “easier” for ChatGPT to deal with; the Wolfram Language one is ultimately the more powerful. The reason the Wolfram|Alpha one is easier is that what it takes as input is just natural language—which is exactly what ChatGPT routinely deals with. And, more than that, Wolfram|Alpha is built to be forgiving—and in effect to <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/natural-language-understanding/\">deal with “typical human-like input”</a>, more or less however messy that may be.</p>\n<p>Wolfram Language, on the other hand, is set up to be precise and well defined—and capable of being used to build arbitrarily sophisticated towers of computation. Inside Wolfram|Alpha, what it’s doing is to translate natural language to precise Wolfram Language. In effect it’s catching the “imprecise natural language” and “funneling it” into precise Wolfram Language. </p>\n<p>When ChatGPT calls the Wolfram plugin it often just feeds natural language to Wolfram|Alpha. But ChatGPT has by this point learned a certain amount about writing Wolfram Language itself. And in the end, as we’ll discuss later, that’s a more flexible and powerful way to communicate. But it doesn’t work unless the Wolfram Language code is exactly right. To get it to that point is partly a matter of training. But there’s another thing too: given some candidate code, the Wolfram plugin can run it, and if the results are obviously wrong (like they generate lots of errors), ChatGPT can attempt to fix it, and try running it again. (More elaborately, ChatGPT can try to generate tests to run, and change the code if they fail.)</p>\n<p>There’s more to be developed here, but already one sometimes sees ChatGPT go back and forth multiple times. It might be rewriting its Wolfram|Alpha query (say simplifying it by taking out irrelevant parts), or it might be deciding to switch between Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language, or it might be rewriting its Wolfram Language code. Telling it how to do these things is a matter for the initial “plugin prompt”. </p>\n<p>And writing this prompt is a strange activity—perhaps our first serious experience of trying to “<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/language-and-communication/\">communicate with an alien intelligence</a>”. Of course it helps that the “alien intelligence” has been trained with a vast corpus of human-written text. So, for example, it knows English (a bit like all those corny science fiction aliens&#8230;). And we can tell it things like “If the user input is in a language other than English, translate to English and send an appropriate query to Wolfram|Alpha, then provide your response in the language of the original input.” </p>\n<p>Sometimes we’ve found we have to be quite insistent (note the all caps): “When writing Wolfram Language code, NEVER use snake case for variable names; ALWAYS use camel case for variable names.” And even with that insistence, ChatGPT will still sometimes do the wrong thing. The whole process of “prompt engineering” feels a bit like animal wrangling: you’re trying to get ChatGPT to do what you want, but it’s hard to know just what it will take to achieve that. </p>\n<p>Eventually this will presumably be handled in training or in the prompt, but as of right now, ChatGPT sometimes doesn’t know when the Wolfram plugin can help. For example, ChatGPT guesses that this is supposed to be a DNA sequence, but (at least in this session) doesn’t immediately think the Wolfram plugin can do anything with it:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img24.png' alt='DNA strand input' title='DNA strand input' width='622' height='286'/></p>\n<p>Say “Use Wolfram”, though, and it’ll send it to the Wolfram plugin, which indeed handles it nicely:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img025A.png' alt='Use Wolfram' title='Use Wolfram' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<p>(You may sometimes also want to say specifically “Use Wolfram|Alpha” or “Use Wolfram Language”. And particularly in the Wolfram Language case, you may want to look at the actual code it sent, and tell it things like not to use functions whose names it came up with, but which don’t actually exist.)</p>\n<p>When the Wolfram plugin is given Wolfram Language code, what it does is basically just to evaluate that code, and return the result—perhaps as a graphic or math formula, or just text. But when it’s given Wolfram|Alpha input, this is sent to a special <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/resources/tools-for-AIs/\">Wolfram|Alpha “for LLMs” API</a> endpoint, and the result comes back as text intended to be “read” by ChatGPT, and effectively used as an additional prompt for further text ChatGPT is writing. Take a look at this example:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img26.png' alt='Ocean depth query' title='Ocean depth query' width='622' height='230'/></p>\n<p>The result is a nice piece of text containing the answer to the question asked, along with some other information ChatGPT decided to include. But “inside” we can see what the Wolfram plugin (and the Wolfram|Alpha “LLM endpoint”) actually did:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img027A.png' alt='Ocean depth code' title='Ocean depth code' width='622' height='738'/></p>\n<p>There’s quite a bit of additional information there (including some nice pictures!). But ChatGPT “decided” just to pick out a few pieces to include in its response.</p>\n<p>By the way, something to emphasize is that if you want to be sure you’re getting what you think you’re getting, always check what ChatGPT actually sent to the Wolfram plugin—and what the plugin returned. One of the important things we’re adding with the Wolfram plugin is a way to “factify” ChatGPT output—and to know when ChatGPT is “using its imagination”, and when it’s delivering solid facts. </p>\n<p>Sometimes in trying to understand what’s going on it’ll also be useful just to take what the Wolfram plugin was sent, and enter it as direct input on the Wolfram|Alpha website, or in a Wolfram Language system (such as the <a href=\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/\">Wolfram Cloud</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"wolfram-language-as-the-language-for-human-ai-collaboration\">Wolfram Language as the Language for Human-AI Collaboration</h2>\n<p>One of the great (and, frankly, unexpected) things about ChatGPT is its ability to start from a rough description, and generate from it a polished, finished output—such as an essay, letter, legal document, etc. In the past, one might have tried to achieve this “by hand” by starting with “boilerplate” pieces, then modifying them, “gluing” them together, etc. But ChatGPT has <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/will-ais-take-all-our-jobs-and-end-human-history-or-not-well-its-complicated/\">all but made this process obsolete</a>. In effect, it’s “absorbed” a huge range of boilerplate from what it’s “read” on the web, etc.—and now it typically does a good job at seamlessly “adapting it” to what you need.</p>\n<p>So what about code? In traditional programming languages writing code tends to involve a lot of “boilerplate work”—and in practice many programmers in such languages spend lots of their time building up their programs by copying big slabs of code from the web. But now, suddenly, it seems as if ChatGPT can make much of this obsolete. Because it can effectively put together essentially any kind of boilerplate code automatically—with only a little “human input”. </p>\n<p>Of course, there has to be some human input—because otherwise ChatGPT wouldn’t know what program it was supposed to write. But—one might wonder—why does there have to be “boilerplate” in code at all? Shouldn’t one be able to have a language where—just at the level of the language itself—all that’s needed is a small amount of human input, without any of the “boilerplate dressing”?</p>\n<p>Well, here’s the issue. Traditional programming languages are centered around telling a computer what to do in the computer’s terms: set this variable, test that condition, etc. But it doesn’t have to be that way. And instead one can start from the other end: take things people naturally think in terms of, then try to represent these computationally—and effectively automate the process of getting them actually implemented on a computer.</p>\n<p>Well, this is what I’ve now spent more than four decades working on. And it’s the foundation of what’s now Wolfram Language—which I now feel justified in calling a “<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/\">full-scale computational language</a>”. What does this mean? It means that right in the language there’s a computational representation for both abstract and real things that we talk about in the world, whether those are <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/GraphsAndNetworks.html\">graphs</a> or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ImageProcessing.html\">images</a> or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/DifferentialEquations.html\">differential equations</a>—or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/City.html\">cities</a> or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/Chemical.html\">chemicals</a> or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/Company.html\">companies</a> or <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/Movie.html\">movies</a>. </p>\n<p>Why not just start with natural language? Well, that works up to a point—as the success of Wolfram|Alpha demonstrates. But once one’s trying to specify something more elaborate, natural language becomes (like “legalese”) at best unwieldy—and one really needs a more structured way to express oneself.</p>\n<p>There’s a big example of this historically, in mathematics. Back before about 500 years ago, pretty much the only way to “express math” was in natural language. But then mathematical notation was invented, and math took off—with the development of algebra, calculus, and eventually all the various mathematical sciences.</p>\n<p>My big goal with the Wolfram Language is to create a computational language that can do the same kind of thing for anything that can be “expressed computationally”. And to achieve this we’ve needed to build a language that both automatically does a lot of things, and intrinsically knows a lot of things. But the result is a language that’s set up so that people can conveniently “express themselves computationally”, much as traditional mathematical notation lets them “express themselves mathematically”. And a critical point is that—unlike traditional programming languages—Wolfram Language is intended not just for computers, but also for humans, to read. In other words, it’s intended as a structured way of “communicating computational ideas”, not just to computers, but also to humans.</p>\n<p>But now—with ChatGPT—this suddenly becomes even more important than ever before. Because—as we began to see above—ChatGPT can work with Wolfram Language, in a sense building up computational ideas just using natural language. And part of what’s then critical is that Wolfram Language can directly represent the kinds of things we want to talk about. But what’s also critical is that it gives us a way to “know what we have”—because we can realistically and economically read Wolfram Language code that ChatGPT has generated.</p>\n<p>The whole thing is beginning to work very nicely with the Wolfram plugin in ChatGPT. Here’s a simple example, where ChatGPT can readily generate a Wolfram Language version of what it’s being asked:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img28C.png' alt='Make a plot of Roman numerals' title='Make a plot of Roman numerals' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img29A.png' alt='Join the points' title='Join the points' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img30.png' alt='Show the code' title='Show the code' width='622' height='403'/></p>\n<p>And the critical point is that the “code” is something one can realistically expect to read (if I were writing it, I would use the slightly more compact <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RomanNumeral.html\"><tt>RomanNumeral</tt></a> function):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img31_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img31.png' alt='' title='' width='558' height='62'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here’s another example:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img32A.png' alt='Make a histogram' title='Make a histogram' width='622' height=''/><br />\n<img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img33.png' alt='Show the code' title='Show the code' width='622' height='333'/></p>\n<p>I might have written the code a little differently, but this is again something very readable:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img34_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img34.png' alt='' title='' width='509' height='38'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>It’s often possible to use a pidgin of Wolfram Language and English to say what you want:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img35.png' alt='Create table' title='Create table' width='622' height='337'/><br />\n<img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img36.png' alt='Make ArrayPlot' title='Make ArrayPlot' width='622' height='1167/2'/></p>\n<p>Here’s an example where ChatGPT is again successfully constructing Wolfram Language—and conveniently shows it to us so we can confirm that, yes, it’s actually computing the right thing:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img37.png' alt='Alkali metal query' title='Alkali metal query' width='622' height='482'/></p>\n<p>And, by the way, to make this work it’s critical that the Wolfram Language is in a sense “self-contained”.

Or at least, a result. Because when we look at this computation, it might not be quite what we want. For example, we might want to pick out multiple dominant colors per country, and see if any of them are close to purple. But the whole Wolfram Language setup here makes it easy for us to “collaborate with the AI” to figure out what we want, and what to do.</p>\n<p>So far we’ve basically been starting with natural language, and building up Wolfram Language code. But we can also start with pseudocode, or code in some low-level programming language. And ChatGPT tends to do a remarkably good job of taking such things and producing well-written Wolfram Language code from them. The code isn’t always exactly right. But one can always run it (e.g. with the Wolfram plugin) and see what it does, potentially (courtesy of the symbolic character of Wolfram Language) line by line. And the point is that the high-level computational language nature of the Wolfram Language tends to allow the code to be sufficiently clear and (at least locally) simple that (particularly after seeing it run) one can readily understand what it’s doing—and then potentially iterate back and forth on it with the AI.</p>\n<p>When what one’s trying to do is sufficiently simple, it’s often realistic to specify it—at least if one does it in stages—purely with natural language, using Wolfram Language “just” as a way to see what one’s got, and to actually be able to run it. But it’s when things get more complicated that Wolfram Language really comes into its own—providing what’s basically the only viable human-understandable-yet-precise representation of what one wants. </p>\n<p>And when I was writing my book <em><a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction\">An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language</a></em> this became particularly obvious. At the beginning of the book I was easily able to make up exercises where I described what was wanted in English. But as things started getting more complicated, this became more and more difficult. As a &#8220;fluent&#8221; user of Wolfram Language I usually immediately knew how to express what I wanted in Wolfram Language. But to describe it purely in English required something increasingly involved and complicated, that read like legalese.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so you specify something using Wolfram Language. Then one of the remarkable things ChatGPT is often able to do is to recast your Wolfram Language code so that it’s easier to read. It doesn’t (yet) always get it right. But it’s interesting to see it make different tradeoffs from a human writer of Wolfram Language code. For example, humans tend to find it difficult to come up with good names for things, making it usually better (or at least less confusing) to avoid names by having sequences of nested functions. But ChatGPT, with its command of language and meaning, has a fairly easy time making up reasonable names. And although it’s something I, for one, did not expect, I think using these names, and “spreading out the action”, can often make Wolfram Language code even easier to read than it was before, and indeed read very much like a formalized analog of natural language—that we can understand as easily as natural language, but that has a precise meaning, and can actually be run to generate computational results. </p>\n<h2 id=\"cracking-some-old-chestnuts\">Cracking Some Old Chestnuts</h2>\n<p>If you “know what computation you want to do”, and you can describe it in a short piece of natural language, then Wolfram|Alpha is set up to directly do the computation, and present the results in a way that is “visually absorbable” as easily as possible. But what if you want to describe the result in a narrative, textual essay? Wolfram|Alpha has never been set up to do that. But ChatGPT is. </p>\n<p>Here’s a result from Wolfram|Alpha:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img47A.png' alt='Altair versus Betelgeuse Wolfram|Alpha query' title='Altair versus Betelgeuse Wolfram|Alpha query' width='620' height=''/></p>\n<p>And here within ChatGPT we’re asking for this same Wolfram|Alpha result, but then telling ChatGPT to “make an essay out of it”:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img48A.png' alt='Altair-Betelgeuse essay' title='Altair-Betelgeuse essay' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<p>Another “old chestnut” for Wolfram|Alpha is math word problems. Given a “crisply presented” math problem, Wolfram|Alpha is likely to do very well at solving it. But what about a “woolly” word problem? Well, ChatGPT is pretty good at “unraveling” such things, and turning them into “crisp math questions”—which then the Wolfram plugin can now solve. Here’s an example:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img50A.png' alt='Math word problem' title='Math word problem' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<p>Here’s a slightly more complicated case, including a nice use of “common sense” to recognize that the number of turkeys cannot be negative:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img51A.png' alt='Math word problem' title='Math word problem' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<p>Beyond math word problems, another “old chestnut” now addressed by <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> is what physicists tend to call “Fermi problems”: order-of-magnitude estimates that can be made on the basis of quantitative knowledge about the world. Here’s an example:</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw032223img54-v2.png' alt='Order-of-magnitude query' title='Order-of-magnitude query' width='622' height=''/></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-involved\">How to Get Involved</h2>\n<p><nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> is something very new—really a completely new kind of technology. And as happens whenever a new kind of technology arrives, it’s opening up tremendous new opportunities. Some of these we can already begin to to see—but lots of others will emerge over the weeks, months and years to come. </p>\n<p>So how can you get involved in what promises to be an exciting period of rapid technological—and conceptual—growth? The first thing is just to explore <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr>. ChatGPT and Wolfram are each on their own vast systems; the combination of them is something that it’ll take years to fully plumb. But the first step is just to get a sense of what’s possible. </p>\n<p>Find examples. <a href=\"https://community.wolfram.com/\">Share them</a>. Try to identify successful patterns of usage. And, most of all, try to find workflows that deliver the highest value. Those workflows could be quite elaborate. But they could also be quite simple—cases where once one sees what can be done, there’s an immediate “aha”. </p>\n<p>How can you best implement a workflow? Well, we’re trying to work out the best workflows for that. Within Wolfram Language we’re setting up flexible ways to call on things like ChatGPT, both <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/1e47aeaf-9015-4ce7-bfdd-aae85980ca40/\">purely programmatically</a>, and in the context of the notebook interface. </p>\n<p>But what about from the ChatGPT side? Wolfram Language has a very open architecture, where a user can add or modify pretty much whatever they want. But how can you use this from ChatGPT? One thing is just to tell ChatGPT to include some specific piece of “initial” Wolfram Language code (maybe together with documentation)—then use something like the pidgin above to talk to ChatGPT about the functions or other things you’ve defined in that initial code. </p>\n<p>We’re planning to build increasingly streamlined tools for handling and sharing Wolfram Language code for use through ChatGPT. But one approach that already works is to submit functions for publication in the <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository\">Wolfram Function Repository</a>, then—once they’re published—refer to these functions in your conversation with ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>OK, but what about within ChatGPT itself? What kind of prompt engineering should you do to best interact with the Wolfram plugin? Well, we don’t know yet. It’s something that has to be explored—in effect as an exercise in AI education or AI psychology. A typical approach is to give some “pre-prompts” earlier in your ChatGPT session, then hope it’s “still paying attention” to those later on. (And, yes, it has a limited “attention span”, so sometimes things have to get repeated.) </p>\n<p>We’ve tried to give an overall prompt to tell ChatGPT basically how to use the Wolfram plugin—and we fully expect this prompt to evolve rapidly, as we learn more, and as the ChatGPT LLM is updated. But you can add your own general pre-prompts, saying things like “When using Wolfram always try to include a picture” or “Use SI units” or “Avoid using complex numbers if possible”. </p>\n<p>You can also try setting up a pre-prompt that essentially “defines a function” right in ChatGPT—something like: “If I give you an input consisting of a number, you are to use Wolfram to draw a polygon with that number of sides”. Or, more directly, “If I give you an input consisting of numbers you are to apply the following Wolfram function to that input &#8230;”, then give some explicit Wolfram Language code.</p>\n<p>But these are very early days, and no doubt there’ll be other powerful mechanisms discovered for “programming” <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr>. And I think we can confidently expect that the next little while will be an exciting time of high growth, where there’s lots of valuable “low-hanging fruit” to be picked by those who chose to get involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-background-&#038;-outlook\">Some Background &#038; Outlook</h2>\n<p>Even a week ago it wasn’t clear what <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> was going to be like—or how well it was going to work. But these things that are now moving so quickly are built on decades of earlier development. And in some ways the arrival of <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> finally marries the two main approaches historically taken to AI—that have long been viewed as disjoint and incompatible. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">ChatGPT is basically a very large neural network</a>, trained to follow the “statistical” patterns of text it’s seen on the web, etc. The concept of neural networks—in a form surprisingly close to what’s used in ChatGPT—originated all the way back in the 1940s. But after some enthusiasm in the 1950s, interest waned. There was a resurgence in the early 1980s (and indeed I myself first looked at neural nets then). But it wasn’t until 2012 that serious excitement began to build about what might be possible with neural nets. And now a decade later—in a development whose success came as a big surprise even to those involved—we have ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>Rather separate from the “statistical” tradition of neural nets is the “symbolic” tradition for AI. And in a sense that tradition arose as an extension of the process of formalization developed for mathematics (and mathematical logic), particularly near the beginning of the twentieth century. But what was critical about it was that it aligned well not only with abstract concepts of computation, but also with actual digital computers of the kind that started to appear in the 1950s.</p>\n<p>The successes in what could really be considered “AI” were for a long time at best spotty. But all the while, the general concept of computation was showing tremendous and growing success. But how might “computation” be related to ways people think about things? For me, a crucial development was <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/\">my idea at the beginning of the 1980s</a> (building on earlier formalism from mathematical logic) that transformation rules for symbolic expressions might be a good way to represent computations at what amounts to a “human” level. </p>\n<p>At the time my main focus was on <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/\">mathematical and technical computation</a>, but I soon began to wonder whether similar ideas might be applicable to “general AI”. I suspected something like neural nets might have a role to play, but at the time I only figured out a bit about what would be needed—and not how to achieve it. Meanwhile, the core idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions became the foundation for what’s now the Wolfram Language—and made possible the decades-long process of developing the full-scale computational language that we have today.</p>\n<p>Starting in the 1960s there’d been efforts among AI researchers to develop systems that could “understand natural language”, and “represent knowledge” and answer questions from it. Some of what was done turned into less ambitious but practical applications. But generally success was elusive. Meanwhile, as a result of what amounted to a <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/\">philosophical conclusion of basic science</a> I’d done in the 1990s, <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/\">I decided around 2005 to make an attempt</a> to build a general “computational knowledge engine” that could broadly answer factual and computational questions posed in natural language. It wasn’t obvious that such a system could be built, but we discovered that—with our underlying computational language, and with a lot of work—it could. And in 2009 we were able to release <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\">Wolfram|Alpha</a>. </p>\n<p>And in a sense what made Wolfram|Alpha possible was that internally it had a clear, formal way to represent things in the world, and to compute about them. For us, “understanding natural language” wasn’t something abstract; it was the concrete process of translating natural language to structured computational language. </p>\n<p>Another part was assembling all the data, methods, models and algorithms needed to “know about” and “compute about” the world. And while we’ve greatly automated this, we’ve still always found that to ultimately “get things right” there’s no choice but to have actual human experts involved. And while there’s a little of what one might think of as “statistical AI” in the natural language understanding system of Wolfram|Alpha, the vast majority of Wolfram|Alpha—and Wolfram Language—operates in a hard, symbolic way that’s at least reminiscent of the tradition of symbolic AI. (That’s not to say that individual functions in Wolfram Language don’t use machine learning and statistical techniques; in recent years more and more do, and the Wolfram Language also has a whole built-in <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/core-areas/machine-learning/\">framework for doing machine learning</a>.)</p>\n<p>As I’ve <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\">discussed elsewhere</a>, what seems to have emerged is that “statistical AI”, and particularly neural nets, are well suited for tasks that we humans “do quickly”, including—as we learn from ChatGPT—natural language and the “thinking” that underlies it. But the symbolic and in a sense “more rigidly computational” approach is what’s needed when one’s building larger “conceptual” or computational “towers”—which is what happens in math, exact science, and now all the “computational X” fields. </p>\n<p>And now <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> can be thought of as the first truly large-scale statistical + symbolic “AI” system. In Wolfram|Alpha (which became an original core part of things like the Siri intelligent assistant) there was for the first time broad natural language understanding—with “understanding” directly tied to actual computational representation and computation. And now, 13 years later, we’ve seen in ChatGPT that pure “statistical” neural net technology, when trained from almost the entire web, etc. can do remarkably well at “statistically” generating “human-like” “meaningful language”. And in <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> we’re now able to leverage the whole stack: from the pure “statistical neural net” of ChatGPT, through the “computationally anchored” natural language understanding of Wolfram|Alpha, to the whole computational language and computational knowledge of Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>When we were first building Wolfram|Alpha we thought that perhaps to get useful results we’d have no choice but to engage in a conversation with the user. But we discovered that if we immediately generated rich, “visually scannable” results, we only needed a simple “Assumptions” or “Parameters” interaction—at least for the kind of information and computation seeking we expected of our users. (In <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-alpha-notebook-edition/\">Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition</a> we nevertheless have a powerful example of how multistep computation can be done with natural language.) </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2010/11/programming-with-natural-language-is-actually-going-to-work/\">Back in 2010 we were already experimenting</a> with generating not just the Wolfram Language code of typical Wolfram|Alpha queries from natural language, but also “whole programs”. At the time, however—without modern LLM technology—that didn’t get all that far. But what we discovered was that—in the context of the symbolic structure of the Wolfram Language—even having small fragments of what amounts to code be generated by natural language was extremely useful. And indeed I, for example, use the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/EnterFreeFormInput.html\"><span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>=</kbd></span> mechanism</a> in <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/\">Wolfram Notebooks</a> countless times almost every day, for example to construct symbolic entities or quantities from natural language. We don’t yet know quite what the modern “LLM-enabled” version of this will be, but it’s likely to involve the rich human-AI “collaboration” that we discussed above, and that we can begin to see in action for the first time in <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr>.</p>\n<p>I see what’s happening now as a historic moment. For well over half a century the statistical and symbolic approaches to what we might call “AI” evolved largely separately. But now, in <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr> they’re being brought together. And while we’re still just at the beginning with this, I think we can reasonably expect tremendous power in the combination—and in a sense a new paradigm for “AI-like computation”, made possible by the arrival of ChatGPT, and now by its combination with Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language in <nobr>ChatGPT + Wolfram</nobr>.</p>\n",

But then <a href='https://chat.openai.com/chat' target=_blank rel=noopener>ChatGPT</a> burst onto the scene. And suddenly we realized that an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/'>AI could write a passable human-like essay</a>. So now it’s natural to wonder: How far will this go? What will AIs be able to do? And how will we humans fit in?</p>\n<p>My goal here is to explore some of the science, technology—and philosophy—of what we can expect from AIs. I should say at the outset that this is a subject fraught with both intellectual and practical difficulty. And all I’ll be able to do here is give a snapshot of my current thinking—which will inevitably be incomplete—not least because, as I’ll discuss, trying to predict how history in an area like this will unfold is something that runs straight into an issue of basic science: the phenomenon of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>.<span id=\"more-46460\"></span></p>\n<p>But let’s start off by talking about that particularly dramatic example of AI that’s just arrived on the scene: ChatGPT. So <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/'>what is ChatGPT</a>? Ultimately, it’s a computational system for generating text that’s been set up to follow the patterns defined by human-written text from billions of webpages, millions of books, etc. Give it a textual prompt and it’ll continue in a way that’s somehow typical of what it’s seen us humans write.</p>\n<p>The results (which ultimately rely on all sorts of specific engineering) are remarkably “human like”. And what makes this work is that whenever <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#models-for-human-like-tasks'>ChatGPT has to “extrapolate”</a> beyond anything it’s explicitly seen from us humans it does so in ways that seem similar to what we as humans might do. </p>\n<p>Inside ChatGPT is something that’s actually computationally probably quite similar to a brain—with millions of simple elements (“neurons”) forming a “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#neural-nets'>neural net</a>” with billions of connections that have been “tweaked” through a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#machine-learning,-and-the-training-of-neural-nets'>progressive process of training</a> until they successfully reproduce the patterns of human-written text seen on all those webpages, etc. Even without training the neural net would still produce some kind of text. But the key point is that it won’t be text that we humans consider meaningful. To get such text we need to build on all that “human context” defined by the webpages and other materials we humans have written. The “raw computational system” will just do “raw computation”; to get something aligned with us humans requires leveraging the detailed human history captured by all those pages on the web, etc.</p>\n<p>But so what do we get in the end? Well, it’s text that basically reads like it was written by a human. In the past we might have thought that human language was somehow a uniquely human thing to produce. But now we’ve got an AI doing it. So what’s left for us humans? Well, somewhere things have got to get started: in the case of text, there’s got to be a prompt specified that tells the AI “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#meaning-space-and-semantic-laws-of-motion'>what direction to go in</a>”. And this is the kind of thing we’ll see over and over again. Given a defined “goal”, an AI can automatically work towards achieving it. But it ultimately takes something beyond the raw computational system of the AI to define what us humans would consider a meaningful goal. And that’s where we humans come in.</p>\n<p>What does this mean at a practical, everyday level? Typically we use ChatGPT by telling it—using text—what we basically want. And then it’ll fill in a whole essay’s worth of text talking about it. We can think of this interaction as corresponding to a kind of “linguistic user interface” (that we might dub a “LUI”). In a graphical user interface (GUI) there’s core content that’s being rendered (and input) through some potentially elaborate graphical presentation. In the LUI provided by ChatGPT there’s instead core content that’s being rendered (and input) through a textual (“linguistic”) presentation.</p>\n<p>You might jot down a few “bullet points”. And in their raw form someone else would probably have a hard time understanding them. But through the LUI provided by ChatGPT those bullet points can be turned into an “essay” that can be generally understood—because it’s based on the “shared context” defined by everything from the billions of webpages, etc. on which ChatGPT has been trained.</p>\n<p>There’s something about this that might seem rather unnerving. In the past, if you saw a custom-written essay you’d reasonably be able to conclude that a certain irreducible human effort was spent in producing it. But with ChatGPT this is no longer true. Turning things into essays is now “free” and automated. “Essayification” is no longer evidence of human effort. </p>\n<p>Of course, it’s hardly the first time there’s been a development like this. Back when I was a kid, for example, seeing that a document had been typeset was basically evidence that someone had gone to the considerable effort of printing it on printing press. But then came desktop publishing, and it became basically free to make any document be elaborately typeset. </p>\n<p>And in a longer view, this kind of thing is basically a constant trend in history: what once took human effort eventually becomes automated and “free to do” through technology. There’s a direct analog of this in the realm of ideas: that with time higher and higher levels of abstraction are developed, that subsume what were formerly laborious details and specifics. </p>\n<p>Will this end? Will we eventually have automated everything? Discovered everything? Invented everything? At some level, we now know that the answer is a resounding no. Because one of the consequences of the phenomenon of computational irreducibility is that there’ll always be more computations to do—that can’t in the end be reduced by any finite amount of automation, discovery or invention. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, this will be a more subtle story. Because while there may always be more computations to do, it could still be that we as humans don’t care about them. And that somehow everything we care about can successfully be automated—say by AIs—leaving “nothing more for us to do”. </p>\n<p>Untangling this issue will be at the heart of questions about how we fit into the AI future. And in what follows we’ll see over and over again that what might at first essentially seem like practical matters of technology quickly get enmeshed with deep questions of science and philosophy.</p>\n<h2 id='intuition-from-the-computational-universe'>Intuition from the Computational Universe</h2>\n<p>I’ve already mentioned computational irreducibility a couple of times. And it turns out that this is part of a circle of rather deep—and at first surprising—ideas that I believe are crucial to thinking about the AI future. </p>\n<p>Most of our existing intuition about “machinery” and “automation” comes from a kind of “clockwork” view of engineering—in which we specifically build systems component by component to achieve objectives we want. And it’s the same with most software: we write it line by line to specifically do—step by step—whatever it is we want. And we expect that if we want our machinery—or software—to do complex things then the underlying structure of the machinery or software must somehow be correspondingly complex.</p>\n<p>So when I started exploring the whole computational universe of possible programs in the early 1980s it was a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>big surprise to discover</a> that things work quite differently there. And indeed even tiny programs—that effectively just apply very simple rules repeatedly—<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>can generate great complexity</a>. In our usual practice of engineering we haven’t seen this, because we’ve always specifically picked programs (or other structures) where we can readily foresee how they’ll behave, so that we can explicitly set them up to do what we want. But out in the computational universe it’s very common to see programs that just “intrinsically generate” great complexity, without us ever having to explicitly “put it in”.</p>\n<div style=\"width:20%; height:auto;float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-top:20px;\">\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/longca-1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/longca-1.png' alt='' title=''></div>\n</div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>And having discovered this, we realize that there’s actually a big example that’s been around forever: the natural world. And indeed it increasingly seems as if the “secret” that nature uses to make the complexity it so often shows is exactly to operate according to the rules of simple programs. (For about three centuries it seemed as if mathematical equations were the ultimate way to describe the natural world—but in the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/twenty-years-later-the-surprising-greater-implications-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>past few decades</a>, and particularly poignantly with our recent <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>, it’s become clear that simple programs are in general a more powerful approach.)</p>\n<p>How does all this relate to technology? Well, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>technology is about</a> taking what’s out there in the world, and harnessing it for human purposes. And there’s a fundamental tradeoff here. There may be some system out in nature that does amazingly complex things. But the question is whether we can “slice off” certain particular things that we humans happen to find useful. A donkey has all sorts of complex things going on inside. But at some point it was discovered that we can use it “technologically” to do the rather simple thing of pulling a cart.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to programs out in the computational universe it’s extremely common to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html'>see ones that do amazingly complex things</a>. But the question is whether we can find some aspect of those things that’s useful to us. Maybe the program is good at <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-5--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness'>making pseudorandomness</a>. Or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/'>distributedly determining consensus</a>. Or maybe it’s just doing its complex thing, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>we don’t yet know any “human purpose”</a> that this achieves.</p>\n<p>One of the notable features of a system like ChatGPT is that it isn’t <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/'>constructed in an “understand-every-step” traditional engineering way</a>. Instead one basically just starts from a “raw computational system” (in the case of ChatGPT, a neural net), then progressively tweaks it until its behavior aligns with the “human-relevant” examples one has. And this alignment is what makes the system “technologically useful”—to us humans.</p>\n<p>Underneath, though, it’s still a computational system, with all the potential “wildness” that implies. And free from the “technological objective” of “human-relevant alignment” the system might do all sorts of sophisticated things. But they might not be things that (at least at this time in history) we care about. Even though some putative alien (or our future selves) might.</p>\n<p>OK, but let’s come back to the “raw computation” side of things. There’s something very different about computation from all other kinds of “mechanisms” we’ve seen before. We might have a cart that can move forward. And we might have a stapler that can put staples in things. But carts and staplers do very different things; there’s no equivalence between them. But for computational systems (at least ones that don’t just always behave in obviously simple ways) there’s my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>—which implies that all these systems are in a sense equivalent in the kinds of computations they can do.</p>\n<p>This equivalence has many consequences. One of them is that one can expect to make something equally computationally sophisticated out of all sorts of different kinds of things—whether brain tissue or electronics, or some system in nature. And this is effectively where <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> comes from.</p>\n<p>One might think that given, say, some computational system based on a simple program it would always be possible for us—with our sophisticated brains, mathematics, computers, etc.—to “jump ahead” and figure out what the system will do before it’s gone through all the steps to do it. But the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that this won’t in general be possible—because the system itself can be as computationally sophisticated as our brains, mathematics, computers, etc. are. So this means that the system will be computationally irreducible: the only way to find out what it does is effectively just to go through the same whole computational process that it does.</p>\n<p>There’s a prevailing impression that science will always eventually be able do better than this: that it’ll be able to make “predictions” that allow us to work out what will happen without having to trace through each step. And indeed over the past three centuries there’s been lots of success in doing this, mainly by using mathematical equations. But ultimately it turns out that this has only been possible because science has ended up concentrating on particular systems where these methods work (and then these systems have been used for engineering). But the reality is that many systems show computational irreducibility. And in the phenomenon of computational irreducibility science is in effect “deriving its own limitedness”.</p>\n<p>Contrary to traditional intuition, try as we might, in many systems we’ll never be able find “formulas” (or other “shortcuts”) that describe what’s going to happen in the systems—because the systems are simply computationally irreducible. And, yes, this represents a limitation on science, and on knowledge in general. But while at first this might seem like a bad thing, there’s also something fundamentally satisfying about it. Because if everything were computationally reducible, we could always “jump ahead” and find out what will happen in the end, say in our lives. But computational irreducibility implies that in general we can’t do that—so that in some sense “something irreducible is being achieved” by the passage of time.</p>\n<p>There are a great many consequences of computational irreducibility. Some—that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>I have particularly explored recently</a>—are in the domain of basic science (for example, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>establishing core laws of physics</a> as we perceive them from the interplay of computational irreducibility and our computational limitations as observers). But computational irreducibility is also central in thinking about the AI future—and in fact I increasingly feel that it adds the single most important intellectual element needed to make sense of many of the most important questions about the potential roles of AIs and humans in the future.</p>\n<p>For example, from our traditional experience with engineering we’re used to the idea that to find out why something happened in a particular way we can just “look inside” a machine or program and “see what it did”. But when there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/testifying-at-the-senate-about-a-i-selected-content-on-the-internet/#open-up-the-ai'>computational irreducibility, that won’t work</a>. Yes, we could “look inside” and see, say, a few steps. But computational irreducibility implies that to find out what happened, we’d have to trace through all the steps. We can’t expect to find a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#what-can-one-understand'>“simple human narrative”</a> that “says why something happened”. </p>\n<p>But having said this, one feature of computational irreducibility is that within any computationally irreducible systems there must always be (ultimately, infinitely many) “pockets of computational reducibility” to be found. So for example, even though we can’t say in general what will happen, we’ll always be able to identify specific features that we can predict. (“The leftmost cell will always be black”, etc.) And as we’ll discuss later we can potentially think of technological (as well as scientific) progress as being intimately tied to the discovery of these “pockets of reducibility”. And in effect the existence of infinitely many such pockets is the reason that “there’ll always be inventions and discoveries to be made”.</p>\n<p>Another consequence of computational irreducibility has to do with trying to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>ensure things about the behavior of a system</a>. Let’s say one wants to set up an AI so it’ll “never do anything bad”. One might imagine that one could just come up with particular rules that ensure this. But as soon as the behavior of the system (or its environment) is computationally irreducible one will never be able to guarantee what will happen in the system. Yes, there may be particular computationally reducible features one can be sure about. But in general computational irreducibility implies that there’ll always be a “possibility of surprise” or the potential for “unintended consequences”. And the only way to systematically avoid this is to make the system not computationally irreducible—which means it can’t make use of the full power of computation.</p>\n<h2 id='&ldquo;ais-will-never-be-able-to-do-that&rdquo;'>&ldquo;AIs Will Never Be Able to Do That&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>We humans like to feel special, and feel as if there’s something “fundamentally unique” about us. Five centuries ago we thought we lived at the center of the universe. Now we just tend to think that there’s something about our intellectual capabilities that’s fundamentally unique and beyond anything else. But the progress of AI—and things like ChatGPT—keep on giving us more and more evidence that that’s not the case. And indeed my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> says something even more extreme: that at a fundamental computational level there’s just nothing fundamentally special about us at all—and that in fact we’re computationally just equivalent to lots of systems in nature, and even to simple programs.</p>\n<p>This broad equivalence is important in being able to make very general scientific statements (like the existence of computational irreducibility). But it also highlights how significant our specifics—our particular history, biology, etc.—are. It’s very much like with ChatGPT. We can have a generic (untrained) neural net with the same structure as ChatGPT, that can do certain “raw computation”. But what makes ChatGPT interesting—at least to us—is that it’s been trained with the “human specifics” described on billions of webpages, etc. In other words, for both us and ChatGPT there’s nothing computationally “generally special”. But there is something “specifically special”—and it’s the particular history we’ve had, particular knowledge our civilization has accumulated, etc. </p>\n<p>There’s a curious analogy here to our physical place in the universe. There’s a certain uniformity to the universe, which means there’s nothing “generally special” about our physical location. But at least to us there’s still something “specifically special” about it, because it’s only here that we have our particular planet, etc. At a deeper level, ideas based on our Physics Project have led to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>concept of the ruliad</a>: the unique object that is the entangled limit of all possible computational processes. And we can then view our whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>experience as “observers of the universe”</a> as consisting of sampling the ruliad at a particular place.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit abstract (and a long story, which I won’t go into in any detail here), but we can think of different possible observers as being both at different places in physical space, and at different places in rulial space—giving them different “points of view” about what happens in the universe. Human minds are in effect concentrated in a particular region of physical space (mostly on this planet) and a particular region of rulial space. And in rulial space different human minds—with their different experiences and thus different ways of thinking about the universe—are in slightly different places. Animal minds might be fairly close in rulial space. But other computational systems (like, say, the weather, which is sometimes said to “have a mind of its own”) are further away—as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#face-to-face-with-alien-intelligence,-out-in-rulial-space'>putative aliens might also be</a>. </p>\n<p>So what about AIs? It depends what we mean by “AIs”. If we’re talking about computational systems that are set up to do “human-like things” then that means they’ll be close to us in rulial space. But insofar as “an AI” is an arbitrary computational system it can be anywhere in rulial space, and it can do anything that’s computationally possible—which is far broader than what we humans can do, or even think about. (As we’ll talk about later, as our intellectual paradigms—and ways of observing things—expand, the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>region of rulial space in which we humans operate</a> will correspondingly expand.)</p>\n<p>But, OK, just how “general” are the computations that we humans (and the AIs that follow us) are doing? We don’t know enough about the brain to be sure. But if we look at artificial neural net systems—like ChatGPT—we can potentially get some sense. And in fact the computations really don’t seem to be that “general”. In most neural net systems data that’s given as input just <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/'>“ripples once through the system”</a> to produce output. It’s not like in a computational system like a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machine</a> where there can be arbitrary “recirculation of data”. And indeed without such “arbitrary recirculation” the computation is necessarily quite “shallow” and can’t ultimately show computational irreducibility. </p>\n<p>It’s a bit of a technical point, but one can ask whether ChatGPT, with its “re-feeding of text produced so far” can in fact achieve <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>arbitrary (“universal”) computation</a>. And I suspect that in some formal sense it can (or at least a sufficiently expanded analog of it can)—though by producing an extremely verbose piece of text that for example in effect lists successive (self-delimiting) states of a Turing machine tape, and in which finding “the answer” to a computation will take a bit of effort. But—<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\">as I’ve discussed elsewhere</a>—in practice ChatGPT is presumably almost exclusively doing “quite shallow” computation.</p>\n<p>It’s an interesting feature of the history of practical computing that what one might consider “deep pure computations” (say in mathematics or science) were done for decades before <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/'>“shallow human-like computations” became feasible</a>. And the basic reason for this is that for “human-like computations” (like recognizing images or generating text) one needs to capture lots of “human context”, which requires having lots of “human-generated data” and the computational resources to store and process it. </p>\n<p>And, by the way, brains also seem to specialize in fundamentally shallow computations. And to do the kind of deeper computations that allow one to take advantage of more of what’s out there in the computational universe, one has to turn to computers. As we’ve discussed, there’s plenty out in the computational universe that we humans don’t (yet) care about: we just consider it “raw computation”, that doesn’t seem to be “achieving human purposes”. But as a practical matter it’s important to make a bridge between the things we humans do care about and think about, and what’s possible in the computational universe. And in a sense that’s at the core of the project I’ve put so much effort into in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> of creating a full-scale computational language that describes in computational terms the things we think about, and experience in the world.</p>\n<p>OK, people have been saying for years: “It’s nice that computers can do A and B, but only humans can do X”. What X is supposed to be has changed—and narrowed—over the years. And ChatGPT provides us with a major unexpected new example of something more that computers can do.</p>\n<p>So what’s left? People might say: “Computers can never show creativity or originality”. But—perhaps disappointingly—that’s surprisingly easy to get, and indeed just a bit of randomness “seeding” a computation can often do a pretty good job, as we saw years ago with our <a href='https://tones.wolfram.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>WolframTones</a> music-generation system, and as we see today with ChatGPT’s writing. People might also say: “Computers can never show emotions”. But before we had a good way to generate human language we wouldn’t really have been able to tell. And now it already works pretty well to ask ChatGPT to write “happily”, “sadly”, etc. (In their raw form emotions in both humans and other animals are presumably associated with rather simple “global variables” like neurotransmitter concentrations.)</p>\n<p>In the past people might have said: “Computers can never show judgement”. But by now there are endless examples of machine learning systems that do well at reproducing human judgement in lots of domains. People might also say: “Computers don’t show common sense”. And by this they typically mean that in a particular situation a computer might locally give an answer, but there’s a global reason why that answer doesn’t make sense, that the computer “doesn’t notice”, but a person would. </p>\n<p>So how does ChatGPT do on this? Not too badly. In plenty of cases it correctly recognizes that “that’s not what I’ve typically read”. But, yes, it makes mistakes. Some of them have to do with it not being able to do—purely with its neural net—even slightly “deeper”computations. (And, yes, that’s something that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/'>can often be fixed</a> by it calling <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> as a tool.) But in other cases the problem seems to be that it can’t quite connect different domains well enough.</p>\n<p>It’s perfectly capable of doing simple (“SAT-style”) analogies. But when it comes to larger-scale ones it doesn’t manage them. My guess, though, is that it won’t take much scaling up before it starts to be able to make what seem like very impressive analogies (that most of us humans would never even be able to make)—at which point it’ll probably successfully show broader “common sense”. </p>\n<p>But so what’s left that humans can do, and AIs can’t? There’s—almost by definition—one fundamental thing: define what we would consider goals for what to do. We’ll talk more about this later. But for now we can note that any computational system, once “set in motion”, will just follow its rules and do what it does. But what “direction should it be pointed in”? That’s something that has to come from “outside the system”.</p>\n<p>So how does it work for us humans? Well, our goals are in effect defined by the whole web of history—both from biological evolution and from our cultural development—in which we are embedded. But ultimately the only way to truly participate in that web of history is to be part of it.</p>\n<p>Of course, we can imagine technologically emulating every “relevant” aspect of a brain—and indeed things like the success of ChatGPT may suggest that that’s easier to do than we might have thought. But that won’t be enough. To participate in the “human web of history” (as we’ll discuss later) we’ll have to emulate other aspects of “being human”—like moving around, being mortal, etc. And, yes, if we make an “artificial human” we can expect it (by definition) to show all the features of us humans.</p>\n<p>But while we’re still talking about AIs as—for example—“running on computers” or “being purely digital” then, at least as far as we’re concerned, they’ll have to “get their goals from outside”. One day (as we’ll discuss) there will no doubt be some kind of “civilization of AIs”—which will form its own web of history. But at this point there’s no reason to think that we’ll still be able to describe what’s going on in terms of goals that we recognize. In effect the AIs will at that point have left our domain of rulial space. And—as we’ll discuss—they’ll be operating more like the kind of systems we see in nature, where we can tell there’s computation going on, but we can’t describe it, except rather anthropomorphically, in terms of human goals and purposes.</p>\n<h2 id='will-there-be-anything-left-for-the-humans-to-do?'>Will There Be Anything Left for the Humans to Do?</h2>\n<p>It’s been an issue that’s been raised—with varying degrees of urgency—for centuries: with the advance of automation (and now AI), will there eventually be nothing left for humans to do? Back in the early days of our species, there was lots of hard work of hunting and gathering to do, just to survive. But at least in the developed parts of the world, that kind of work is now at best a distant historical memory.</p>\n<p>And yet at each stage in history—at least so far—there always seem to be other kinds of work that keep people busy. But there’s a pattern that increasingly seems to repeat. Technology in some way or another enables some new occupation. And eventually that occupation becomes widespread, and lots of people do it. But then there’s a technological advance, and the occupation gets automated—and people aren’t needed to do it anymore. But now there’s a new level of technology, that enables new occupations. And the cycle continues.</p>\n<p>A century ago the increasingly widespread use of telephones meant that more and more people worked as switchboard operators. But then telephone switching was automated—and those switchboard operators weren’t needed anymore. But with automated switching there could be huge development of telecommunications infrastructure, opening up all sorts of new types of jobs, that in aggregate employ vastly more people than were ever switchboard operators. </p>\n<p>Something somewhat similar happened with accounting clerks. Before there were computers, one needed to have people laboriously tallying up numbers. But with computers, that was all automated away. But with that automation came the ability to do more complex financial computations—which allowed for more complex financial transactions, more complex regulations, etc., which in turn led to all sorts of new types of jobs. </p>\n<p>And across a whole range of industries, it’s been the same kind of story. Automation obsoletes some jobs, but enables others. There’s quite often a gap in time, and a change in the skills that are needed. But at least so far there always seems to have been a broad frontier of jobs that have been made possible—but haven’t yet been automated.</p>\n<p>Will this at some point end? Will there come a time when everything we humans want (or at least need) is delivered automatically? Well, of course, that depends on what we want, and whether, for example, that evolves with what technology has made possible. But could we just decide that “enough is enough”; let’s stop here, and just let everything be automated?</p>\n<p>I don’t think so. And the reason is ultimately because of computational irreducibility. We try to get the world to be “just so”, say set up so we’re “predictably comfortable”. Well, the problem is that there’s inevitably computational irreducibility in the way things develop—not just in nature, but in things like societal dynamics too. And that means that things won’t stay “just so”. There’ll always be something unpredictable that happens; something that the automation doesn’t cover. </p>\n<p>At first we humans might just say “we don’t care about that”. But in time computational irreducibility will affect everything. So if there’s anything at all we care about (including, for example, not going extinct), we’ll eventually have to do something—and go beyond whatever automation was already set up.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to find practical examples. We might think that when computers and people are all connected in a seamless automated network, there’d be nothing more to do. But what about the “unintended consequence” of computer security issues? What might have seemed like a case where “technology finished things” quickly creates a new kind of job for people to do. And at some level, computational irreducibility implies that things like this must always happen. There must always be a “frontier”. At least if there’s anything at all we want to preserve (like not going extinct). </p>\n<p>But let’s come back to the situation here and now with AI. ChatGPT just automated all sorts of text-related tasks. It used to take lots of effort—and people—to write customized reports, letters, etc. But (at least so long as one’s dealing with situations where one doesn’t need 100% “correctness”) ChatGPT just automated a lot of that, so people aren’t needed for it anymore. But what will this mean? Well, it means that there’ll be a lot more customized reports, letters, etc. that can be produced. And that will lead to new kinds of jobs—managing, analyzing, validating etc. all that mass-customized text. Not to mention the need for prompt engineers (a job category that just didn’t exist until a few months ago), and what amount to AI wranglers, AI psychologists, etc.</p>\n<p>But let’s talk about today’s “frontier” of jobs that haven’t been “automated away”. There’s one category that in many ways seems surprising to still be “with us”: jobs that involve lots of mechanical manipulation, like construction, fulfillment, food preparation, etc. But there’s a missing piece of technology here: there isn’t yet good general-purpose robotics (as there is general-purpose computing), and we humans still have the edge in dexterity, mechanical adaptability, etc. But I’m quite sure that in time—and perhaps quite suddenly—the necessary technology will be developed (and, yes, I have ideas about how to do it). And this will mean that most of today’s “mechanical manipulation” jobs will be “automated away”—and won’t need people to do them.</p>\n<p>But then, just as in our other examples, this will mean that mechanical manipulation will become much easier and cheaper to do, and more of it will be done. Houses might routinely be built and dismantled. Products might routinely be picked up from wherever they’ve ended up, and redistributed. Vastly more ornate “food constructions” might become the norm. And each of these things—and many more—will open up new jobs. </p>\n<p>But will every job that exists in the world today “on the frontier” eventually be automated? What about jobs where it seems like a large part of the value is just “having a human be there”? Jobs like flying a plane where one wants the “commitment” of the pilot being there in the plane. Caregiver jobs where one wants the “connection” of a human being there. Sales or education jobs where one wants “human persuasion” or “human encouragement”. Today one might think “only a human can make one feel that way”. But that’s typically based on the way the job is done now. And maybe there’ll be different ways found that allow the essence of the task to be automated, almost inevitably opening up new tasks to be done.</p>\n<p>For example, something that in the past needed “human persuasion” might be “automated” by something like gamification—but then more of it can be done, with new needs for design, analytics, management, etc.</p>\n<p>We’ve been talking about “jobs”. And that term immediately brings to mind wages, economics, etc. And, yes, plenty of what people do (at least in the world as it is today) is driven by issues of economics. But plenty is also not. There are things we “just want to do”—as a “social matter”, for “entertainment”, for “personal satisfaction”, etc.</p>\n<p>Why do we want to do these things? Some of it seems intrinsic to our biological nature. Some of it seems determined by the “cultural environment” in which we find ourselves. Why might one walk on a treadmill? In today’s world one might explain that it’s good for health, lifespan, etc. But a few centuries ago, without modern scientific understanding, and with a different view of the significance of life and death, that explanation really wouldn’t work.</p>\n<p>What drives such changes in our view of what we “want to do”, or “should do”? Some seems to be driven by the pure “dynamics of society”, presumably with its own computational irreducibility. But some has to do with our ways of interacting with the world—both the increasing automation delivered by the advance of technology, and the increasing abstraction delivered by the advance of knowledge.</p>\n<p>And there seem to be similar “cycles” seen here as in the kinds of things we consider to be “occupations” or “jobs”. For a while something is hard to do, and serves as a good “pastime”. But then it gets “too easy” (“everybody now knows how to win at game X”, etc.), and something at a “higher level” takes its place.</p>\n<p>About our “base” biologically driven motivations it doesn’t seem like anything has really changed in the course of human history. But there are certainly technological developments that could have an effect in the future. Effective human immortality, for example, would change many aspects of our motivation structure. As would things like the ability to implant memories or, for that matter, implant motivations.</p>\n<p>For now, there’s a certain element of what we want to do that’s “anchored” by our biological nature. But at some point we’ll surely be able to emulate with a computer at least the essence of what our brains are doing (and indeed the success of things like ChatGPT makes it seems like the moment when that will happen is closer at hand than we might have thought). And at that point we’ll have the possibility of what amount to “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#box-of-a-trillion-souls'>disembodied human souls</a>”. </p>\n<p>To us today it’s very hard to imagine what the “motivations” of such a “disembodied soul” might be. Looked at “from the outside” we might “see the soul” doing things that “don’t make much sense” to us. But it’s like asking what someone from a thousand years ago would think about many of our activities today. These activities make sense to us today because we’re embedded in our whole “current framework”. But without that framework they don’t make sense. And so it will be for the “disembodied soul”. To us, what it does may not make sense. But to it, with its “current framework”, it will.</p>\n<p>Could we “learn how to make sense of it”? There’s likely to be a certain barrier of computational irreducibility: in effect the only way to “understand the soul of the future” is to retrace its steps to get to where it is. So from our vantage point today, we’re separated by a certain “irreducible distance”, in effect in rulial space.</p>\n<p>But could there be some science of the future that will at least tell us general things about how such “souls” behave? Even when there’s computational irreducibility we know that there will always be pockets of computational reducibility—and thus features of behavior that are predictable. But will those features be “interesting”, say from our vantage point today? Maybe some of them will be. Maybe they’ll show us some kind of metapsychology of souls. But inevitably they can only go so far. Because in order for those souls to even experience the passage of time there has to be computational irreducibility. If too much of what happens is too predictable, it’s as if “nothing is happening”—or at least nothing “meaningful”.</p>\n<p>And, yes, this is all tied up with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-7--the-phenomenon-of-free-will'>questions about “free will”</a>. Even when there’s a disembodied soul that’s operating according to some completely deterministic underlying program, computational irreducibility means its behavior can still “seem free”—because nothing can “outrun it” and say what it’s going to be. And the “inner experience” of the disembodied soul can be significant: it’s “intrinsically defining its future”, not just “having its future defined for it”.</p>\n<p>One might have assumed that once everything is just “visibly operating” as “mere computation” it would necessarily be “soulless” and “meaningless”. But computational irreducibility is what breaks out of this, and what allows there to be something irreducible and “meaningful” achieved. And it’s the same phenomenon whether one’s talking about our life now in the physical universe, or a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#box-of-a-trillion-souls'>future “disembodied” computational existence</a>. Or in other words, even if absolutely everything—even our very existence—has been “automated by computation”, that doesn’t mean we can’t have a perfectly good “inner experience” of meaningful existence.</p>\n<h2 id='generalized-economics-and-the-concept-of-progress'>Generalized Economics and the Concept of Progress</h2>\n<p>If we look at human history—or, for that matter, the history of life on Earth—there’s a certain pervasive sense that there’s some kind of “progress” happening. But what fundamentally is this “progress”? One can view it as the process of things being done at a progressively “higher level”, so that in effect “more of what’s important” can happen with a given effort. This idea of “going to a higher level” takes many forms—but they’re all fundamentally about eliding details below, and being able to operate purely in terms of the “things one cares about”.</p>\n<p>In technology, this shows up as automation, in which what used to take lots of detailed steps gets packaged into something that can be done “with the push of a button”. In science—and the intellectual realm in general—it shows up as abstraction, where what used to involve lots of specific details gets packaged into something that can be talked about “purely collectively”. And in biology it shows up as some structure (ribosome, cell, wing, etc.) that can be treated as a “modular unit”. </p>\n<p>That it’s possible to “do things at a higher level” is a reflection of being able to find “pockets of computational reducibility”. And—as we mentioned above—the fact that (given underlying computational irreducibility) there are necessarily an infinite number of such pockets means that “progress can always go on forever”.</p>\n<p>When it comes to human affairs we tend to value such progress highly, because (at least for now) we live finite lives, and insofar as we “want more to happen”, “progress” makes that possible. It’s certainly not self-evident that having more happen is “good”; one might just “want a quiet life”. But there is one constraint that in a sense originates from the deep foundations of biology. </p>\n<p>If something doesn’t exist, then nothing can ever “happen to it”. So in biology, if one’s going to have anything “happen” with organisms, they’d better not be extinct. But the physical environment in which biological organisms exist is finite, with many resources that are finite. And given organisms with finite lives, there’s an inevitability to the process of biological evolution, and to the “competition” for resources between organisms.</p>\n<p>Will there eventually be an “ultimate winning organism”? Well, no, there can’t be—because of computational irreducibility. There’ll in a sense always be more to explore in the computational universe—more “raw computational material for possible organisms”. And given any “fitness criterion” (like—in a Turing machine analog—“living longer before halting”) there’ll always be a way to “do better” with it. </p>\n<p>One might still wonder, however, whether perhaps biological evolution—with its underlying process of random genetic mutation—could “get stuck” and never be able to discover some “way to do better”. And indeed simple models of evolution might give one the intuition that this would happen. But actual evolution seems more like deep learning with a large neural net—where one’s effectively operating in an extremely high-dimensional space where there’s typically always a “way to get there from here”, at least given enough time.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so from our history of biological evolution there’s a certain built-in sense of “competition for scarce resources”. And this sense of competition has (so far) also carried over to human affairs. And indeed it’s the basic driver for most of the processes of economics.</p>\n<p>But what if resources aren’t “scarce” anymore? What if progress—in the form of automation, or AI—makes it easy to “get anything one wants”? We might imagine robots building everything, AIs figuring everything out, etc. But there are still things that are inevitably scarce. There’s only so much real estate. Only one thing can be “the first ___”. And, in the end, if we have finite lives, we only have so much time.</p>\n<p>Still, the more efficient—or high level—the things we do (or have) are, the more we’ll be able to get done in the time we have. And it seems as if what we perceive as “economic value” is intimately connected with “making things higher level”. A finished phone is “worth more” than its raw materials. An organization is “worth more” than its separate parts. But what if we could have “infinite automation”? Then in a sense there’d be “infinite economic value everywhere”, and one might imagine there’d be “no competition left”.</p>\n<p>But once again computational irreducibility stands in the way. Because it tells us there’ll never be “infinite automation”, just as there’ll never be an ultimate winning biological organism. There’ll always be “more to explore” in the computational universe, and different paths to follow. </p>\n<p>What will this look like in practice? Presumably it’ll lead to all sorts of diversity. So that, for example, a chart of “what the components of an economy are” will become more and more fragmented; it won’t just be “the single winning economic activity is ___”. </p>\n<p>There is one potential wrinkle in this picture of unending progress. What if nobody cares? What if the innovations and discoveries just don’t matter, say to us humans? And, yes, there is of course plenty in the world that at any given time in history we don’t care about. That piece of silicon we’ve been able to pick out? It’s just part of a rock. Well, until we start making microprocessors out of it. </p>\n<p>But as we’ve discussed, as soon as we’re “operating at some level of abstraction” computational irreducibility makes it inevitable that we’ll eventually be exposed to things that “require going beyond that level”. </p>\n<p>But then—critically—there will be choices. There will be different paths to explore (or “mine”) in the computational universe—in the end infinitely many of them. And whatever the computational resources of AIs etc. might be, they’ll never be able to explore all of them. So something—or someone—will have to make a choice of which ones to take.</p>\n<p>Given a particular set of things one cares about at a particular point, one might successfully be able to automate all of them. But computational irreducibility implies there will always be a “frontier”, where choices have to be made. And there’s no “right answer”; no “theoretically derivable” conclusion. Instead, if we humans are involved, this is where we get to define what’s going to happen.</p>\n<p>How will we do that? Well, ultimately it’ll be based on our history—biological, cultural, etc. We’ll get to use all that irreducible computation that went into getting us to where we are to define what to do next. In a sense it’ll be something that goes “through us”, and that uses what we are. It’s the place where—even when there’s automation all around—there’s still always something us humans can “meaningfully” do.</p>\n<h2 id='how-can-we-tell-the-ais-what-to-do?'>How Can We Tell the AIs What to Do?</h2>\n<p>Let’s say we want an AI (or any computational system) to do a particular thing. We might think we could just set up its rules (or “program it”) to do that thing. And indeed for certain kinds of tasks that works just fine. But the deeper the use we make of computation, the more we’re going to run into computational irreducibility, and the less we’ll be able to know how to set up particular rules to achieve what we want.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, there’s the question of defining what “we want” in the first place. Yes, we could have specific rules that say what particular pattern of bits should occur at a particular point in a computation. But that probably won’t have much to do with the kind of overall “human-level” objective that we typically care about. And indeed for any objective we can even reasonably define, we’d better be able to coherently “form a thought” about it. Or, in effect, we’d better have some “human-level narrative” to describe it. </p>\n<p>But how can we represent such a narrative? Well, we have natural language—probably the single most important innovation in the history of our species. And what natural language fundamentally does is to allow us to talk about things at a “human level”. It’s made of words that we can think of as representing “human-level packets of meaning”. And so, for example, the word “chair” represents the human-level concept of a chair. It’s not referring to some particular arrangement of atoms. Instead, it’s referring to any arrangement of atoms that we can usefully conflate into the single human-level concept of a chair, and from which we can deduce things like the fact that we can expect to sit on it, etc.</p>\n<p>So, OK, when we’re “talking to an AI” can we expect to just say what we want using natural language? We can definitely get a certain distance—and indeed ChatGPT helps us get further than ever before. But as we try to make things more precise we run into trouble, and the language we need rapidly becomes increasingly ornate, as in the “legalese” of complex legal documents. So what can we do? If we’re going to keep things at the level of “human thoughts” we can’t “reach down” into all the computational details. But yet we want a precise definition of how what we might say can be implemented in terms of those computational details.</p>\n<p>Well, there’s a way to deal with this, and it’s one that I’ve personally devoted many decades to: it’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>the idea of computational language</a>. When we think about programming languages, they’re things that operate solely at the level of computational details, defining in more or less the native terms of a computer what the computer should do. But the point of a true computational language (and, yes, in the world today the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> is the sole example) is to do something different: to define a precise way of talking in computational terms about things in the world (whether concretely countries or minerals, or abstractly computational or mathematical structures). </p>\n<p>Out in the computational universe, there’s immense diversity in the “raw computation” that can happen. But there’s only a thin sliver of it that we humans (at least currently) care about and think about. And we can view computational language as defining a bridge between the things we think about and what’s computationally possible. The <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/'>functions in our computational language</a> (7000 or so of them in the Wolfram Language) are in effect like words in a human language—but now they have a precise grounding in the “bedrock” of explicit computation. And the point is to <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/' target=_blank rel=noopener>design the computational language</a> so it’s convenient for us humans to think and express ourselves in (like a vastly expanded analog of mathematical notation), but so it can also be precisely implemented in practice on a computer.</p>\n<p>Given a piece of natural language it’s often possible to give a precise, computational interpretation of it—in computational language. And indeed this is exactly what happens in Wolfram|Alpha. Give a piece of natural language and the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/natural-language-understanding/'>Wolfram|Alpha NLU system</a> will try to find an interpretation of it as computational language. And from this interpretation, it’s then up to the Wolfram Language to do the computation that’s specified, and give back the results—and potentially synthesize natural language to express them. </p>\n<p>As a practical matter, this setup is useful not only for humans, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/'>but also for AIs—like ChatGPT</a>. Given a system that produces natural language, the Wolfram|Alpha NLU system can “catch” natural language it is “thrown”, and interpret it as computational language that precisely specifies a potentially irreducible computation to do.</p>\n<p>With both natural language and computational language one’s basically “directly saying what one wants”. But an alternative approach—more aligned with machine learning—is just to give examples, and (implicitly or explicitly) say “follow these”. Inevitably there <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#what-is-a-model?'>has to be some underlying model</a> for how to do that following—typically in practice just defined by “what a neural net with a certain architecture will do”. But will the result be “right”? Well, the result will be whatever the neural net gives. But typically we’ll tend to consider it “right” if it’s somehow consistent with what we humans would have concluded. And in practice <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#models-for-human-like-tasks'>this often seems to happen</a>, presumably because the actual architecture of our brains is somehow similar enough to the architecture of the neural nets we’re using.</p>\n<p>But what if we want to “know for sure” what’s going to happen—or, for example, that some particular “mistake” can never be made? Well then we’re presumably thrust back into computational irreducibility, with the result that there’s no way to know, for example, whether a particular set of training examples can lead to a system that’s capable of doing (or not doing) some particular thing.</p>\n<p>OK, but let’s say we’re setting up some AI system, and we want to make sure it “doesn’t do anything bad”. There are several levels of issues here. The first is to decide what we mean by “anything bad”. And, as we’ll discuss below, that in itself is very hard. But even if we could abstractly figure this out, how should we actually express it? We could give examples—but then the AI will inevitably have to “extrapolate” from them, in ways we can’t predict. Or we could <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>describe what we want in computational language</a>. It might be difficult to cover “every case” (as it is in present-day human laws, or complex contracts). But at least we as humans can read what we’re specifying. Though even in this case, there’s an issue of computational irreducibility: that given the specification it won’t be possible to work out all its consequences.</p>\n<p>What does all this mean? In essence it’s just a reflection of the fact that as soon as there’s “serious computation” (i.e. irreducible computation) involved, one isn’t going to be immediately able to say what will happen. (And in a sense that’s inevitable, because if one could say, it would mean the computation wasn’t in fact irreducible.) So, yes, we can try to “tell AIs what to do”. But it’ll be like many systems in nature (or, for that matter, people): you can set them on a path, but you can’t know for sure what will happen; you just have to wait and see.</p>\n<h2 id='a-world-run-by-ais'>A World Run by AIs</h2>\n<p>In the world today, there are already <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/testifying-at-the-senate-about-a-i-selected-content-on-the-internet/'>plenty of things that are being done by AIs</a>. And, as we’ve discussed, there’ll surely be more in the future. But who’s “in charge”? Are we telling the AIs what to do, or are they telling us? Today it’s at best a mixture: AIs suggest content for us (for example from the web), and in general make all sorts of recommendations about what we should do. And no doubt in the future those recommendations will be even more extensive and tightly coupled to us: we’ll be recording everything we do, processing it with AI, and continually annotating with recommendations—say through augmented reality—everything we see. And in some sense things might even go beyond “recommendations”. If we have direct neural interfaces, then we might be making our brains just “decide” they want to do things, so that in some sense we become pure “puppets of the AI”.</p>\n<p>And beyond “personal recommendations” there’s also the question of AIs running the systems we use, or in fact running the whole infrastructure of our civilization. Today we ultimately expect people to make large-scale decisions for our world—often operating in systems of rules defined by laws, and perhaps aided by computation, and even what one might call AI. But there may well come a time when it seems as if AIs could just “do a better job than humans”, say at running a central bank or waging a war.</p>\n<p>One might ask how one would ever know if the AI would “do a better job”. Well, one could try tests, and run examples. But once again one’s faced with computational irreducibility. Yes, the particular tests one tries might work fine. But one can’t ultimately predict everything that could happen. What will the AI do if there’s suddenly a never-before-seen seismic event? We basically won’t know until it happens.</p>\n<p>But can we be sure the AI won’t do anything “crazy”? Could we—with some definition of “crazy”—effectively “prove a theorem” that the AI can never do that? For any realistically nontrivial definition of crazy we’ll again run into computational irreducibility—and this won’t be possible.</p>\n<p>Of course, if we’ve put a person (or even a group of people) “in charge” there’s also no way to “prove” that they won’t do anything “crazy”—and history shows that people in charge quite often have done things that, at least in retrospect, we consider “crazy”. But even though at some level there’s no more certainty about what people will do than about what AIs might do, we still get a certain comfort when people are in charge if we think that “we’re in it together”, and that if something goes wrong those people will also “feel the effects”.</p>\n<p>But still, it seems inevitable that lots of decisions and actions in the world will be taken directly by AIs. Perhaps it’ll be because this will be cheaper. Perhaps the results (based on tests) will be better. Or perhaps, for example, things will just have to be done too quickly and in numbers too large for us humans to be in the loop.</p>\n<p>But, OK, if a lot of what happens in our world is happening through AIs, and the AIs are effectively doing irreducible computations, what will this be like? We’ll be in a situation where things are “just happening” and we don’t quite know why. But in a sense we’ve very much been in this situation before. Because it’s what happens all the time in our interaction with nature.</p>\n<p>Processes in nature—like, for example, the weather—can be thought of as corresponding to computations. And much of the time there’ll be irreducibility in those computations. So we won’t be able to readily predict them. Yes, we can do natural science to figure out some aspects of what’s going to happen. But it’ll inevitably be limited. </p>\n<p>And so we can expect it to be with the “AI infrastructure” of the world. Things are happening in it—as they are in the weather—that we can’t readily predict. We’ll be able to say some things—though perhaps in ways that are closer to psychology or social science than to traditional exact science. But there’ll be surprises—like maybe some strange AI analog of a hurricane or an ice age. And in the end all we’ll really be able to do is to try to build up our human civilization so that such things “don’t fundamentally matter” to it. </p>\n<p>In a sense the picture we have is that in time there’ll be a whole “civilization of AIs” operating—like nature—in ways that we can’t readily understand. And like with nature, we’ll coexist with it.</p>\n<p>But at least at first we might think there’s an important difference between nature and AIs. Because we imagine that we don’t “pick our natural laws”—yet insofar as we’re the ones building the AIs we imagine we can “pick their laws”. But both parts of this aren’t quite right. Because in fact one of the implications of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> is precisely that the laws of nature that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>we perceive are the way they are because we are observers who are the way we are</a>. And on the AI side, computational irreducibility implies that we can’t expect to be able to determine the final behavior of the AIs just from knowing the underlying laws we gave them.</p>\n<p>But what will the “emergent laws” of the AIs be? Well, just like in physics, it’ll depend on how we “sample” the behavior of the AIs. If we look down at the level of individual bits, it’ll be like looking at molecular dynamics (or the behavior of atoms of space). But typically we won’t do this. And just like in physics, we’ll operate as computationally bounded observers—measuring only certain aggregated features of an underlying computationally irreducible process. But what will the “overall laws of AIs” be like? Maybe they’ll show close analogies to physics. Or maybe they’ll seem more like psychological theories (superegos for AIs?). But we can expect them in many ways to be like large-scale laws of nature of the kind we know.</p>\n<p>Still, there’s one more difference between at least our interaction with nature and with AIs. Because we have in effect been “co-evolving” with nature for billions of years—yet AIs are “new on the scene”. And through our co-evolution with nature we’ve developed all sorts of structural, sensory and cognitive features that allow us to “interact successfully” with nature. But with AIs we don’t have these. So what does this mean?</p>\n<p>Well, our ways of interacting with nature can be thought of as leveraging pockets of computational reducibility that exist in natural processes—to make things seem at least somewhat predictable to us. But without having found such pockets for AIs, we’re likely to be faced with much more “raw computational irreducibility”—and thus much more unpredictability. It’s been a conceit of modern times that—particularly with the help of science—we’ve been able to make more and more of our world predictable to us, though in practice a large part of what’s led to this is the way we’ve built and controlled the environment in which we live, and the things we choose to do. </p>\n<p>But for the new “AI world”, we’re effectively starting from scratch. And to make things predictable in that world may be partly a matter of some new science, but perhaps more importantly a matter of choosing how we set up our “way of life” around the AIs there. (And, yes, if there’s lots of unpredictability we may be back to more ancient points of view about the importance of fate—or we may view AIs as a bit like the Olympians of Greek mythology, duking it out among themselves and sometimes having an effect on mortals.)</p>\n<h2 id='governance-in-an-ai-world'>Governance in an AI World</h2>\n<p>Let’s say the world is effectively being run by AIs, but let’s assume that we humans have at least some control over what they do. Then what principles should we have them follow? And what, for example, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>should their “ethics” be</a>?</p>\n<p>Well, the first thing to say is that there’s no ultimate, theoretical “right answer” to this. There are many ethical and other principles that AIs could follow. And it’s basically just a choice which ones should be followed. </p>\n<p>When we talk about “principles” and “ethics” we tend to think more in terms of constraints on behavior than in terms of rules for generating behavior. And that means we’re dealing with something <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/the-metamodeling-of-axiomatic-mathematics/'>more like mathematical axioms</a>, where we ask things like what theorems are true according to those axioms, and what are not. And that means there can be issues like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>whether the axioms are consistent—and whether they’re complete</a>, in the sense that they can “determine the ethics of anything”. But now, once again, we’re face to face with computational irreducibility, here in the form of Gödel’s theorem and its generalizations. </p>\n<p>And what this means is that it’s in general undecidable whether any given set of principles is inconsistent, or incomplete. One might “ask an ethical question”, and find that there’s a “proof chain” of unbounded length to determine what the answer to that question is within one’s specified ethical system, or whether there is even a consistent answer.</p>\n<p>One might imagine that somehow one could add axioms to “patch up” whatever issues there are. But Gödel’s theorem basically says that it’ll never work. It’s the same story as so often with computational irreducibility: there’ll always be “new situations” that can arise, that in this case can’t be captured by a finite set of axioms.</p>\n<p>OK, but let’s imagine we’re picking a collection of principles for AIs. What criteria could we use to do it? One might be that these principles won’t inexorably lead to a simple state—like one where the AIs are extinct, or have to keep looping doing the same thing forever. And there may be cases where one can readily see that some set of principles will lead to such outcomes. But most of the time, computational irreducibility (here in the form of things like the halting problem) will once again get in the way, and one won’t be able to tell what will happen, or successfully pick “viable principles” this way.</p>\n<p>So this means that there are going to be a wide range of principles that we could in theory pick. But presumably what we’ll want is to pick ones that make AIs give us humans some sort of “good time”, whatever that might mean. </p>\n<p>And a minimal idea might be to get AIs just to observe what we humans do, and then somehow imitate this. But most people wouldn’t consider this the right thing. They’d point out all the “bad” things people do. And they’d perhaps say “let’s have the AIs follow not what we actually do, but what we aspire to do”. </p>\n<p>But where should we get these aspirations from? Different people, and different cultures, can have very different aspirations—with very different resulting principles. So whose should we pick? And, yes, there are pitifully few—if any—principles that we truly find in common everywhere. (Though, for example, the major religions all tend to share things like respect for human life, the Golden Rule, etc.) </p>\n<p>But do we in fact have to pick one set of principles? Maybe some AIs can have some principles, and some can have others. Maybe it should be like different countries, or different online communities: different principles for different groups or in different places. </p>\n<p>Right now that doesn’t seem plausible, because technological and commercial forces have tended to make it seem as if powerful AIs always have to be centralized. But I expect that this is just a feature of the present time, and not something intrinsic to any “human-like” AI. </p>\n<p>So could everyone (and maybe every organization) have “their own AI” with its own principles? For some purposes this might work OK. But there are many situations where AIs (or people) can’t really act independently, and where there have to be “collective decisions” made.</p>\n<p>Why is this? In some cases it’s because everyone is in the same physical environment. In other cases it’s because if there’s to be social cohesion—of the kind needed to support even something like a language that’s useful for communication—then there has to be certain conceptual alignment. </p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out, though, that at some level having a “collective conclusion” is effectively just a way of introducing certain computational reducibility to make it “easier to see what to do”. And potentially it can be avoided if one has enough computation capability. For example, one might assume that there has to be a collective conclusion about which side of the road cars should drive on. But that wouldn’t be true if every car had the computation capability to just compute a trajectory that would for example optimally weave around other cars using both sides of the road. </p>\n<p>But if we humans are going to be in the loop, we presumably need a certain amount of computational reducibility to make our world sufficiently comprehensible to us that we can operate in it. So that means there’ll be collective—“societal”—decisions to make. We might want to just tell the AIs to “make everything as good as it can be for us”. But inevitably there will be tradeoffs. Making a collective decision one way might be really good for 99% of people, but really bad for 1%; making it the other way might be pretty good for 60%, but pretty bad for 40%. So what should the AI do?</p>\n<p>And, of course, this is a classic problem of political philosophy, and there’s no “right answer”. And in reality the setup won’t be as clean as this. It may be fairly easy to work out some immediate effects of different courses of action. But inevitably one will eventually run into computational irreducibility—and “unintended consequences”—and so one won’t be able to say with certainty what the ultimate effects (good or bad) will be.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so how should one actually make collective decisions? There’s no perfect answer, but in the world today, democracy in one form or another is usually viewed as the best option. So how might AI affect democracy—and perhaps improve on it? Let’s assume first that “humans are still in charge”, so that it’s ultimately their preferences that matter. (And let’s also assume that humans are more or less in their “current form”: unique and unreplicable discrete entities that believe they have independent minds.)</p>\n<p>The basic setup for current democracy is computationally quite simple: discrete votes (or perhaps rankings) are given (sometimes with weights of various kinds), and then numerical totals are used to determine the winner (or winners). And with past technology this was pretty much all that could be done. But now there are some new elements. Imagine not casting discrete votes, but instead using computational language to write a computational essay to describe one’s preferences. Or imagine having a conversation with a linguistically enabled AI that can draw out and debate one’s preferences, and eventually summarize them in some kind of feature vector. Then imagine feeding computational essays or feature vectors from all “voters” to some AI that “works out the best thing to do”.</p>\n<p>Well, there are still the same political philosophy issues. It’s not like 60% of people voted for A and 40% for B, so one chose A. It’s much more nuanced. But one still won’t be able to make everyone happy all the time, and one has to have some base principles to know what to do about that. </p>\n<p>And there’s a higher-order problem in having an AI “rebalance” collective decisions all the time based on everything it knows about people’s detailed preferences (and perhaps their actions too): for many purposes—like us being able to “keep track of what’s going on”—it’s important to maintain consistency over time. But, yes, one could deal with this by having the AI somehow also weigh consistency in figuring out what to do.</p>\n<p>But while there are no doubt ways in which AI can “tune up” democracy, AI doesn’t seem—in and of itself—to deliver any fundamentally new solution for making collective decisions, and for governance in general.</p>\n<p>And indeed, in the end things always seem to come down to needing some fundamental set of principles about how one wants things to be. Yes, AIs can be the ones to implement these principles. But there are many possibilities for what the principles could be. And—at least if we humans are “in charge”—we’re the ones who are going to have to come up with them.</p>\n<p>Or, in other words, we need to come up with some kind of “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>AI constitution</a>”. Presumably this constitution should basically be written in precise computational language (and, yes, we’re trying to make it possible for the Wolfram Language to be used), but inevitably (as yet another consequence of computational irreducibility) there’ll be “fuzzy” definitions and distinctions, that will rely on things like examples, “interpolated” by systems like neural nets. Maybe when such a constitution is created, there’ll be multiple “renderings” of it, which can all be applied whenever the constitution is used, with some mechanism for picking the “overall conclusion”. (And, yes, there’s potentially a certain <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>“observer-dependent” multicomputational character</a> to this.)</p>\n<p>But whatever its detailed mechanisms, what should the AI constitution say? Different people and groups of people will definitely come to different conclusions about it. And presumably—just as there are different countries, etc. today with different systems of laws—there’ll be different groups that want to adopt different AI constitutions. (And, yes, the same issues about collective decision making apply again when those AI constitutions have to interact.)</p>\n<p>But given an AI constitution, one has a base on which AIs can make decisions. And on top of this one imagines a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/a-world-run-with-code/'>huge network of computational contracts</a> that are autonomously executed, essentially to “run the world”. </p>\n<p>And this is perhaps one of those classic “what could possibly go wrong?” moments. An AI constitution has been agreed on, and now everything is being run efficiently and autonomously by AIs that are following it. Well, once again, computational irreducibility rears its head. Because however carefully the AI constitution is drafted, computational irreducibility implies that one won’t be able to foresee all its consequences: “unexpected” things will always happen—and some of them will undoubtedly be things “one doesn’t like”.</p>\n<p>In human legal systems there’s always a mechanism for adding “patches”—filling in laws or precedents that cover new situations that have come up. But if everything is being autonomously run by AIs there’s no room for that. Yes, we as humans might characterize “bad things that happen” as “bugs” that could be fixed by adding a patch. But the AI is just supposed to be operating—essentially axiomatically—according to its constitution, so it has no way to “see that it’s a bug”. </p>\n<p>Similar to what we discussed above, there’s an interesting analogy here with human law versus natural law. Human law is something we define and can modify. Natural law is something the universe just provides us (notwithstanding the issues about observers discussed above). And by “setting an AI constitution and letting it run” we’re basically forcing ourselves into a situation where the “civilization of the AIs” is some “independent stratum” in the world, that we essentially have to take as it is, and adapt to.</p>\n<p>Of course, one might wonder if the AI constitution could “automatically evolve”, say based on what’s actually seen to happen in the world. But one quickly returns to the exact same issues of computational irreducibility, where one can’t predict whether the evolution will be “right”, etc.</p>\n<p>So far, we’ve assumed that in some sense “humans are in charge”. But at some level that’s an issue for the AI constitution to define. It’ll have to define whether AIs have “independent rights”—just like humans (and, in many legal systems, some other entities too). Closely related to the question of independent rights for AIs is whether an AI can be considered autonomously “responsible for its actions”—or whether such responsibility must always ultimately rest with the (presumably human) creator or “programmer” of the AI. </p>\n<p>Once again, computational irreducibility has something to say. Because it implies that the behavior of the AI can go “irreducibly beyond” what its programmer defined. And in the end (as we discussed above) this is the same basic mechanism that allows us humans to effectively have “free will” even when we’re ultimately operating according to deterministic underlying natural laws. So if we’re going to claim that we humans have free will, and can be “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-7--responsibility-and-free-will/'>responsible for our actions</a>” (as opposed to having our actions always “dictated by underlying laws”) then we’d better claim the same for AIs.</p>\n<p>So just as a human builds up something irreducible and irreplaceable in the course of their life, so can an AI. As a practical matter, though, AIs can presumably be backed up, copied, etc.—which isn’t (yet) possible for humans. So somehow their individual instances don’t seem as valuable, even if the “last copy” might still be valuable. As humans, we might want to say “those AIs are something inferior; they shouldn’t have rights”. But things are going to get more entangled. Imagine a bot that no longer has an identifiable owner but that’s successfully befriending people (say on social media), and paying for its underlying operation from donations, ads, etc. Can we reasonably delete that bot? We might argue that “the bot can feel no pain”—but that’s not true of its human friends. But what if the bot starts doing “bad” things? Well, then we’ll need some form of “bot justice”—and pretty soon we’ll find ourselves building a whole human-like legal structure for the AIs.</p>\n<h2 id='so-will-it-end-badly?'>So Will It End Badly?</h2>\n<p>OK, so AIs will learn what they can from us humans, then they’ll fundamentally just be running as autonomous computational systems—much like nature runs as an autonomous computational system—sometimes “interacting with us”. What will they “do to us”? Well, what does nature “do to us”? In a kind of animistic way, we might attribute intentions to nature, but ultimately it’s just “following its rules” and doing what it does. And so it will be with AIs. Yes, we might think we can set things up to determine what the AIs will do. But in the end—insofar as the AIs are really making use of what’s possible in the computational universe—there’ll inevitably be computational irreducibility, and we won’t be able to foresee what will happen, or what consequences it will have.</p>\n<p>So will the dynamics of AIs in fact have “bad” effects—like, for example, wiping us out? Well, it’s perfectly possible nature could wipe us out too. But one has the feeling that—extraterrestrial “accidents” aside—the natural world around us is at some level enough in some kind of “equilibrium” that nothing too dramatic will happen. But AIs are something new. So maybe they’ll be different.</p>\n<p>And one possibility might be that AIs could “improve themselves” to produce a single “apex intelligence” that would in a sense dominate everything else. But here we can see computational irreducibility as coming to the rescue. Because it implies that there can never be a “best at everything” computational system. It’s a core result of the emerging field of metabiology: that whatever “achievement” you specify, there’ll always be a computational system somewhere out there in the computational universe that will exceed it. (A simple example is that there’s always a Turing machine that can be found that will <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--longest-halting-times-in-turing-machines/'>exceed any upper bound you specify</a> on the time it takes to halt.)</p>\n<p>So what this means is that there’ll inevitably be a whole “ecosystem” of AIs—with no single winner. Of course, while that might be an inevitable final outcome, it might not be what happens in the shorter term. And indeed the current tendency to centralize AI systems has a certain danger of AI behavior becoming “unstabilized” relative to what it would be with a whole ecosystem of “AIs in equilibrium”.</p>\n<p>And in this situation there’s another potential concern as well. We humans are the product of a long struggle for life played out over the course of the history of biological evolution. And insofar as AIs inherit our attributes we might expect them to inherit a certain “drive to win”—perhaps also against us. And perhaps this is where the AI constitution becomes important: to define a “contract” that supersedes what AIs might “naturally” inherit from effectively observing our behavior. Eventually we can expect the AIs to “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>independently reach equilibrium</a>”. But in the meantime, the AI constitution can help break their connection with our “competitive” history of biological evolution. </p>\n<h2 id='preparing-for-an-ai-world'>Preparing for an AI World</h2>\n<p>We’ve talked quite a bit about the ultimate future course of AIs, and their relation to us humans. But what about the short term? How today can we prepare for the growing capabilities and uses of AIs?</p>\n<p>As has been true throughout history, people who use tools tend to do better than those who don’t. Yes, you can go on doing by direct human effort what has now been successfully automated, but except in rare cases you’ll increasingly be left behind. And what’s now emerging is an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/'>extremely powerful combination</a> of tools: neural-net-style AI for “immediate human-like tasks”, along with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a> for deeper access to the computational universe and computational knowledge. </p>\n<p>So what should people do with this? The highest leverage will come from figuring out new possibilities—things that weren’t possible before but have now “come into range” as a result of new capabilities. And as we discussed above, this is a place where we humans are inevitably central contributors—because we’re the ones who must define what we consider has value for us. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean for education? What’s worth learning now that so much has been automated? I think the fundamental answer is how to think as broadly and deeply as possible—calling on as much knowledge and as many paradigms as possible, and particularly making use of the computational paradigm, and ways of thinking about things that directly connect with what computation can help with.</p>\n<p>In the course of human history a lot of knowledge has been accumulated. But as ways of thinking have advanced, it’s become unnecessary to learn directly that knowledge in all its detail: instead one can learn things at a higher level, abstracting out many of the specific details. But in the past few decades something fundamentally new has come on the scene: computers and the things they enable. </p>\n<p>For the first time in history, it’s become realistic to truly automate intellectual tasks. The leverage this provides is completely unprecedented. And we’re only just starting to come to terms with what it means for what and how we should learn. But with all this new power there’s a tendency to think something must be lost. Surely it must still be worth learning all those intricate details—that people in the past worked so hard to figure out—of how to do some mathematical calculation, even though <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> has been able to do it automatically for more than a third of a century? </p>\n<p>And, yes, at the right time it can be interesting to learn those details. But in the effort to understand and best make use of the intellectual achievements of our civilization, it makes much more sense to leverage the automation we have, and treat those calculations just as “building blocks” that can be put together in “finished form” to do whatever it is we want to do.</p>\n<p>One might think this kind of leveraging of automation would just be important for “practical purposes”, and for applying knowledge in the real world. But actually—as I have personally <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/'>found repeatedly to great benefit</a> over the decades—it’s also crucial at a conceptual level. Because it’s only through automation that one can get enough examples and experience that one’s able to develop the intuition needed to reach a higher level of understanding.</p>\n<p>Confronted with the rapidly growing amount of knowledge in the world there’s been a tremendous tendency to assume that people must inevitably become more and more specialized. But with increasing success in the automation of intellectual tasks—and what we might broadly call AI—it becomes clear there’s an alternative: to make more and more use of this automation, so people can operate at a higher level, “integrating” rather than specializing.</p>\n<p>And in a sense this is the way to make the best use of our human capabilities: to let us concentrate on setting the “strategy” of what we want to do—delegating the details of how to do it to automated systems that can do it better than us. But, by the way, the very fact that there’s an AI that knows how to do something will no doubt make it easier for humans to learn how to do it too. Because—although we don’t yet have the complete story—it seems inevitable that with modern techniques AIs will be able to successfully “learn how people learn”, and effectively present things an AI “knows” in just the right way for any given person to absorb.</p>\n<p>So what should people actually learn? Learn how to use tools to do things. But also learn what things are out there to do—and learn facts to anchor how you think about those things. A lot of education today is about answering questions. But for the future—with AI in the picture—what’s likely to be more important is to learn how to ask questions, and how to figure out what questions are worth asking. Or, in effect, how to lay out an “intellectual strategy” for what to do.</p>\n<p>And to be successful at this, what’s going to be important is breadth of knowledge—and clarity of thinking. And when it comes to clarity of thinking, there’s again something new in modern times: the concept of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/'>computational thinking</a>. In the past we’ve had things like logic, and mathematics, as ways to structure thinking. But now we have something new: computation.</p>\n<p>Does that mean everyone should “learn to program” in some traditional programming language? No. Traditional programming languages are about telling computers what to do in their terms. And, yes, lots of humans do this today. But it’s something that’s fundamentally ripe for direct automation (as examples with ChatGPT already show). And what’s important for the long term is something different. It’s to use the computational paradigm as a structured way to think not about the operation of computers, but about both things in the world and abstract things.</p>\n<p>And crucial to this is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>having a computational language</a>: a language for expressing things using the computational paradigm. It’s perfectly possible to express simple “everyday things” in plain, unstructured natural language. But to build any kind of serious “conceptual tower” one needs something more structured. And that’s what computational language is about.</p>\n<p>One can see a rough historical analog in the development of mathematics and mathematical thinking. Up until about half a millennium ago, mathematics basically had to be expressed in natural language. But then came mathematical notation—and from it a more streamlined approach to mathematical thinking, that eventually made possible all the various mathematical sciences. And it’s now the same kind of thing with computational language and the computational paradigm. Except that it’s a much broader story, in which for basically every field or occupation “X” there’s a “computational X” that’s emerging.</p>\n<p>In a sense the point of computational language (and all my efforts in the development of the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>) is to be able to let people get “as automatically as possible” to computational X—and to let people express themselves using the full power of the computational paradigm. </p>\n<p>Something like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/'>ChatGPT provides “human-like AI”</a> in effect by piecing together existing human material (like billions of words of human-written text). But computational language lets one tap directly into computation—and gives the ability to do fundamentally new things, that immediately leverage our human capabilities for defining intellectual strategy.</p>\n<p>And, yes, while traditional programming is likely to be largely obsoleted by AI, computational language is something that provides a permanent bridge between human thinking and the computational universe: a channel in which the automation is already done in the very design (and implementation) of the language—leaving in a sense an interface directly suitable for humans to learn, and to use as a basis to extend their thinking.</p>\n<p>But, OK, what about the future of discovery? Will AIs take over from us humans in, for example, “doing science”? I, for one, have used computation (and many things one might think of as AI) as a tool for scientific discovery for nearly half a century. And, yes, many of my discoveries have in effect been “made by computer”. But science is ultimately about connecting things to human understanding. And so far it’s taken a human to knit what the computer finds into the whole web of human intellectual history. </p>\n<p>One can certainly imagine, though, that an AI—even one rather like ChatGPT—could be quite successful in taking a “raw computational discovery” and “explaining” how it might relate to existing human knowledge. One could also imagine that the AI would be successful at identifying what aspects of some system in the world could be picked out to describe in some formal way. But—as is typical for the process of modeling in general—a key step is to decide “what one cares about”, and in effect in what direction to go in extending one’s science. And this—like so much else—is inevitably tied into the specifics of the goals we humans set ourselves.</p>\n<p>In the emerging AI world there are plenty of specific skills that won’t make sense for (most) humans to learn—just as today the advance of automation has obsoleted many skills from the past. But—as we’ve discussed—we can expect there to “be a place” for humans. And what’s most important for us humans to learn is in effect how to pick “where next to go”—and where, out of all the infinite possibilities in the computational universe, we should take human civilization.</p>\n<h2 id='afterword:-looking-at-some-actual-data'>Afterword: Looking at Some Actual Data</h2>\n<p>OK, so we’ve talked quite a bit about what might happen in the future. But what about <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/society-and-culture/economic-data'>actual data from the past</a>? For example, what’s been the actual history of the evolution of jobs? Conveniently, in the US, the <a href='https://www.census.gov/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Census Bureau</a> has records of people’s occupations going back to 1850. Of course, many job titles have changed since then. Switchmen (on railroads), chainmen (in surveying) and sextons (in churches) aren’t really things anymore. And telemarketers, aircraft pilots and web developers weren’t things in 1850. But with a bit of effort, it’s possible to more or less match things up—at least if one aggregates into large enough categories. </p>\n<p>So here are pie charts of different job categories at 50-year intervals:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img1a_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img1a.png' alt='' title='' width='620' height=''> </div>\n</div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>And, yes, in 1850 the US was firmly an agricultural economy, with just over half of all jobs being in agriculture. But as agriculture got more efficient—with the introduction of machinery, irrigation, better seeds, fertilizers, etc.—the fraction dropped dramatically, to just a few percent today. </p>\n<p>After agriculture, the next biggest category back in 1850 was construction (along with other real-estate-related jobs, mainly maintenance). And this is a category that for a century and a half hasn’t changed much in size (at least so far), presumably because, even though there’s been greater automation, this has just allowed buildings to be more complex.</p>\n<p>Looking at the pie charts above, we can see a clear trend towards greater diversification in jobs (and indeed the same thing is seen in the development of other economies around the world). It’s an old theory in economics that increasing specialization is related to economic growth, but from our point of view here, we might say that the very possibility of a more complex economy, with more niches and jobs, is a reflection of the inevitable presence of computational irreducibility, and the complex web of pockets of computational reducibility that it implies. </p>\n<p>Beyond the overall distribution of job categories, we can also look at trends in individual categories over time—with each one in a sense providing a certain window onto history:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img2-1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/04/sw031523img2A-1.png' alt='' title='' width='620' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>One can definitely see cases where the number of jobs decreases as a result of automation. And this happens not only in areas like agriculture and mining, but also for example in finance (fewer clerks and bank tellers), as well as in sales and retail (online shopping). Sometimes—as in the case of manufacturing—there’s a decrease of jobs partly because of automation, and partly because the jobs move out of the US (mainly to countries with lower labor costs). </p>\n<p>There are cases—like military jobs—where there are clear “exogenous” effects. And then there are cases like transportation+logistics where there’s a steady increase for more than half a century as technology spreads and infrastructure gets built up—but then things “saturate”, presumably at least partly as a result of increased automation. It’s a somewhat similar story with what I’ve called “technical operations”—with more “tending to technology” needed as technology becomes more widespread.</p>\n<p>Another clear trend is an increase in job categories associated with the world becoming an “organizationally more complicated place”. Thus we see increases in management, as well as administration, government, finance and sales (which all have recent decreases as a result of computerization). And there’s also a (somewhat recent) increase in legal. </p>\n<p>Other areas with increases include healthcare, engineering, science and education—where “more is known and there’s more to do” (as well as there being increased organizational complexity). And then there’s entertainment, and food+hospitality, with increases that one might attribute to people leading (and wanting) “more complex lives”. And, of course, there’s information technology which takes off from nothing in the mid-1950s (and which had to be rather awkwardly grafted into the data we’re using here).</p>\n<p>So what can we conclude? The data seems quite well aligned with what we discussed in more general terms above. Well-developed areas get automated and need to employ fewer people. But technology also opens up new areas, which employ additional people. And—as we might expect from computational irreducibility—things generally get progressively more complicated, with additional knowledge and organizational structure opening up more “frontiers” where people are needed. But even though there are sometimes “sudden inventions”, it still always seems to take decades (or effectively a generation) for there to be any dramatic change in the number of jobs. (The few sharp changes visible in the plots seem mostly to be associated with specific economic events, and—often related—changes in government policies.)</p>\n<p>But in addition to the different jobs that get done, there’s also the question of how individual people spend their time each day. And—while it certainly doesn’t live up to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/'>my own (rather extreme) level of personal analytics</a>—there’s a certain amount of data on this that’s been collected over the years (by getting time diaries from randomly sampled people) in the <a href='https://www.ahtusdata.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>American Heritage Time Use Study</a>. So here, for example, are plots based on this survey for how the amount of time spent on different broad activities has varied over the decades (the main line shows the mean—in hours—for each activity; the shaded areas indicate successive deciles):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img3-1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img3-1.png' alt='' title='' width='620' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, people are spending more time on “media &#038; computing”, some mixture of watching TV, playing videogames, etc. Housework, at least for women, takes less time, presumably mostly as a result of automation (appliances, etc.). (“Leisure” is basically “hanging out” as well as hobbies and social, cultural, sporting events, etc.; “Civic” includes volunteer, religious, etc. activities.) </p>\n<p>If one looks specifically at people who are doing paid work</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img4-1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img4.png' alt='' title='' width='620' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>one notices several things. First, the average number of hours worked hasn’t changed much in half a century, though the distribution has broadened somewhat. For people doing paid work, media &#038; computing hasn’t increased significantly, at least since the 1980s. One category in which there is systematic increase (though the total time still isn’t very large) is exercise. </p>\n<p>What about people who—for one reason or another—aren’t doing paid work? Here are corresponding results in this case:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img5-1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw031523img5.png' alt='' title='' width='620' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Not so much increase in exercise (though the total times are larger to begin with), but now a significant increase in media &#038; computing, with the average recently reaching nearly 6 hours per day for men—perhaps as a reflection of “more of life going online”.</p>\n<p>But looking at all these results on time use, I think the main conclusion that over the past half century, the ways people (at least in the US) spend their time have remained rather stable—even as we’ve gone from a world with almost no computers to a world in which there are more computers than people.</p>\n",

But how does it do it? And why does it work? My purpose here is to give a rough outline of what&#8217;s going on inside ChatGPT—and then to explore why it is that it can do so well in producing what we might consider to be meaningful text. I should say at the outset that I&#8217;m going to focus on the big picture of what&#8217;s going on—and while I&#8217;ll mention some engineering details, I won&#8217;t get deeply into them. (And the essence of what I&#8217;ll say applies just as well to other current &#8220;large language models&#8221; [LLMs] as to ChatGPT.)</p>\n<p>The first thing to explain is that what ChatGPT is always fundamentally trying to do is to produce a &#8220;reasonable continuation&#8221; of whatever text it&#8217;s got so far, where by &#8220;reasonable&#8221; we mean &#8220;what one might expect someone to write after seeing what people have written on billions of webpages, etc.&#8221;<span id=\"more-45835\"></span></p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ve got the text &#8220;<em>The best thing about AI is its ability to</em>&#8221;. Imagine scanning billions of pages of human-written text (say on the web and in digitized books) and finding all instances of this text—then seeing what word comes next what fraction of the time. ChatGPT effectively does something like this, except that (as I&#8217;ll explain) it doesn&#8217;t look at literal text; it looks for things that in a certain sense &#8220;match in meaning&#8221;. But the end result is that it produces a ranked list of words that might follow, together with &#8220;probabilities&#8221;:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img1_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img1.png' alt='' title='' width='453' height='137'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And the remarkable thing is that when ChatGPT does something like write an essay what it&#8217;s essentially doing is just asking over and over again &#8220;given the text so far, what should the next word be?&#8221;—and each time adding a word. (More precisely, as I&#8217;ll explain, it&#8217;s adding a &#8220;token&#8221;, which could be just a part of a word, which is why it can sometimes &#8220;make up new words&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>But, OK, at each step it gets a list of words with probabilities. But which one should it actually pick to add to the essay (or whatever) that it&#8217;s writing? One might think it should be the &#8220;highest-ranked&#8221; word (i.e. the one to which the highest &#8220;probability&#8221; was assigned). But this is where a bit of voodoo begins to creep in. Because for some reason—that maybe one day we&#8217;ll have a scientific-style understanding of—if we always pick the highest-ranked word, we&#8217;ll typically get a very &#8220;flat&#8221; essay, that never seems to &#8220;show any creativity&#8221; (and even sometimes repeats word for word). But if sometimes (at random) we pick lower-ranked words, we get a &#8220;more interesting&#8221; essay.</p>\n<p>The fact that there&#8217;s randomness here means that if we use the same prompt multiple times, we&#8217;re likely to get different essays each time. And, in keeping with the idea of voodoo, there&#8217;s a particular so-called &#8220;temperature&#8221; parameter that determines how often lower-ranked words will be used, and for essay generation, it turns out that a &#8220;temperature&#8221; of 0.8 seems best. (It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that there&#8217;s no &#8220;theory&#8221; being used here; it&#8217;s just a matter of what&#8217;s been found to work in practice. And for example the concept of &#8220;temperature&#8221; is there because exponential distributions <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#textbook-thermodynamics\">familiar from statistical physics</a> happen to be being used, but there&#8217;s no &#8220;physical&#8221; connection—at least so far as we know.)</p>\n<p>Before we go on I should explain that for purposes of exposition I&#8217;m mostly not going to use the <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\">full system that&#8217;s in ChatGPT</a>; instead I&#8217;ll usually work with a simpler <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/GPT2-Transformer-Trained-on-WebText-Data/\">GPT-2 system</a>, which has the nice feature that it&#8217;s small enough to be able to run on a standard desktop computer. And so for essentially everything I show I&#8217;ll be able to include explicit <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> code that you can immediately run on your computer. (Click any picture here to copy the code behind it.)</p>\n<p>For example, here&#8217;s how to get the table of probabilities above. First, we have to <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository\">retrieve the underlying &#8220;language model&#8221; neural net</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img2_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img2.png' alt='' title='' width='466' height='123'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Later on, we&#8217;ll look inside this neural net, and talk about how it works.

OK, so now instead of generating our &#8220;words&#8221; a single letter at a time, let&#8217;s generate them looking at two letters at a time, using these &#8220;2-gram&#8221; probabilities. Here&#8217;s a sample of the result—which happens to include a few &#8220;actual words&#8221;:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img22_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img22.png' alt='' title='' width='500' height='38'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>With sufficiently much English text we can get pretty good estimates not just for probabilities of single letters or pairs of letters (2-grams), but also for longer runs of letters. And if we generate &#8220;random words&#8221; with progressively longer <em>n</em>-gram probabilities, we see that they get progressively &#8220;more realistic&#8221;:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img23_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img23.png' alt='' title='' width='586' height='158'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But let&#8217;s now assume—more or less as ChatGPT does—that we&#8217;re dealing with whole words, not letters. There are about 40,000 <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/WordList.html\">reasonably commonly used words in English</a>. And by looking at a large corpus of English text (say a few million books, with altogether a few hundred billion words), we can get an <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/WordFrequencyData.html\">estimate of how common each word is</a>. And using this we can start generating &#8220;sentences&#8221;, in which each word is independently picked at random, with the same probability that it appears in the corpus. Here&#8217;s a sample of what we get:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img24_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img24.png' alt='' title='' width='494' height='38'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Not surprisingly, this is nonsense. So how can we do better? Just like with letters, we can start taking into account not just probabilities for single words but probabilities for pairs or longer <em>n</em>-grams of words. Doing this for pairs, here are 5 examples of what we get, in all cases starting from the word &#8220;cat&#8221;:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img25_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img25.png' alt='' title='' width='453' height='134'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s getting slightly more &#8220;sensible looking&#8221;. And we might imagine that if we were able to use sufficiently long <em>n</em>-grams we&#8217;d basically &#8220;get a ChatGPT&#8221;—in the sense that we&#8217;d get something that would generate essay-length sequences of words with the &#8220;correct overall essay probabilities&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the problem: there just isn&#8217;t even close to enough English text that&#8217;s ever been written to be able to deduce those probabilities. </p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crawl of the web</a> there might be a few hundred billion words; in books that have been digitized there might be another hundred billion words. But with 40,000 common words, even the number of possible 2-grams is already 1.6 billion—and the number of possible 3-grams is 60 trillion. So there&#8217;s no way we can estimate the probabilities even for all of these from text that&#8217;s out there. And by the time we get to &#8220;essay fragments&#8221; of 20 words, the number of possibilities is larger than the number of particles in the universe, so in a sense they could never all be written down.</p>\n<p>So what can we do? The big idea is to make a model that lets us estimate the probabilities with which sequences should occur—even though we&#8217;ve never explicitly seen those sequences in the corpus of text we&#8217;ve looked at. And at the core of ChatGPT is precisely a so-called &#8220;large language model&#8221; (LLM) that&#8217;s been built to do a good job of estimating those probabilities. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-model?\">What Is a Model?</h2>\n<p>Say you want to know (as <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_49d42xp-USMC/page/404/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Galileo did back in the late 1500s</a>) how long it&#8217;s going to take a cannon ball dropped from each floor of the Tower of Pisa to hit the ground. Well, you could just measure it in each case and make a table of the results. Or you could do what is the essence of theoretical science: make a model that gives some kind of procedure for computing the answer rather than just measuring and remembering each case.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s imagine we have (somewhat idealized) data for how long the cannon ball takes to fall from various floors:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img26_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img26.png' alt='' title='' width='274' height='149'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>How do we figure out how long it&#8217;s going to take to fall from a floor we don&#8217;t explicitly have data about? In this particular case, we can use known laws of physics to work it out. But say all we&#8217;ve got is the data, and we don&#8217;t know what underlying laws govern it. Then we might make a mathematical guess, like that perhaps we should use a straight line as a model:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img27_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img27.png' alt='' title='' width='275' height='149'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We could pick different straight lines. But this is the one that&#8217;s on average closest to the data we&#8217;re given. And from this straight line we can estimate the time to fall for any floor.</p>\n<p>How did we know to try using a straight line here? At some level we didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s mathematically simple, and we&#8217;re used to the fact that lots of data we measure turns out to be well fit by mathematically simple things. We could try something mathematically more complicated—say <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> <em>x</em> + <em>c</em> <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>—and then in this case we do better:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img29_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img29.png' alt='' title='' width='286' height='154'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Things can go quite wrong, though.

And in the case of ChatGPT, lots of such &#8220;knobs&#8221; are used—actually, 175 billion of them.</p>\n<p>But the remarkable thing is that the underlying structure of ChatGPT—with &#8220;just&#8221; that many parameters—is sufficient to make a model that computes next-word probabilities &#8220;well enough&#8221; to give us reasonable essay-length pieces of text.</p>\n<h2 id=\"models-for-human-like-tasks\">Models for Human-Like Tasks</h2>\n<p>The example we gave above involves making a model for numerical data that essentially comes from simple physics—where we&#8217;ve known for several centuries that &#8220;simple mathematics applies&#8221;. But for ChatGPT we have to make a model of human-language text of the kind produced by a human brain. And for something like that we don&#8217;t (at least yet) have anything like &#8220;simple mathematics&#8221;. So what might a model of it be like?</p>\n<p>Before we talk about language, let&#8217;s talk about another human-like task: recognizing images. And as a simple example of this, let&#8217;s consider images of digits (and, yes, this is a <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/050b1a0a-f43a-4c28-b7e0-72607a918467/\">classic machine learning example</a>):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img34_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img34.png' alt='' title='' width='397' height='56'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>One thing we could do is get a bunch of sample images for each digit:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img35_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img35.png' alt='' title='' width='312' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Then to find out if an image we&#8217;re given as input corresponds to a particular digit we could just do an explicit pixel-by-pixel comparison with the samples we have. But as humans we certainly seem to do something better—because we can still recognize digits, even when they&#8217;re for example handwritten, and have all sorts of modifications and distortions:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img36_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/03/sw021423img36-4.png' alt='' title='' width='541' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>When we made a model for our numerical data above, we were able to take a numerical value <em>x</em> that we were given, and just compute <em>a + b x</em> for particular <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. So if we treat the gray-level value of each pixel here as some variable <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> is there some function of all those variables that—when evaluated—tells us what digit the image is of? It turns out that it&#8217;s possible to construct such a function. Not surprisingly, it&#8217;s not particularly simple, though. And a typical example might involve perhaps half a million mathematical operations. </p>\n<p>But the end result is that if we feed the collection of pixel values for an image into this function, out will come the number specifying which digit we have an image of. Later, we&#8217;ll talk about how such a function can be constructed, and the idea of neural nets. But for now let&#8217;s treat the function as black box, where we feed in images of, say, handwritten digits (as arrays of pixel values) and we get out the numbers these correspond to:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img38_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img38.png' alt='' title='' width='565' height='58'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what&#8217;s really going on here? Let&#8217;s say we progressively blur a digit. For a little while our function still &#8220;recognizes&#8221; it, here as a &#8220;2&#8221;. But soon it &#8220;loses it&#8221;, and starts giving the &#8220;wrong&#8221; result:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img39_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img39.png' alt='' title='' width='528' height='58'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But why do we say it&#8217;s the &#8220;wrong&#8221; result? In this case, we know we got all the images by blurring a &#8220;2&#8221;. But if our goal is to produce a model of what humans can do in recognizing images, the real question to ask is what a human would have done if presented with one of those blurred images, without knowing where it came from.</p>\n<p>And we have a &#8220;good model&#8221; if the results we get from our function typically agree with what a human would say. And the nontrivial scientific fact is that for an image-recognition task like this we now basically know how to construct functions that do this.</p>\n<p>Can we &#8220;mathematically prove&#8221; that they work? Well, no. Because to do that we&#8217;d have to have a mathematical theory of what we humans are doing. Take the &#8220;2&#8221; image and change a few pixels. We might imagine that with only a few pixels &#8220;out of place&#8221; we should still consider the image a &#8220;2&#8221;. But how far should that go? It&#8217;s a question of <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-7--visual-perception\">human visual perception</a>. And, yes, the answer would no doubt be different for bees or octopuses—and potentially <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad\">utterly different for putative aliens</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"neural-nets\">Neural Nets</h2>\n<p>OK, so how do our typical models for tasks like <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/\">image recognition</a> actually work? The most popular—and successful—current approach uses <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/NeuralNetworks.html\">neural nets</a>. Invented—in a form remarkably close to their use today—<a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--history-of-ideas-about-thinking/\">in the 1940s</a>, neural nets can be thought of as simple idealizations of how <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--the-brain/\">brains seem to work</a>. </p>\n<p>In human brains there are about 100 billion neurons (nerve cells), each capable of producing an electrical pulse up to perhaps a thousand times a second. The neurons are connected in a complicated net, with each neuron having tree-like branches allowing it to pass electrical signals to perhaps thousands of other neurons. And in a rough approximation, whether any given neuron produces an electrical pulse at a given moment depends on what pulses it&#8217;s received from other neurons—with different connections contributing with different &#8220;weights&#8221;.</p>\n<p>When we &#8220;see an image&#8221; what&#8217;s happening is that when photons of light from the image fall on (&#8220;photoreceptor&#8221;) cells at the back of our eyes they produce electrical signals in nerve cells. These nerve cells are connected to other nerve cells, and eventually the signals go through a whole sequence of layers of neurons. And it&#8217;s in this process that we &#8220;recognize&#8221; the image, eventually &#8220;forming the thought&#8221; that we&#8217;re &#8220;seeing a 2&#8221; (and maybe in the end doing something like saying the word &#8220;two&#8221; out loud). </p>\n<p>The &#8220;black-box&#8221; function from the previous section is a &#8220;mathematicized&#8221; version of such a neural net. It happens to have 11 layers (though only 4 &#8220;core layers&#8221;):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img40_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img40A.png' alt='' title='' width='381' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing particularly &#8220;theoretically derived&#8221; about this neural net; it&#8217;s just something that—<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/LeNet-Trained-on-MNIST-Data/\">back in 1998—was constructed as a piece of engineering</a>, and found to work.

The key is the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-7--the-notion-of-attractors\">notion of attractors</a>.

Or, put a different way, if an image is somehow &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--memory-analogs-with-numerical-data/\">closer to being a 1</a>&#8221; than to being a 2, we want it to end up in the &#8220;1 place&#8221; and vice versa. </p>\n<p>As a straightforward analogy, let&#8217;s say we have certain positions in the plane, indicated by dots (in a real-life setting they might be positions of coffee shops). Then we might imagine that starting from any point on the plane we&#8217;d always want to end up at the closest dot (i.e. we&#8217;d always go to the closest coffee shop).

(The &#8220;Voronoi diagram&#8221; setup we&#8217;re showing here separates points in 2D Euclidean space; the digit recognition task can be thought of as doing something very similar—but in a 784-dimensional space formed from the gray levels of all the pixels in each image.)</p>\n<p>So how do we make a neural net &#8220;do a recognition task&#8221;? Let&#8217;s consider this very simple case:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img43_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img43.png' alt='' title='' width='128' height='128'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Our goal is to take an &#8220;input&#8221; corresponding to a position {<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>}—and then to &#8220;recognize&#8221; it as whichever of the three points it&#8217;s closest to. Or, in other words, we want the neural net to compute a function of {<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>} like:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img44_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img44.png' alt='' title='' width='570' height='217'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>So how do we do this with a neural net? Ultimately a neural net is a connected collection of idealized &#8220;neurons&#8221;—usually arranged in layers—with a simple example being:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img45_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img45.png' alt='' title='' width='199' height='241'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Each &#8220;neuron&#8221; is effectively set up to evaluate a simple numerical function. And to &#8220;use&#8221; the network, we simply feed numbers (like our coordinates <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>) in at the top, then have neurons on each layer &#8220;evaluate their functions&#8221; and feed the results forward through the network—eventually producing the final result at the bottom:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img46_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img46.png' alt='' title='' width='253' height='244'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>In the traditional (biologically inspired) setup each neuron effectively has a certain set of &#8220;incoming connections&#8221; from the neurons on the previous layer, with each connection being assigned a certain &#8220;weight&#8221; (which can be a positive or negative number). The value of a given neuron is determined by multiplying the values of &#8220;previous neurons&#8221; by their corresponding weights, then adding these up and adding a constant—and finally applying a &#8220;thresholding&#8221; (or &#8220;activation&#8221;) function. In mathematical terms, if a neuron has inputs <nobr><em>x</em> = {<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub> &#8230;}</nobr> then we compute <em>f</em>[<em>w</em> . <em>x</em> + <em>b</em>], where the weights <em>w</em> and constant <em>b</em> are generally chosen differently for each neuron in the network; the function <em>f </em>is usually the same.</p>\n<p>Computing <em>w</em> . <em>x</em> + <em>b</em> is just a matter of matrix multiplication and addition. The &#8220;activation function&#8221; <em>f</em> introduces nonlinearity (and ultimately is what leads to nontrivial behavior). Various activation functions commonly get used; here we&#8217;ll just use <tt><a href=\"http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Ramp.html\">Ramp</a></tt> (or ReLU):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img48_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img48.png' alt='' title='' width='567' height='77'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>For each task we want the neural net to perform (or, equivalently, for each overall function we want it to evaluate) we&#8217;ll have different choices of weights. (And—as we&#8217;ll discuss later—these weights are normally determined by &#8220;training&#8221; the neural net using machine learning from examples of the outputs we want.)</p>\n<p>Ultimately, every neural net just corresponds to some overall mathematical function—though it may be messy to write out. For the example above, it would be:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img49_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img49.png' alt='' title='' width='542' height='115'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The neural net of ChatGPT also just corresponds to a mathematical function like this—but effectively with billions of terms. </p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s go back to individual neurons. Here are some examples of the functions a neuron with two inputs (representing coordinates <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>) can compute with various choices of weights and constants (and <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Ramp.html\">Ramp</a></tt> as activation function):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img50_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img50.png' alt='' title='' width='499' height='115'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what about the larger network from above?

In each case, as we&#8217;ll explain later, we&#8217;re using machine learning to find the best choice of weights. Then we&#8217;re showing here what the neural net with those weights computes:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img52_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img52.png' alt='' title='' width='599' height='415'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Bigger networks generally do better at approximating the function we&#8217;re aiming for. And in the &#8220;middle of each attractor basin&#8221; we typically get exactly the answer we want. But <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--memory-analogs-with-numerical-data/\">at the boundaries</a>—where the neural net &#8220;has a hard time making up its mind&#8221;—things can be messier. </p>\n<p>With this simple mathematical-style &#8220;recognition task&#8221; it&#8217;s clear what the &#8220;right answer&#8221; is. But in the problem of recognizing handwritten digits, it&#8217;s not so clear. What if someone wrote a &#8220;2&#8221; so badly it looked like a &#8220;7&#8221;, etc.? Still, we can ask how a neural net distinguishes digits—and this gives an indication:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img53_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img53.png' alt='' title='' width='311' height='311'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Can we say &#8220;mathematically&#8221; how the network makes its distinctions? Not really. It&#8217;s just &#8220;doing what the neural net does&#8221;. But it turns out that that normally seems to agree fairly well with the distinctions we humans make. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a more elaborate example. Let&#8217;s say we have images of cats and dogs. And we have a <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/\">neural net that&#8217;s been trained to distinguish them</a>. Here&#8217;s what it might do on some examples: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img54_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img54.png' alt='' title='' width='354' height='356'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s even less clear what the &#8220;right answer&#8221; is. What about a dog dressed in a cat suit? Etc. Whatever input it’s given the neural net will generate an answer, and in a way reasonably consistent with how humans might. As I&#8217;ve said above, that&#8217;s not a fact we can &#8220;derive from first principles&#8221;. It&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s empirically been found to be true, at least in certain domains. But it&#8217;s a key reason why neural nets are useful: that they somehow capture a &#8220;human-like&#8221; way of doing things.</p>\n<p>Show yourself a picture of a cat, and ask &#8220;Why is that a cat?&#8221;. Maybe you&#8217;d start saying &#8220;Well, I see its pointy ears, etc.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not very easy to explain how you recognized the image as a cat. It&#8217;s just that somehow your brain figured that out. But for a brain there&#8217;s no way (at least yet) to &#8220;go inside&#8221; and see how it figured it out. What about for an (artificial) neural net? Well, it&#8217;s straightforward to see what each &#8220;neuron&#8221; does when you show a picture of a cat. But even to get a basic visualization is usually very difficult. </p>\n<p>In the final net that we used for the &#8220;nearest point&#8221; problem above there are 17 neurons. In the net for recognizing handwritten digits there are 2190. And in the net we&#8217;re using to recognize cats and dogs there are 60,650. Normally it would be pretty difficult to visualize what amounts to 60,650-dimensional space. But because this is a network set up to deal with images, many of its layers of neurons are organized into arrays, like the arrays of pixels it&#8217;s looking at.</p>\n<p>And if we take a typical cat image</p>\n<p><img src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img55.png' alt='Cat' title='Cat' width='123/2' height='123/2'/></p>\n<p>then we can represent the states of neurons at the first layer by a collection of derived images—many of which we can readily interpret as being things like &#8220;the cat without its background&#8221;, or &#8220;the outline of the cat&#8221;:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img56_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img56.png' alt='' title='' width='599' height='355'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>By the 10th layer it&#8217;s harder to interpret what&#8217;s going on:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img57_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img57.png' alt='' title='' width='598' height='295'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But in general we might say that the neural net is &#8220;picking out certain features&#8221; (maybe pointy ears are among them), and using these to determine what the image is of. But are those features ones for which we have names—like &#8220;pointy ears&#8221;? Mostly not. </p>\n<p>Are our brains using similar features? Mostly we don&#8217;t know. But it&#8217;s notable that the first few layers of a neural net like the one we&#8217;re showing here seem to pick out aspects of images (like edges of objects) that seem to be similar to ones we know are picked out by the first level of visual processing in brains.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s say we want a &#8220;theory of cat recognition&#8221; in neural nets. We can say: &#8220;Look, this particular net does it&#8221;—and immediately that gives us some sense of &#8220;how hard a problem&#8221; it is (and, for example, how many neurons or layers might be needed). But at least as of now we don&#8217;t have a way to &#8220;give a narrative description&#8221; of what the network is doing. And maybe that&#8217;s because it truly is computationally irreducible, and there&#8217;s no general way to find what it does except by explicitly tracing each step. Or maybe it&#8217;s just that we haven&#8217;t &#8220;figured out the science&#8221;, and identified the &#8220;natural laws&#8221; that allow us to summarize what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll encounter the same kinds of issues when we talk about generating language with ChatGPT. And again it&#8217;s not clear whether there are ways to &#8220;summarize what it&#8217;s doing&#8221;. But the richness and detail of language (and our experience with it) may allow us to get further than with images.</p>\n<h2 id=\"machine-learning,-and-the-training-of-neural-nets\">Machine Learning, and the Training of Neural Nets</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been talking so far about neural nets that &#8220;already know&#8221; how to do particular tasks. But what makes neural nets so useful (presumably also in brains) is that not only can they in principle do all sorts of tasks, but they can be incrementally &#8220;trained from examples&#8221; to do those tasks.</p>\n<p>When we make a neural net to distinguish cats from dogs we don&#8217;t effectively have to write a program that (say) explicitly finds whiskers; instead we just show lots of examples of what&#8217;s a cat and what&#8217;s a dog, and then have the network &#8220;machine learn&#8221; from these how to distinguish them.</p>\n<p>And the point is that the trained network &#8220;generalizes&#8221; from the particular examples it&#8217;s shown. Just as we&#8217;ve seen above, it isn&#8217;t simply that the network recognizes the particular pixel pattern of an example cat image it was shown; rather it&#8217;s that the neural net somehow manages to distinguish images on the basis of what we consider to be some kind of &#8220;general catness&#8221;. </p>\n<p>So how does neural net training actually work? Essentially what we&#8217;re always trying to do is to find weights that make the neural net successfully reproduce the examples we&#8217;ve given. And then we&#8217;re relying on the neural net to &#8220;interpolate&#8221; (or &#8220;generalize&#8221;) &#8220;between&#8221; these examples in a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; way.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a problem even simpler than the nearest-point one above. Let&#8217;s just try to get a neural net to learn the function: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img58_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img58.png' alt='' title='' width='203' height='124'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>For this task, we&#8217;ll need a network that has just one input and one output, like: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img59_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img59.png' alt='' title='' width='141' height='170'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But what weights, etc. should we be using? With every possible set of weights the neural net will compute some function. And, for example, here&#8217;s what it does with a few randomly chosen sets of weights: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img60_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img60.png' alt='' title='' width='597' height='209'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, we can plainly see that in none of these cases does it get even close to reproducing the function we want. So how do we find weights that will reproduce the function?</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to supply lots of &#8220;input &#8594; output&#8221; examples to &#8220;learn from&#8221;—and then to try to find weights that will reproduce these examples. Here&#8217;s the result of doing that with progressively more examples:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img61_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img61.png' alt='' title='' width='597' height='259'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At each stage in this &#8220;training&#8221; the weights in the network are progressively adjusted—and we see that eventually we get a network that successfully reproduces the function we want. So how do we adjust the weights? The basic idea is at each stage to see &#8220;how far away we are&#8221; from getting the function we want—and then to update the weights in such a way as to get closer. </p>\n<p>To find out &#8220;how far away we are&#8221; we compute what&#8217;s usually called a &#8220;loss function&#8221; (or sometimes &#8220;cost function&#8221;). Here we&#8217;re using a simple (L2) loss function that&#8217;s just the sum of the squares of the differences between the values we get, and the true values. And what we see is that as our training process progresses, the loss function progressively decreases (following a certain &#8220;learning curve&#8221; that&#8217;s different for different tasks)—until we reach a point where the network (at least to a good approximation) successfully reproduces the function we want:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img62_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img62.png' alt='' title='' width='581' height='200'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Alright, so the last essential piece to explain is how the weights are adjusted to reduce the loss function. As we&#8217;ve said, the loss function gives us a &#8220;distance&#8221; between the values we&#8217;ve got, and the true values. But the &#8220;values we&#8217;ve got&#8221; are determined at each stage by the current version of neural net—and by the weights in it. But now imagine that the weights are variables—say <em>w<sub>i</sub></em>. We want to find out how to adjust the values of these variables to minimize the loss that depends on them.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine (in an incredible simplification of typical neural nets used in practice) that we have just two weights <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>  and <em>w</em><sub>2</sub>. Then we might have a loss that as a function of <em>w</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>w</em><sub>2</sub> looks like this:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img68_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img68.png' alt='' title='' width='236' height='112'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Numerical analysis provides a variety of techniques for finding the minimum in cases like this. But a typical approach is just to progressively follow the path of steepest descent from whatever previous <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>2</sub> we had:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img71_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img71.png' alt='' title='' width='403' height='197'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Like water flowing down a mountain, all that&#8217;s guaranteed is that this procedure will end up at some local minimum of the surface (&#8220;a mountain lake&#8221;); it might well not reach the ultimate global minimum.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not obvious that it would be feasible to find the path of the steepest descent on the &#8220;weight landscape&#8221;. But calculus comes to the rescue. As we mentioned above, one can always think of a neural net as computing a mathematical function—that depends on its inputs, and its weights. But now consider differentiating with respect to these weights. It turns out that the chain rule of calculus in effect lets us &#8220;unravel&#8221; the operations done by successive layers in the neural net. And the result is that we can—at least in some local approximation—&#8220;invert&#8221; the operation of the neural net, and progressively find weights that minimize the loss associated with the output.</p>\n<p>The picture above shows the kind of minimization we might need to do in the unrealistically simple case of just 2 weights. But it turns out that even with many more weights (ChatGPT uses 175 billion) it&#8217;s still possible to do the minimization, at least to some level of approximation. And in fact the big breakthrough in &#8220;deep learning&#8221; that occurred around 2011 was associated with the discovery that in some sense it can be easier to do (at least approximate) minimization when there are lots of weights involved than when there are fairly few.</p>\n<p>In other words—somewhat counterintuitively—it can be easier to solve more complicated problems with neural nets than simpler ones. And the rough reason for this seems to be that when one has a lot of &#8220;weight variables&#8221; one has a high-dimensional space with &#8220;lots of different directions&#8221; that can lead one to the minimum—whereas with fewer variables it&#8217;s easier to end up getting stuck in a local minimum (&#8220;mountain lake&#8221;) from which there&#8217;s no &#8220;direction to get out&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that in typical cases there are many different collections of weights that will all give neural nets that have pretty much the same performance. And usually in practical neural net training there are lots of random choices made—that lead to &#8220;different-but-equivalent solutions&#8221;, like these:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img72_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img72.png' alt='' title='' width='571' height='82'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But each such &#8220;different solution&#8221; will have at least slightly different behavior. And if we ask, say, for an &#8220;extrapolation&#8221; outside the region where we gave training examples, we can get dramatically different results:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img73_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img73.png' alt='' title='' width='571' height='83'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But which of these is &#8220;right&#8221;? There&#8217;s really no way to say. They&#8217;re all &#8220;consistent with the observed data&#8221;. But they all correspond to different &#8220;innate&#8221; ways to &#8220;think about&#8221; what to do &#8220;outside the box&#8221;. And some may seem &#8220;more reasonable&#8221; to us humans than others. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-practice-and-lore-of-neural-net-training\">The Practice and Lore of Neural Net Training</h2>\n<p>Particularly over the past decade, there&#8217;ve been many advances in the art of training neural nets. And, yes, it is basically an art. Sometimes—especially in retrospect—one can see at least a glimmer of a &#8220;scientific explanation&#8221; for something that&#8217;s being done. But mostly things have been discovered by trial and error, adding ideas and tricks that have progressively built a significant lore about how to work with neural nets.</p>\n<p>There are several key parts. First, there&#8217;s the matter of what architecture of neural net one should use for a particular task. Then there&#8217;s the critical issue of how one&#8217;s going to get the data on which to train the neural net. And increasingly one isn&#8217;t dealing with training a net from scratch: instead a new net can either directly incorporate another already-trained net, or at least can use that net to generate more training examples for itself.</p>\n<p>One might have thought that for every particular kind of task one would need a different architecture of neural net. But what&#8217;s been found is that the same architecture often seems to work even for apparently quite different tasks. At some level this reminds one of the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-11--the-notion-of-computation#sect-11-3--the-phenomenon-of-universality\">idea of universal computation</a> (and my <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/\">Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>), but, as I&#8217;ll discuss later, I think it&#8217;s more a reflection of the fact that the tasks we&#8217;re typically trying to get neural nets to do are &#8220;human-like&#8221; ones—and neural nets can capture quite general &#8220;human-like processes&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In earlier days of neural nets, there tended to be the idea that one should &#8220;make the neural net do as little as possible&#8221;. For example, in <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SpeechRecognize.html\">converting speech to text</a> it was thought that one should first analyze the audio of the speech, break it into phonemes, etc. But what was found is that—at least for &#8220;human-like tasks&#8221;—it&#8217;s usually better just to try to train the neural net on the &#8220;end-to-end problem&#8221;, letting it &#8220;discover&#8221; the necessary intermediate features, encodings, etc. for itself.</p>\n<p>There was also the idea that one should introduce complicated individual components into the neural net, to let it in effect &#8220;explicitly implement particular algorithmic ideas&#8221;. But once again, this has mostly turned out not to be worthwhile; instead, it&#8217;s better just to deal with very simple components and let them &#8220;organize themselves&#8221; (albeit usually in ways we can&#8217;t understand) to achieve (presumably) the equivalent of those algorithmic ideas. </p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that there are no &#8220;structuring ideas&#8221; that are relevant for neural nets. Thus, for example, having <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ConvolutionLayer.html\">2D arrays of neurons with local connections</a> seems at least very useful in the early stages of processing images. And having patterns of connectivity that concentrate on &#8220;looking back in sequences&#8221; seems useful—as we&#8217;ll see later—in dealing with things like human language, for example in ChatGPT. </p>\n<p>But an important feature of neural nets is that—like computers in general—they&#8217;re ultimately just dealing with data. And current neural nets—with current approaches to neural net training—<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/NetEncoderDecoder.html\">specifically deal with arrays of numbers</a>. But in the course of processing, those arrays can be completely rearranged and reshaped. And as an example, <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/LeNet-Trained-on-MNIST-Data/\">the network we used for identifying digits above</a> starts with a 2D &#8220;image-like&#8221; array, quickly &#8220;thickening&#8221; to many channels, but then <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AggregationLayer.html\">&#8220;concentrating down&#8221; into a 1D array</a> that will ultimately contain elements representing the different possible output digits:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img74_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img74.png' alt='' title='' width='287' height='182'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>But, OK, how can one tell how big a neural net one will need for a particular task? It&#8217;s something of an art. At some level the key thing is to know &#8220;how hard the task is&#8221;. But for human-like tasks that&#8217;s typically very hard to estimate. Yes, there may be a systematic way to do the task very &#8220;mechanically&#8221; by computer. But it&#8217;s hard to know if there are what one might think of as tricks or shortcuts that allow one to do the task at least at a &#8220;human-like level&#8221; vastly more easily. It might take <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/games-and-puzzles-as-multicomputational-systems/\">enumerating a giant game tree</a> to &#8220;mechanically&#8221; play a certain game; but there might be a much easier (&#8220;heuristic&#8221;) way to achieve &#8220;human-level play&#8221;.</p>\n<p>When one&#8217;s dealing with tiny neural nets and simple tasks one can sometimes explicitly see that one &#8220;can&#8217;t get there from here&#8221;. For example, here&#8217;s the best one seems to be able to do on the task from the previous section with a few small neural nets: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img75_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img75.png' alt='' title='' width='498' height='395'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And what we see is that if the net is too small, it just can&#8217;t reproduce the function we want. But above some size, it has no problem—at least if one trains it for long enough, with enough examples. And, by the way, these pictures illustrate a piece of neural net lore: that one can often get away with a smaller network if there&#8217;s a &#8220;squeeze&#8221; in the middle that forces everything to go through a smaller intermediate number of neurons. (It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that &#8220;no-intermediate-layer&#8221;—or so-called &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">perceptron</a>&#8221;—networks can only learn essentially linear functions—but as soon as there&#8217;s even one intermediate layer it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">always in principle possible</a> to approximate any function arbitrarily well, at least if one has enough neurons, though to make it feasibly trainable one typically has some kind of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/BatchNormalizationLayer.html\">regularization or normalization</a>.)</p>\n<p>OK, so let&#8217;s say one&#8217;s settled on a certain neural net architecture. Now there&#8217;s the issue of getting data to train the network with. And many of the practical challenges around neural nets—and machine learning in general—center on acquiring or preparing the necessary training data. In many cases (&#8220;supervised learning&#8221;) one wants to get explicit examples of inputs and the outputs one is expecting from them. Thus, for example, one might want images tagged by what&#8217;s in them, or some other attribute. And maybe one will have to explicitly go through—usually with great effort—and do the tagging. But very often it turns out to be possible to piggyback on something that&#8217;s already been done, or use it as some kind of proxy. And so, for example, one might use alt tags that have been provided for images on the web. Or, in a different domain, one might use closed captions that have been created for videos. Or—for language translation training—one might use parallel versions of webpages or other documents that exist in different languages.</p>\n<p>How much data do you need to show a neural net to train it for a particular task? Again, it&#8217;s hard to estimate from first principles. Certainly the requirements can be dramatically reduced by using &#8220;transfer learning&#8221; to &#8220;transfer in&#8221; things like lists of important features that have already been learned in another network. But generally neural nets need to &#8220;see a lot of examples&#8221; to train well. And at least for some tasks it&#8217;s an important piece of neural net lore that the examples can be incredibly repetitive. And indeed it&#8217;s a standard strategy to just show a neural net all the examples one has, over and over again. In each of these &#8220;training rounds&#8221; (or &#8220;epochs&#8221;) the neural net will be in at least a slightly different state, and somehow &#8220;reminding it&#8221; of a particular example is useful in getting it to &#8220;remember that example&#8221;. (And, yes, perhaps this is analogous to the usefulness of repetition in human memorization.)</p>\n<p>But often just repeating the same example over and over again isn&#8217;t enough. It&#8217;s also necessary to show the neural net variations of the example. And it&#8217;s a feature of neural net lore that those &#8220;data augmentation&#8221; variations don&#8217;t have to be sophisticated to be useful. Just slightly modifying images with basic image processing can make them essentially &#8220;as good as new&#8221; for neural net training. And, similarly, when one&#8217;s run out of actual video, etc. for training self-driving cars, one can go on and just get data from running simulations in a model videogame-like environment without all the detail of actual real-world scenes.</p>\n<p>How about something like ChatGPT? Well, it has the nice feature that it can do &#8220;unsupervised learning&#8221;, making it much easier to get it examples to train from. Recall that the basic task for ChatGPT is to figure out how to continue a piece of text that it&#8217;s been given. So to get it &#8220;training examples&#8221; all one has to do is get a piece of text, and mask out the end of it, and then use this as the &#8220;input to train from&#8221;—with the &#8220;output&#8221; being the complete, unmasked piece of text. We&#8217;ll discuss this more later, but the main point is that—unlike, say, for learning what&#8217;s in images—there&#8217;s no &#8220;explicit tagging&#8221; needed; ChatGPT can in effect just learn directly from whatever examples of text it&#8217;s given.</p>\n<p>OK, so what about the actual learning process in a neural net? In the end it&#8217;s all about determining what weights will best capture the training examples that have been given. And there are all sorts of detailed choices and &#8220;hyperparameter settings&#8221; (so called because the weights can be thought of as &#8220;parameters&#8221;) that can be used to tweak how this is done. There are different <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CrossEntropyLossLayer.html\">choices of loss function</a> (sum of squares, sum of absolute values, etc.). There are different ways to do loss minimization (how far in weight space to move at each step, etc.). And then there are questions like how big a &#8220;batch&#8221; of examples to show to get each successive estimate of the loss one&#8217;s trying to minimize. And, yes, one can apply machine learning (as we do, for example, in Wolfram Language) to automate machine learning—and to automatically set things like hyperparameters.</p>\n<p>But in the end the whole process of training can be characterized by seeing how the loss progressively decreases (as in this <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NetTrain.html\">Wolfram Language progress monitor for a small training</a>):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img76_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img76.png' alt='' title='' width='261' height='327'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And what one typically sees is that the loss decreases for a while, but eventually flattens out at some constant value. If that value is sufficiently small, then the training can be considered successful; otherwise it&#8217;s probably a sign one should try changing the network architecture. </p>\n<p>Can one tell how long it should take for the &#8220;learning curve&#8221; to flatten out? Like for so many other things, there seem to be approximate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">power-law scaling relationships</a> that depend on the size of neural net and amount of data one&#8217;s using. But the general conclusion is that training a neural net is hard—and takes a lot of computational effort. And as a practical matter, the vast majority of that effort is spent doing operations on arrays of numbers, which is what GPUs are good at—which is why neural net training is typically limited by the availability of GPUs. </p>\n<p>In the future, will there be fundamentally better ways to train neural nets—or generally do what neural nets do? Almost certainly, I think. The fundamental idea of neural nets is to create a flexible &#8220;computing fabric&#8221; out of a large number of simple (essentially identical) components—and to have this &#8220;fabric&#8221; be one that can be incrementally modified to learn from examples. In current neural nets, one&#8217;s essentially using the ideas of calculus—applied to real numbers—to do that incremental modification. But it&#8217;s increasingly clear that having high-precision numbers doesn&#8217;t matter; 8 bits or less might be enough even with current methods. </p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave\">computational systems like cellular automata</a> that basically operate in parallel on many individual bits it&#8217;s never been clear <a href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/approaches-complexity-engineering.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to do this kind of incremental modification</a>, but there&#8217;s no reason to think it isn&#8217;t possible. And in fact, much like with the &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deep-learning breakthrough of 2012</a>&#8221; it may be that such incremental modification will effectively be easier in more complicated cases than in simple ones.</p>\n<p>Neural nets—perhaps a bit like brains—are set up to have an essentially fixed network of neurons, with what&#8217;s modified being the strength (&#8220;weight&#8221;) of connections between them. (Perhaps in at least young brains significant numbers of wholly new connections can also grow.) But while this might be a convenient setup for biology, it&#8217;s not at all clear that it&#8217;s even close to the best way to achieve the functionality we need. And something that involves the equivalent of progressive network rewriting (perhaps reminiscent of our <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Physics Project</a>) might well ultimately be better.</p>\n<p>But even within the framework of existing neural nets there&#8217;s currently a crucial limitation: neural net training as it&#8217;s now done is fundamentally sequential, with the effects of each batch of examples being propagated back to update the weights. And indeed with current computer hardware—even taking into account GPUs—most of a neural net is &#8220;idle&#8221; most of the time during training, with just one part at a time being updated. And in a sense this is because our current computers tend to have memory that is separate from their CPUs (or GPUs). But in brains it&#8217;s presumably different—with every &#8220;memory element&#8221; (i.e. neuron) also being a potentially active computational element. And if we could set up our future computer hardware this way it might become possible to do training much more efficiently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surely-a-network-thats-big-enough-can-do-anything\">&#8220;Surely a Network That&#8217;s Big Enough Can Do Anything!&#8221; </h2>\n<p>The capabilities of something like ChatGPT seem so impressive that one might imagine that if one could just &#8220;keep going&#8221; and train larger and larger neural networks, then they&#8217;d eventually be able to &#8220;do everything&#8221;. And if one&#8217;s concerned with things that are readily accessible to immediate human thinking, it&#8217;s quite possible that this is the case. But the lesson of the past several hundred years of science is that there are things that can be figured out by formal processes, but aren&#8217;t readily accessible to immediate human thinking.</p>\n<p>Nontrivial mathematics is one big example. But the general case is really computation. And ultimately the issue is the phenomenon of <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility\">computational irreducibility</a>. There are some computations which one might think would take many steps to do, but which can in fact be &#8220;reduced&#8221; to something quite immediate. But the discovery of computational irreducibility implies that this doesn&#8217;t always work. And instead there are processes—probably like the one below—where to work out what happens inevitably requires essentially tracing each computational step:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img77_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img77.png' alt='' title='' width='553' height='279'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The kinds of things that we normally do with our brains are presumably specifically chosen to avoid computational irreducibility. It takes special effort to do math in one&#8217;s brain. And it&#8217;s in practice largely impossible to &#8220;think through&#8221; the steps in the operation of any nontrivial program just in one&#8217;s brain. </p>\n<p>But of course for that we have computers. And with computers we can readily do long, computationally irreducible things. And the key point is that there&#8217;s in general no shortcut for these. </p>\n<p>Yes, we could memorize lots of specific examples of what happens in some particular computational system. And maybe we could even see some (&#8220;computationally reducible&#8221;) patterns that would allow us to do a little generalization. But the point is that computational irreducibility means that we can never guarantee that the unexpected won&#8217;t happen—and it&#8217;s only by explicitly doing the computation that you can tell what actually happens in any particular case.</p>\n<p>And in the end there&#8217;s just a fundamental tension between learnability and computational irreducibility. Learning involves in effect <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/\">compressing data by leveraging regularities</a>. But computational irreducibility implies that ultimately there&#8217;s a limit to what regularities there may be.</p>\n<p>As a practical matter, one can imagine building little computational devices—like cellular automata or Turing machines—into trainable systems like neural nets. And indeed such devices can serve as good &#8220;tools&#8221; for the neural net—like <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\">Wolfram|Alpha can be a good tool for ChatGPT</a>. But computational irreducibility implies that one can&#8217;t expect to &#8220;get inside&#8221; those devices and have them learn.</p>\n<p>Or put another way, there&#8217;s an ultimate tradeoff between capability and trainability: the more you want a system to make &#8220;true use&#8221; of its computational capabilities, the more it&#8217;s going to show computational irreducibility, and the less it&#8217;s going to be trainable. And the more it&#8217;s fundamentally trainable, the less it&#8217;s going to be able to do sophisticated computation.</p>\n<p>(For ChatGPT as it currently is, the situation is actually much more extreme, because the neural net used to generate each token of output is a pure &#8220;feed-forward&#8221; network, without loops, and therefore has no ability to do any kind of computation with nontrivial &#8220;control flow&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>Of course, one might wonder whether it&#8217;s actually important to be able to do irreducible computations. And indeed for much of human history it wasn&#8217;t particularly important. But our modern technological world has been built on engineering that makes use of at least mathematical computations—and increasingly also more general computations. And if we look at the natural world, it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/\">full of irreducible computation</a>—that we&#8217;re slowly understanding how to emulate and use for our technological purposes. </p>\n<p>Yes, a neural net can certainly notice the kinds of regularities in the natural world that we might also readily notice with &#8220;unaided human thinking&#8221;. But if we want to work out things that are in the purview of mathematical or computational science the neural net isn&#8217;t going to be able to do it—unless it effectively &#8220;uses as a tool&#8221; an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; computational system.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s something potentially confusing about all of this. In the past there were plenty of tasks—including writing essays—that we&#8217;ve assumed were somehow &#8220;fundamentally too hard&#8221; for computers. And now that we see them done by the likes of ChatGPT we tend to suddenly think that computers must have become vastly more powerful—in particular surpassing things they were already basically able to do (like progressively computing the behavior of computational systems like cellular automata). </p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t the right conclusion to draw. Computationally irreducible processes are still computationally irreducible, and are still fundamentally hard for computers—even if computers can readily compute their individual steps. And instead what we should conclude is that tasks—like writing essays—that we humans could do, but we didn&#8217;t think computers could do, are actually in some sense computationally easier than we thought. </p>\n<p>In other words, the reason a neural net can be successful in writing an essay is because writing an essay turns out to be a &#8220;computationally shallower&#8221; problem than we thought. And in a sense this takes us closer to &#8220;having a theory&#8221; of how we humans manage to do things like writing essays, or in general deal with language. </p>\n<p>If you had a big enough neural net then, yes, you might be able to do whatever humans can readily do. But you wouldn&#8217;t capture what the natural world in general can do—or that the tools that we&#8217;ve fashioned from the natural world can do. And it&#8217;s the use of those tools—both practical and conceptual—that have allowed us in recent centuries to transcend the boundaries of what&#8217;s accessible to &#8220;pure unaided human thought&#8221;, and capture for human purposes more of what&#8217;s out there in the physical and computational universe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-concept-of-embeddings\">The Concept of Embeddings</h2>\n<p>Neural nets—at least as they&#8217;re currently set up—are fundamentally based on numbers. So if we&#8217;re going to to use them to work on something like text we&#8217;ll need a way to <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/NetEncoderDecoder.html\">represent our text with numbers</a>. And certainly we could start (essentially as ChatGPT does) by just assigning a number to every word in the dictionary. But there&#8217;s an important idea—that&#8217;s for example central to ChatGPT—that goes beyond that. And it&#8217;s the idea of &#8220;embeddings&#8221;. One can think of an embedding as a way to try to represent the &#8220;essence&#8221; of something by an array of numbers—with the property that &#8220;nearby things&#8221; are represented by nearby numbers.</p>\n<p>And so, for example, we can think of a word embedding as trying to <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FeatureSpacePlot.html\">lay out words in a kind of &#8220;meaning space&#8221;</a> in which words that are somehow &#8220;nearby in meaning&#8221; appear nearby in the embedding. The actual embeddings that are used—say in ChatGPT—tend to involve large lists of numbers. But if we project down to 2D, we can show examples of how words are laid out by the embedding: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img78_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img78.png' alt='' title='' width='432' height='430'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, what we see does remarkably well in capturing typical everyday impressions. But how can we construct such an embedding? Roughly the idea is to look at large amounts of text (here 5 billion words from the web) and then see &#8220;how similar&#8221; the &#8220;environments&#8221; are in which different words appear. So, for example, &#8220;alligator&#8221; and &#8220;crocodile&#8221; will often appear almost interchangeably in otherwise similar sentences, and that means they&#8217;ll be placed nearby in the embedding. But &#8220;turnip&#8221; and &#8220;eagle&#8221; won&#8217;t tend to appear in otherwise similar sentences, so they&#8217;ll be placed far apart in the embedding.</p>\n<p>But how does one actually implement something like this using neural nets? Let&#8217;s start by talking about embeddings not for words, but for images. We want to find some way to characterize images by lists of numbers in such a way that &#8220;images we consider similar&#8221; are assigned similar lists of numbers. </p>\n<p>How do we tell if we should &#8220;consider images similar&#8221;? Well, if our images are, say, of handwritten digits we might &#8220;consider two images similar&#8221; if they are of the same digit. Earlier we discussed a neural net that was trained to recognize handwritten digits. And we can think of this neural net as being set up so that in its final output it puts images into 10 different bins, one for each digit.</p>\n<p>But what if we &#8220;intercept&#8221; what&#8217;s going on inside the neural net before the final &#8220;it&#8217;s a &#8216;4&#8217;&#8221; decision is made? We might expect that inside the neural net there are numbers that characterize images as being &#8220;mostly 4-like but a bit 2-like&#8221; or some such. And the idea is to pick up such numbers to use as elements in an embedding.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s the concept. Rather than directly trying to characterize &#8220;what image is near what other image&#8221;, we instead consider a well-defined task (in this case digit recognition) for which we can get explicit training data—then use the fact that in doing this task the neural net implicitly has to make what amount to &#8220;nearness decisions&#8221;. So instead of us ever explicitly having to talk about &#8220;nearness of images&#8221; we&#8217;re just talking about the concrete question of what digit an image represents, and then we&#8217;re &#8220;leaving it to the neural net&#8221; to implicitly determine what that implies about &#8220;nearness of images&#8221;.</p>\n<p>So how in more detail does this work for the digit recognition network? We can think of the network as consisting of 11 successive layers, that we might summarize iconically like this (with activation functions shown as separate layers):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img79_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img79.png' alt='' title='' width='600' height='35'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>At the beginning we&#8217;re feeding into the first layer actual images, represented by 2D arrays of pixel values. And at the end—from the last layer—we&#8217;re getting out an array of 10 values, which we can think of saying &#8220;how certain&#8221; the network is that the image corresponds to each of the digits 0 through 9. </p>\n<p>Feed in the image <img style=\"margin-bottom: -5px\" src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423number4.png' alt='' title='' width='24' height='14'/>and the values of the neurons in that last layer are:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img81_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img81.png' alt='' title='' width='519' height='52'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>In other words, the neural net is by this point &#8220;incredibly certain&#8221; that this image is a 4—and to actually get the output &#8220;4&#8221; we just have to pick out the position of the neuron with the largest value.</p>\n<p>But what if we look one step earlier? The very last operation in the network is a so-called <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SoftmaxLayer.html\">softmax</a> which tries to &#8220;force certainty&#8221;. But before that&#8217;s been applied the values of the neurons are:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img82_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img82.png' alt='' title='' width='395' height='37'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The neuron representing &#8220;4&#8221; still has the highest numerical value. But there&#8217;s also information in the values of the other neurons. And we can expect that this list of numbers can in a sense be used to characterize the &#8220;essence&#8221; of the image—and thus to provide something we can use as an embedding. And so, for example, each of the 4&#8217;s here has a slightly different &#8220;signature&#8221; (or &#8220;feature embedding&#8221;)—all very different from the 8&#8217;s:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img83_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img83.png' alt='' title='' width='529' height='72'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here we&#8217;re essentially using 10 numbers to characterize our images. But it&#8217;s often better to use much more than that. And for example in our digit recognition network we can get an array of 500 numbers by tapping into the preceding layer. And this is probably a reasonable array to use as an &#8220;image embedding&#8221;. </p>\n<p>If we want to make an explicit visualization of &#8220;image space&#8221; for handwritten digits we need to &#8220;reduce the dimension&#8221;, effectively by projecting the 500-dimensional vector we&#8217;ve got into, say, 3D space:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img84_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img84.png' alt='' title='' width='326' height='354'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve just talked about creating a characterization (and thus embedding) for images based effectively on identifying the similarity of images by determining whether (according to our training set) they correspond to the same handwritten digit. And we can do the same thing much more generally for images if we have a training set that identifies, say, which of 5000 common types of object (cat, dog, chair, &#8230;) each image is of. And in this way we can make an image embedding that&#8217;s &#8220;anchored&#8221; by our identification of common objects, but then &#8220;generalizes around that&#8221; according to the behavior of the neural net. And the point is that insofar as that behavior aligns with how we humans perceive and interpret images, this will end up being an embedding that &#8220;seems right to us&#8221;, and is useful in practice in doing &#8220;human-judgement-like&#8221; tasks.</p>\n<p>OK, so how do we follow the same kind of approach to find embeddings for words? The key is to start from a task about words for which we can readily do training. And the standard such task is &#8220;word prediction&#8221;. Imagine we&#8217;re given &#8220;the ___ cat&#8221;. Based on a large corpus of text (say, the text content of the web), what are the probabilities for different words that might &#8220;fill in the blank&#8221;? Or, alternatively, given &#8220;___ black ___&#8221; what are the probabilities for different &#8220;flanking words&#8221;?</p>\n<p>How do we set this problem up for a neural net? Ultimately we have to formulate everything in terms of numbers. And one way to do this is just to assign a unique number to each of the 50,000 or so common words in English. So, for example, &#8220;the&#8221; might be 914, and &#8220; cat&#8221; (with a space before it) might be 3542. (And these are the actual numbers used by GPT-2.) So for the &#8220;the ___ cat&#8221; problem, our input might be {914, 3542}. What should the output be like? Well, it should be a list of 50,000 or so numbers that effectively give the probabilities for each of the possible &#8220;fill-in&#8221; words. And once again, to find an embedding, we want to &#8220;intercept&#8221; the &#8220;insides&#8221; of the neural net just before it &#8220;reaches its conclusion&#8221;—and then pick up the list of numbers that occur there, and that we can think of as &#8220;characterizing each word&#8221;.</p>\n<p>OK, so what do those characterizations look like? Over the past 10 years there&#8217;ve been a sequence of different systems developed (<a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/ConceptNet-Numberbatch-Word-Vectors-V17.06/\">word2vec</a>, <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/search/?i=GloVe\">GloVe</a>, <a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/search/?i=BERT\">BERT</a>, <a href=\" https://resources.wolframcloud.com/NeuralNetRepository/resources/GPT2-Transformer-Trained-on-WebText-Data/\">GPT</a>, &#8230;), each based on a different neural net approach. But ultimately all of them take words and characterize them by lists of hundreds to thousands of numbers. </p>\n<p>In their raw form, these &#8220;embedding vectors&#8221; are quite uninformative. For example, here&#8217;s what GPT-2 produces as the raw embedding vectors for three specific words: </p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img85_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img85.png' alt='' title='' width='467' height='131'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>If we do things like measure distances between these vectors, then we can find things like &#8220;nearnesses&#8221; of words. Later we&#8217;ll discuss in more detail what we might consider the &#8220;cognitive&#8221; significance of such embeddings. But for now the main point is that we have a way to usefully turn words into &#8220;neural-net-friendly&#8221; collections of numbers.</p>\n<p>But actually we can go further than just characterizing words by collections of numbers; we can also do this for sequences of words, or indeed whole blocks of text. And inside ChatGPT that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s dealing with things. It takes the text it&#8217;s got so far, and generates an embedding vector to represent it. Then its goal is to find the probabilities for different words that might occur next. And it represents its answer for this as a list of numbers that essentially give the probabilities for each of the 50,000 or so possible words.</p>\n<p>(Strictly, ChatGPT does not deal with words, but <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rather with &#8220;tokens&#8221;</a>—convenient linguistic units that might be whole words, or might just be pieces like &#8220;pre&#8221; or &#8220;ing&#8221; or &#8220;ized&#8221;. Working with tokens makes it easier for ChatGPT to handle rare, compound and non-English words, and, sometimes, for better or worse, to invent new words.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"inside-chatgpt\">Inside ChatGPT</h2>\n<p>OK, so we&#8217;re finally ready to discuss what&#8217;s inside ChatGPT. And, yes, ultimately, it&#8217;s a giant neural net—currently a version of the so-called GPT-3 network with 175 billion weights. In many ways this is a neural net very much like the other ones we&#8217;ve discussed. But it&#8217;s a neural net that&#8217;s particularly set up for dealing with language. And its most notable feature is a piece of neural net architecture called a &#8220;transformer&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the first neural nets we discussed above, every neuron at any given layer was basically connected (at least with some weight) to every neuron on the layer before. But this kind of fully connected network is (presumably) overkill if one&#8217;s working with data that has particular, known structure. And thus, for example, in the early stages of dealing with images, it&#8217;s typical to use so-called <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ConvolutionLayer.html\">convolutional neural nets</a> (&#8220;convnets&#8221;) in which neurons are effectively laid out on a grid analogous to the pixels in the image—and connected only to neurons nearby on the grid. </p>\n<p>The idea of transformers is to do something at least somewhat similar for sequences of tokens that make up a piece of text. But instead of just defining a fixed region in the sequence over which there can be connections, transformers instead introduce the notion of &#8220;<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AttentionLayer.html\">attention</a>&#8221;—and the idea of &#8220;paying attention&#8221; more to some parts of the sequence than others. Maybe one day it&#8217;ll make sense to just start a generic neural net and do all customization through training. But at least as of now it seems to be critical in practice to &#8220;modularize&#8221; things—as transformers do, and probably as our brains also do. </p>\n<p>OK, so what does ChatGPT (or, rather, the GPT-3 network on which it&#8217;s based) actually do? Recall that its overall goal is to continue text in a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; way, based on what it&#8217;s seen from the training it&#8217;s had (which consists in looking at billions of pages of text from the web, etc.) So at any given point, it&#8217;s got a certain amount of text—and its goal is to come up with an appropriate choice for the next token to add.</p>\n<p>It operates in three basic stages. First, it takes the sequence of tokens that corresponds to the text so far, and finds an embedding (i.e. an array of numbers) that represents these. Then it operates on this embedding—in a &#8220;standard neural net way&#8221;, with values &#8220;rippling through&#8221; successive layers in a network—to produce a new embedding (i.e. a new array of numbers). It then takes the last part of this array and generates from it an array of about 50,000 values that turn into probabilities for different possible next tokens. (And, yes, it so happens that there are about the same number of tokens used as there are common words in English, though only about 3000 of the tokens are whole words, and the rest are fragments.)</p>\n<p>A critical point is that every part of this pipeline is implemented by a neural network, whose weights are determined by end-to-end training of the network. In other words, in effect nothing except the overall architecture is &#8220;explicitly engineered&#8221;; everything is just &#8220;learned&#8221; from training data.</p>\n<p>There are, however, plenty of details in the way the architecture is set up—reflecting all sorts of experience and neural net lore. And—even though this is definitely going into the weeds—I think it&#8217;s useful to talk about some of those details, not least to get a sense of just what goes into building something like ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>First comes the embedding module. Here&#8217;s a schematic Wolfram Language representation for it for GPT-2:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img86_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img86.png' alt='' title='' width='424' height='217'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The input is a <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/netencoder/SubwordTokens.html\">vector of <em>n</em> tokens</a> (represented as in the previous section by integers from 1 to about 50,000). Each of these tokens is converted (by a <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EmbeddingLayer.html\">single-layer neural net</a>) into an embedding vector (of length 768 for GPT-2 and 12,288 for ChatGPT&#8217;s GPT-3). Meanwhile, there&#8217;s a &#8220;secondary pathway&#8221; that takes the <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SequenceIndicesLayer.html\">sequence of (integer) positions</a> for the tokens, and from these integers creates another embedding vector. And finally the embedding vectors from the token value and the token position are <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ThreadingLayer.html\">added together</a>—to produce the final sequence of embedding vectors from the embedding module.</p>\n<p>Why does one just add the token-value and token-position embedding vectors together? I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any particular science to this. It&#8217;s just that various different things have been tried, and this is one that seems to work. And it&#8217;s part of the lore of neural nets that—in some sense—so long as the setup one has is &#8220;roughly right&#8221; it&#8217;s usually possible to home in on details just by doing sufficient training, without ever really needing to &#8220;understand at an engineering level&#8221; quite how the neural net has ended up configuring itself.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the embedding module does, operating on the string <em>hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye</em>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img87_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img87.png' alt='' title='' width='373' height='158'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>The elements of the embedding vector for each token are shown down the page, and across the page we see first a run of &#8220;<em>hello</em>&#8221; embeddings, followed by a run of &#8220;<em>bye</em>&#8221; ones. The second array above is the positional embedding—with its somewhat-random-looking structure being just what &#8220;happened to be learned&#8221; (in this case in GPT-2).</p>\n<p>OK, so after the embedding module comes the &#8220;main event&#8221; of the transformer: a sequence of so-called &#8220;attention blocks&#8221; (12 for GPT-2, 96 for ChatGPT&#8217;s GPT-3). It&#8217;s all pretty complicated—and reminiscent of typical large hard-to-understand engineering systems, or, for that matter, biological systems. But anyway, here&#8217;s a schematic representation of a single &#8220;attention block&#8221; (for GPT-2):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img88_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img88.png' alt='' title='' width='654' height='193'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Within each such attention block there are a collection of &#8220;attention heads&#8221; (12 for GPT-2, 96 for ChatGPT&#8217;s GPT-3)—each of which operates independently on different chunks of values in the embedding vector. (And, yes, we don&#8217;t know any particular reason why it&#8217;s a good idea to split up the embedding vector, or what the different parts of it &#8220;mean&#8221;; this is just one of those things that&#8217;s been &#8220;found to work&#8221;.) </p>\n<p>OK, so what do the attention heads do? Basically they&#8217;re a way of &#8220;looking back&#8221; in the sequence of tokens (i.e. in the text produced so far), and &#8220;packaging up the past&#8221; in a form that&#8217;s useful for finding the next token. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/#its-just-adding-one-word-at-a-time\">In the first section above</a> we talked about using 2-gram probabilities to pick words based on their immediate predecessors. What the &#8220;attention&#8221; mechanism in transformers does is to allow &#8220;attention to&#8221; even much earlier words—thus potentially capturing the way, say, verbs can refer to nouns that appear many words before them in a sentence.</p>\n<p>At a more detailed level, what an attention head does is to recombine chunks in the embedding vectors associated with different tokens, with certain weights. And so, for example, the 12 attention heads in the first attention block (in GPT-2) have the following (&#8220;look-back-all-the-way-to-the-beginning-of-the-sequence-of-tokens&#8221;) patterns of &#8220;recombination weights&#8221; for the &#8220;<em>hello</em>, <em>bye</em>&#8221; string above:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img89_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img89A.png' alt='' title='' width='550' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>After being processed by the attention heads, the resulting &#8220;re-weighted embedding vector&#8221; (of length 768 for GPT-2 and length 12,288 for ChatGPT&#8217;s GPT-3) is passed through a standard <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LinearLayer.html\">&#8220;fully connected&#8221; neural net layer</a>.

Ultimately it&#8217;s presumably some &#8220;neural net encoding&#8221; of features of human language. But as of now, what those features might be is quite unknown. In effect, we&#8217;re &#8220;opening up the brain of ChatGPT&#8221; (or at least GPT-2) and discovering, yes, it&#8217;s complicated in there, and we don&#8217;t understand it—even though in the end it&#8217;s producing recognizable human language.</p>\n<p>OK, so after going through one attention block, we&#8217;ve got a new embedding vector—which is then successively passed through additional attention blocks (a total of 12 for GPT-2; 96 for GPT-3). Each attention block has its own particular pattern of &#8220;attention&#8221; and &#8220;fully connected&#8221; weights. Here for GPT-2 are the sequence of attention weights for the &#8220;hello, bye&#8221; input, for the first attention head:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img92_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img92A.png' alt='' title='' width='512' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And here are the (moving-averaged) &#8220;matrices&#8221; for the fully connected layers:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img93_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img93A.png' alt='' title='' width='569' height='422'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Curiously, even though these &#8220;matrices of weights&#8221; in different attention blocks look quite similar, the distributions of the sizes of weights can be somewhat different (and are not always Gaussian):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img94_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img94A.png' alt='' title='' width='351' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>So after going through all these attention blocks what is the net effect of the transformer? Essentially it&#8217;s to transform the original collection of embeddings for the sequence of tokens to a final collection. And the particular way ChatGPT works is then to pick up the last embedding in this collection, and &#8220;decode&#8221; it to produce a list of probabilities for what token should come next.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s in outline what&#8217;s inside ChatGPT. It may seem complicated (not least because of its many inevitably somewhat arbitrary &#8220;engineering choices&#8221;), but actually the ultimate elements involved are remarkably simple. Because in the end what we&#8217;re dealing with is just a neural net made of &#8220;artificial neurons&#8221;, each doing the simple operation of taking a collection of numerical inputs, and then combining them with certain weights. </p>\n<p>The original input to ChatGPT is an array of numbers (the embedding vectors for the tokens so far), and what happens when ChatGPT &#8220;runs&#8221; to produce a new token is just that these numbers &#8220;ripple through&#8221; the layers of the neural net, with each neuron &#8220;doing its thing&#8221; and passing the result to neurons on the next layer. There&#8217;s no looping or &#8220;going back&#8221;. Everything just &#8220;feeds forward&#8221; through the network. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a very different setup from a typical computational system—like a <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-\\ programs/#sect-3-4--turing-machines\">Turing machine</a>—in which results are repeatedly &#8220;reprocessed&#8221; by the same computational elements. Here—at least in generating a given token of output—each computational element (i.e. neuron) is used only once. </p>\n<p>But there is in a sense still an &#8220;outer loop&#8221; that reuses computational elements even in ChatGPT. Because when ChatGPT is going to generate a new token, it always &#8220;reads&#8221; (i.e. takes as input) the whole sequence of tokens that come before it, including tokens that ChatGPT itself has &#8220;written&#8221; previously. And we can think of this setup as meaning that ChatGPT does—at least at its outermost level—involve a &#8220;feedback loop&#8221;, albeit one in which every iteration is explicitly visible as a token that appears in the text that it generates.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s come back to the core of ChatGPT: the neural net that&#8217;s being repeatedly used to generate each token. At some level it&#8217;s very simple: a whole collection of identical artificial neurons. And some parts of the network just consist of (&#8220;<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LinearLayer.html\">fully connected</a>&#8221;) layers of neurons in which every neuron on a given layer is connected (with some weight) to every neuron on the layer before. But particularly with its transformer architecture, ChatGPT has parts with more structure, in which only specific neurons on different layers are connected. (Of course, one could still say that &#8220;all neurons are connected&#8221;—but some just have zero weight.)</p>\n<p>In addition, there are aspects of the neural net in ChatGPT that aren&#8217;t most naturally thought of as just consisting of &#8220;homogeneous&#8221; layers. And for example—as the iconic summary above indicates—inside an attention block there are places where &#8220;multiple copies are made&#8221; of incoming data, each then going through a different &#8220;processing path&#8221;, potentially involving a different number of layers, and only later recombining. But while this may be a convenient representation of what&#8217;s going on, it&#8217;s always at least in principle possible to think of &#8220;densely filling in&#8221; layers, but just having some weights be zero.</p>\n<p>If one looks at the longest path through ChatGPT, there are about 400 (core) layers involved—in some ways not a huge number. But there are millions of neurons—with a total of 175 billion connections and therefore 175 billion weights. And one thing to realize is that every time ChatGPT generates a new token, it has to do a calculation involving every single one of these weights. Implementationally these calculations can be somewhat organized &#8220;by layer&#8221; into highly parallel array operations that can conveniently be done on GPUs. But for each token that&#8217;s produced, there still have to be 175 billion calculations done (and in the end a bit more)—so that, yes, it&#8217;s not surprising that it can take a while to generate a long piece of text with ChatGPT. </p>\n<p>But in the end, the remarkable thing is that all these operations—individually as simple as they are—can somehow together manage to do such a good &#8220;human-like&#8221; job of generating text. It has to be emphasized again that (at least so far as we know) there&#8217;s no &#8220;ultimate theoretical reason&#8221; why anything like this should work. And in fact, as we&#8217;ll discuss, I think we have to view this as a—potentially surprising—scientific discovery: that somehow in a neural net like ChatGPT&#8217;s it&#8217;s possible to capture the essence of what human brains manage to do in generating language. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-training-of-chatgpt\">The Training of ChatGPT</h2>\n<p>OK, so we&#8217;ve now given an outline of how ChatGPT works once it&#8217;s set up. But how did it get set up? How were all those 175 billion weights in its neural net determined? Basically they&#8217;re the result of very large-scale training, based on a huge corpus of text—on the web, in books, etc.—written by humans. As we&#8217;ve said, even given all that training data, it&#8217;s certainly not obvious that a neural net would be able to successfully produce &#8220;human-like&#8221; text. And, once again, there seem to be detailed pieces of engineering needed to make that happen. But the big surprise—and discovery—of ChatGPT is that it&#8217;s possible at all. And that—in effect—a neural net with &#8220;just&#8221; 175 billion weights can make a &#8220;reasonable model&#8221; of text humans write.</p>\n<p>In modern times, there&#8217;s lots of text written by humans that&#8217;s out there in digital form. The public web has at least several billion human-written pages, with altogether perhaps a trillion words of text. And if one includes non-public webpages, the numbers might be at least 100 times larger. So far, more than 5 million digitized books have been made available (out of 100 million or so that have ever been published), giving another 100 billion or so words of text. And that&#8217;s not even mentioning text derived from speech in videos, etc. (As a personal comparison, <a href=\"https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/\">my total lifetime output of published material</a> has been a bit under 3 million words, and over the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/\">past 30 years I&#8217;ve written</a> about 15 million words of email, and altogether typed perhaps 50 million words—and in just the past couple of years I&#8217;ve spoken more than 10 million words on <a href=\"https://www.stephenwolfram.com/livestreams\">livestreams</a>. And, yes, I&#8217;ll train a bot from all of that.)</p>\n<p>But, OK, given all this data, how does one train a neural net from it? The basic process is very much as we discussed it in the simple examples above. You present a batch of examples, and then you adjust the weights in the network to minimize the error (&#8220;loss&#8221;) that the network makes on those examples. The main thing that&#8217;s expensive about &#8220;back propagating&#8221; from the error is that each time you do this, every weight in the network will typically change at least a tiny bit, and there are just a lot of weights to deal with. (The actual &#8220;back computation&#8221; is typically only a small constant factor harder than the forward one.)</p>\n<p>With modern GPU hardware, it&#8217;s straightforward to compute the results from batches of thousands of examples in parallel. But when it comes to actually updating the weights in the neural net, current methods require one to do this basically batch by batch. (And, yes, this is probably where actual brains—with their combined computation and memory elements—have, for now, at least an architectural advantage.)</p>\n<p>Even in the seemingly simple cases of learning numerical functions that we discussed earlier, we found we often had to use millions of examples to successfully train a network, at least from scratch. So how many examples does this mean we&#8217;ll need in order to train a &#8220;human-like language&#8221; model? There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any fundamental &#8220;theoretical&#8221; way to know. But in practice ChatGPT was successfully trained on a few hundred billion words of text.</p>\n<p>Some of the text it was fed several times, some of it only once. But somehow it &#8220;got what it needed&#8221; from the text it saw. But given this volume of text to learn from, how large a network should it require to &#8220;learn it well&#8221;? Again, we don&#8217;t yet have a fundamental theoretical way to say. Ultimately—as we&#8217;ll discuss further below—there&#8217;s presumably a certain &#8220;total algorithmic content&#8221; to human language and what humans typically say with it. But the next question is how efficient a neural net will be at implementing a model based on that algorithmic content. And again we don&#8217;t know—although the success of ChatGPT suggests it&#8217;s reasonably efficient.</p>\n<p>And in the end we can just note that ChatGPT does what it does using a couple hundred billion weights—comparable in number to the total number of words (or tokens) of training data it&#8217;s been given. In some ways it&#8217;s perhaps surprising (though empirically observed also in smaller analogs of ChatGPT) that the &#8220;size of the network&#8221; that seems to work well is so comparable to the &#8220;size of the training data&#8221;. After all, it&#8217;s certainly not that somehow &#8220;inside ChatGPT&#8221; all that text from the web and books and so on is &#8220;directly stored&#8221;. Because what&#8217;s actually inside ChatGPT are a bunch of numbers—with a bit less than 10 digits of precision—that are some kind of distributed encoding of the aggregate structure of all that text. </p>\n<p>Put another way, we might ask what the &#8220;effective information content&#8221; is of human language and what&#8217;s typically said with it. There&#8217;s the raw corpus of examples of language. And then there&#8217;s the representation in the neural net of ChatGPT. That representation is very likely far from the &#8220;algorithmically minimal&#8221; representation (as we&#8217;ll discuss below). But it&#8217;s a representation that&#8217;s readily usable by the neural net. And in this representation it seems there&#8217;s in the end rather little &#8220;compression&#8221; of the training data; it seems on average to basically take only a bit less than one neural net weight to carry the &#8220;information content&#8221; of a word of training data.</p>\n<p>When we run ChatGPT to generate text, we&#8217;re basically having to use each weight once. So if there are <em>n</em> weights, we&#8217;ve got of order <em>n</em> computational steps to do—though in practice many of them can typically be done in parallel in GPUs. But if we need about <em>n</em> words of training data to set up those weights, then from what we&#8217;ve said above we can conclude that we&#8217;ll need about <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> computational steps to do the training of the network—which is why, with current methods, one ends up needing to talk about billion-dollar training efforts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beyond-basic-training\">Beyond Basic Training</h2>\n<p>The majority of the effort in training ChatGPT is spent &#8220;showing it&#8221; large amounts of existing text from the web, books, etc. But it turns out there&#8217;s another—apparently rather important—part too. </p>\n<p>As soon as it&#8217;s finished its &#8220;raw training&#8221; from the original corpus of text it&#8217;s been shown, the neural net inside ChatGPT is ready to start generating its own text, continuing from prompts, etc. But while the results from this may often seem reasonable, they tend—particularly for longer pieces of text—to &#8220;wander off&#8221; in often rather non-human-like ways. It&#8217;s not something one can readily detect, say, by doing traditional statistics on the text. But it&#8217;s something that actual humans reading the text easily notice.</p>\n<p>And a <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key idea in the construction of ChatGPT</a> was to have another step after &#8220;passively reading&#8221; things like the web: to have actual humans actively interact with ChatGPT, see what it produces, and in effect give it feedback on &#8220;how to be a good chatbot&#8221;. But how can the neural net use that feedback? The first step is just to have humans rate results from the neural net. But then another neural net model is built that attempts to predict those ratings. But now this prediction model can be run—essentially like a loss function—on the original network, in effect allowing that network to be &#8220;tuned up&#8221; by the human feedback that&#8217;s been given. And the results in practice seem to have a big effect on the success of the system in producing &#8220;human-like&#8221; output. </p>\n<p>In general, it&#8217;s interesting how little &#8220;poking&#8221; the &#8220;originally trained&#8221; network seems to need to get it to usefully go in particular directions. One might have thought that to have the network behave as if it&#8217;s &#8220;learned something new&#8221; one would have to go in and run a training algorithm, adjusting weights, and so on.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the case. Instead, it seems to be sufficient to basically tell ChatGPT something one time—as part of the prompt you give—and then it can successfully make use of what you told it when it generates text. And once again, the fact that this works is, I think, an important clue in understanding what ChatGPT is &#8220;really doing&#8221; and how it relates to the structure of human language and thinking. </p>\n<p>There&#8217;s certainly something rather human-like about it: that at least once it&#8217;s had all that pre-training you can tell it something just once and it can &#8220;remember it&#8221;—at least &#8220;long enough&#8221; to generate a piece of text using it. So what&#8217;s going on in a case like this? It could be that &#8220;everything you might tell it is already in there somewhere&#8221;—and you&#8217;re just leading it to the right spot. But that doesn&#8217;t seem plausible. Instead, what seems more likely is that, yes, the elements are already in there, but the specifics are defined by something like a &#8220;trajectory between those elements&#8221; and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re introducing when you tell it something.</p>\n<p>And indeed, much like for humans, if you tell it something bizarre and unexpected that completely doesn&#8217;t fit into the framework it knows, it doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;ll successfully be able to &#8220;integrate&#8221; this. It can &#8220;integrate&#8221; it only if it&#8217;s basically riding in a fairly simple way on top of the framework it already has.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out again that there are inevitably &#8220;algorithmic limits&#8221; to what the neural net can &#8220;pick up&#8221;. Tell it &#8220;shallow&#8221; rules of the form &#8220;this goes to that&#8221;, etc., and the neural net will most likely be able to represent and reproduce these just fine—and indeed what it &#8220;already knows&#8221; from language will give it an immediate pattern to follow. But try to give it rules for an actual &#8220;deep&#8221; computation that involves many potentially computationally irreducible steps and it just won&#8217;t work. (Remember that at each step it&#8217;s always just &#8220;feeding data forward&#8221; in its network, never looping except by virtue of generating new tokens.)</p>\n<p>Of course, the network can learn the answer to specific &#8220;irreducible&#8221; computations. But as soon as there are combinatorial numbers of possibilities, no such &#8220;table-lookup-style&#8221; approach will work. And so, yes, just like humans, it&#8217;s time then for neural nets to &#8220;reach out&#8221; and use actual computational tools. (And, yes, <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\">Wolfram|Alpha</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> are <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\">uniquely suitable</a>, because they&#8217;ve been built to &#8220;talk about things in the world&#8221;, just like the language-model neural nets.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-really-lets-chatgpt-work?\">What Really Lets ChatGPT Work?</h2>\n<p>Human language—and the processes of thinking involved in generating it—have always seemed to represent a kind of pinnacle of complexity. And indeed it&#8217;s seemed somewhat remarkable that human brains—with their network of a &#8220;mere&#8221; 100 billion or so neurons (and maybe 100 trillion connections) could be responsible for it. Perhaps, one might have imagined, there&#8217;s something more to brains than their networks of neurons—like some new layer of undiscovered physics. But now with ChatGPT we&#8217;ve got an important new piece of information: we know that a pure, artificial neural network with about as many connections as brains have neurons is capable of doing a surprisingly good job of generating human language.</p>\n<p>And, yes, that&#8217;s still a big and complicated system—with about as many neural net weights as there are words of text currently available out there in the world. But at some level it still seems difficult to believe that all the richness of language and the things it can talk about can be encapsulated in such a finite system. Part of what&#8217;s going on is no doubt a reflection of the ubiquitous phenomenon (that first became evident in the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave\">example of rule 30</a>) that computational processes can in effect greatly amplify the apparent complexity of systems even when their underlying rules are simple. But, actually, as we discussed above, neural nets of the kind used in ChatGPT tend to be specifically constructed to restrict the effect of this phenomenon—and the computational irreducibility associated with it—in the interest of making their training more accessible.</p>\n<p>So how is it, then, that something like ChatGPT can get as far as it does with language? The basic answer, I think, is that language is at a fundamental level somehow simpler than it seems. And this means that ChatGPT—even with its ultimately straightforward neural net structure—is successfully able to &#8220;capture the essence&#8221; of human language and the thinking behind it. And moreover, in its training, ChatGPT has somehow &#8220;implicitly discovered&#8221; whatever regularities in language (and thinking) make this possible.</p>\n<p>The success of ChatGPT is, I think, giving us evidence of a fundamental and important piece of science: it&#8217;s suggesting that we can expect there to be major new &#8220;laws of language&#8221;—and effectively &#8220;laws of thought&#8221;—out there to discover. In ChatGPT—built as it is as a neural net—those laws are at best implicit. But if we could somehow make the laws explicit, there&#8217;s the potential to do the kinds of things ChatGPT does in vastly more direct, efficient—and transparent—ways.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so what might these laws be like? Ultimately they must give us some kind of prescription for how language—and the things we say with it—are put together. Later we&#8217;ll discuss how &#8220;looking inside ChatGPT&#8221; may be able to give us some hints about this, and how what we know from building computational language suggests a path forward. But first let&#8217;s discuss two long-known examples of what amount to &#8220;laws of language&#8221;—and how they relate to the operation of ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>The first is the syntax of language. Language is not just a random jumble of words. Instead, there are (fairly) definite <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--computer-and-human-languages/\">grammatical rules</a> for how words of different kinds can be put together: in English, for example, nouns can be preceded by adjectives and followed by verbs, but typically two nouns can&#8217;t be right next to each other. Such grammatical structure can (at least approximately) be captured by a set of rules that define how what amount to <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TextStructure.html\">&#8220;parse trees&#8221; can be put together</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img96_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img96.png' alt='' title='' width='613' height='262'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>ChatGPT doesn&#8217;t have any explicit &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of such rules. But somehow in its training it implicitly &#8220;discovers&#8221; them—and then seems to be good at following them. So how does this work? At a &#8220;big picture&#8221; level it&#8217;s not clear. But to get some insight it&#8217;s perhaps instructive to look at a much simpler example.</p>\n<p>Consider a &#8220;language&#8221; formed from sequences of (&#8217;s and )&#8217;s, with a <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-9--nested-lists/\">grammar that specifies</a> that parentheses should always be balanced, as represented by a parse tree like:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img97_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img97.png' alt='' title='' width='531' height='123'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Can we train a neural net to produce &#8220;grammatically correct&#8221; parenthesis sequences? There are various ways to handle sequences in neural nets, but let&#8217;s use transformer nets, as ChatGPT does. And given a simple transformer net, we can start feeding it grammatically correct parenthesis sequences as training examples. A subtlety (which actually also appears in ChatGPT&#8217;s generation of human language) is that in addition to our &#8220;content tokens&#8221; (here &#8220;(&#8221; and &#8220;)&#8221;) we have to include an &#8220;End&#8221; token, that&#8217;s generated to indicate that the output shouldn&#8217;t continue any further (i.e. for ChatGPT, that one&#8217;s reached the &#8220;end of the story&#8221;).</p>\n<p>If we set up a transformer net with just one attention block with 8 heads and feature vectors of length 128 (ChatGPT also uses feature vectors of length 128, but has 96 attention blocks, each with 96 heads) then it doesn&#8217;t seem possible to get it to learn much about parenthesis language. But with 2 attention blocks, the learning process seems to converge—at least after 10 million or so examples have been given (and, as is common with transformer nets, showing yet more examples just seems to degrade its performance).</p>\n<p>So with this network, we can do the analog of what ChatGPT does, and ask for probabilities for what the next token should be—in a parenthesis sequence:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img98_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img98.png' alt='' title='' width='503' height='83'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And in the first case, the network is &#8220;pretty sure&#8221; that the sequence can&#8217;t end here—which is good, because if it did, the parentheses would be left unbalanced. In the second case, however, it &#8220;correctly recognizes&#8221; that the sequence can end here, though it also &#8220;points out&#8221; that it&#8217;s possible to &#8220;start again&#8221;, putting down a &#8220;(&#8221;, presumably with a &#8220;)&#8221; to follow. But, oops, even with its 400,000 or so laboriously trained weights, it says there&#8217;s a 15% probability to have &#8220;)&#8221; as the next token—which isn&#8217;t right, because that would necessarily lead to an unbalanced parenthesis.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what we get if we ask the network for the highest-probability completions for progressively longer sequences of (&#8217;s:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img99_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img99A.png' alt='' title='' width='341' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, up to a certain length the network does just fine. But then it starts failing. It&#8217;s a pretty typical kind of thing to see in a &#8220;precise&#8221; situation like this with a neural net (or with machine learning in general). Cases that a human &#8220;can solve in a glance&#8221; the neural net can solve too. But cases that require doing something &#8220;more algorithmic&#8221; (e.g. explicitly counting parentheses to see if they&#8217;re closed) the neural net tends to somehow be &#8220;too computationally shallow&#8221; to reliably do. (By the way, even the full current ChatGPT has a hard time correctly matching parentheses in long sequences.)</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for things like ChatGPT and the syntax of a language like English? The parenthesis language is &#8220;austere&#8221;—and much more of an &#8220;algorithmic story&#8221;. But in English it&#8217;s much more realistic to be able to &#8220;guess&#8221; what&#8217;s grammatically going to fit on the basis of local choices of words and other hints. And, yes, the neural net is much better at this—even though perhaps it might miss some &#8220;formally correct&#8221; case that, well, humans might miss as well. But the main point is that the fact that there&#8217;s an overall syntactic structure to the language—with all the regularity that implies—in a sense limits &#8220;how much&#8221; the neural net has to learn. And a key &#8220;natural-science-like&#8221; observation is that the transformer architecture of neural nets like the one in ChatGPT seems to successfully be able to learn the kind of nested-tree-like syntactic structure that seems to exist (at least in some approximation) in all human languages.</p>\n<p>Syntax provides one kind of constraint on language. But there are clearly more. A sentence like &#8220;Inquisitive electrons eat blue theories for fish&#8221; is grammatically correct but isn&#8217;t something one would normally expect to say, and wouldn&#8217;t be considered a success if ChatGPT generated it—because, well, with the normal meanings for the words in it, it&#8217;s basically meaningless. </p>\n<p>But is there a general way to tell if a sentence is meaningful? There&#8217;s no traditional overall theory for that. But it&#8217;s something that one can think of ChatGPT as having implicitly &#8220;developed a theory for&#8221; after being trained with billions of (presumably meaningful) sentences from the web, etc. </p>\n<p>What might this theory be like? Well, there&#8217;s one tiny corner that&#8217;s basically been known for two millennia, and that&#8217;s <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/\">logic</a>. And certainly in the syllogistic form in which Aristotle discovered it, logic is basically a way of saying that sentences that follow certain patterns are reasonable, while others are not. Thus, for example, it&#8217;s reasonable to say &#8220;All X are Y. This is not Y, so it&#8217;s not an X&#8221; (as in &#8220;All fishes are blue. This is not blue, so it&#8217;s not a fish.&#8221;). And just as one can somewhat whimsically imagine that Aristotle discovered syllogistic logic by going (&#8220;machine-learning-style&#8221;) through lots of examples of rhetoric, so too one can imagine that in the training of ChatGPT it will have been able to &#8220;discover syllogistic logic&#8221; by looking at lots of text on the web, etc. (And, yes, while one can therefore expect ChatGPT to produce text that contains &#8220;correct inferences&#8221; based on things like syllogistic logic, it&#8217;s a quite different story when it comes to more sophisticated formal logic—and I think one can expect it to fail here for the same kind of reasons it fails in parenthesis matching.)</p>\n<p>But beyond the narrow example of logic, what can be said about how to systematically construct (or recognize) even plausibly meaningful text? Yes, there are things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mad Libs</a> that use very specific &#8220;phrasal templates&#8221;. But somehow ChatGPT implicitly has a much more general way to do it. And perhaps there&#8217;s nothing to be said about how it can be done beyond &#8220;somehow it happens when you have 175 billion neural net weights&#8221;. But I strongly suspect that there&#8217;s a much simpler and stronger story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meaning-space-and-semantic-laws-of-motion\">Meaning Space and Semantic Laws of Motion</h2>\n<p>We discussed above that inside ChatGPT any piece of text is effectively represented by an array of numbers that we can think of as coordinates of a point in some kind of &#8220;linguistic feature space&#8221;. So when ChatGPT continues a piece of text this corresponds to tracing out a trajectory in linguistic feature space. But now we can ask what makes this trajectory correspond to text we consider meaningful. And might there perhaps be some kind of &#8220;semantic laws of motion&#8221; that define—or at least constrain—how points in linguistic feature space can move around while preserving &#8220;meaningfulness&#8221;?</p>\n<p>So what is this linguistic feature space like? Here&#8217;s an example of how single words (here, common nouns) might get laid out if we project such a feature space down to 2D:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img100_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img100.png' alt='' title='' width='558' height='524'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>We saw another example above based on words representing plants and animals. But the point in both cases is that &#8220;semantically similar words&#8221; are placed nearby.</p>\n<p>As another example, here&#8217;s how words corresponding to different parts of speech get laid out:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img101_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img101-edit.png' alt='' title='' width='575' height=''> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Of course, a given word doesn&#8217;t in general just have &#8220;one meaning&#8221; (or necessarily correspond to just one part of speech). And by looking at how sentences containing a word lay out in feature space, one can often &#8220;tease apart&#8221; different meanings—as in the example here for the word &#8220;crane&#8221; (bird or machine?):</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img102_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img102.png' alt='' title='' width='593' height='364'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>OK, so it&#8217;s at least plausible that we can think of this feature space as placing &#8220;words nearby in meaning&#8221; close in this space. But what kind of additional structure can we identify in this space? Is there for example some kind of notion of &#8220;parallel transport&#8221; that would reflect &#8220;flatness&#8221; in the space? One way to get a handle on that is to look at analogies:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img103_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img103.png' alt='' title='' width='552' height='279'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, even when we project down to 2D, there&#8217;s often at least a &#8220;hint of flatness&#8221;, though it&#8217;s certainly not universally seen.</p>\n<p>So what about trajectories? We can look at the trajectory that a prompt for ChatGPT follows in feature space—and then we can see how ChatGPT continues that:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img104_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img104.png' alt='' title='' width='549' height='339'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s certainly no &#8220;geometrically obvious&#8221; law of motion here. And that&#8217;s not at all surprising; we fully expect this to be a <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics\">considerably more complicated story</a>. And, for example, it&#8217;s far from obvious that even if there is a &#8220;semantic law of motion&#8221; to be found, what kind of embedding (or, in effect, what &#8220;variables&#8221;) it&#8217;ll most naturally be stated in. </p>\n<p>In the picture above, we&#8217;re showing several steps in the &#8220;trajectory&#8221;—where at each step we&#8217;re picking the word that ChatGPT considers the most probable (the &#8220;zero temperature&#8221; case). But we can also ask what words can &#8220;come next&#8221; with what probabilities at a given point:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img105_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img105.png' alt='' title='' width='359' height='227'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And what we see in this case is that there&#8217;s a &#8220;fan&#8221; of high-probability words that seems to go in a more or less definite direction in feature space. What happens if we go further? Here are the successive &#8220;fans&#8221; that appear as we &#8220;move along&#8221; the trajectory:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img106_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img106.png' alt='' title='' width='578' height='566'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a 3D representation, going for a total of 40 steps:</p>\n<div>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img107_copy.txt' data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw021423img107.png' alt='' title='' width='359' height='294'> </div>\n</p></div>\n<p>And, yes, this seems like a mess—and doesn&#8217;t do anything to particularly encourage the idea that one can expect to identify &#8220;mathematical-physics-like&#8221; &#8220;semantic laws of motion&#8221; by empirically studying &#8220;what ChatGPT is doing inside&#8221;. But perhaps we&#8217;re just looking at the &#8220;wrong variables&#8221; (or wrong coordinate system) and if only we looked at the right one, we&#8217;d immediately see that ChatGPT is doing something &#8220;mathematical-physics-simple&#8221; like following geodesics. But as of now, we&#8217;re not ready to &#8220;empirically decode&#8221; from its &#8220;internal behavior&#8221; what ChatGPT has &#8220;discovered&#8221; about how human language is &#8220;put together&#8221;. </p>\n<h2 id=\"semantic-grammar-and-the-power-of-computational-language\">Semantic Grammar and the Power of Computational Language</h2>\n<p>What does it take to produce &#8220;meaningful human language&#8221;? In the past, we might have assumed it could be nothing short of a human brain. But now we know it can be done quite respectably by the neural net of ChatGPT. Still, maybe that&#8217;s as far as we can go, and there&#8217;ll be nothing simpler—or more human understandable—that will work. But my strong suspicion is that the success of ChatGPT implicitly reveals an important &#8220;scientific&#8221; fact: that there&#8217;s actually a lot more structure and simplicity to meaningful human language than we ever knew—and that in the end there may be even fairly simple rules that describe how such language can be put together.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, syntactic grammar gives rules for how words corresponding to things like different parts of speech can be put together in human language. But to deal with meaning, we need to go further. And one version of how to do this is to think about not just a syntactic grammar for language, but also a semantic one. </p>\n<p>For purposes of syntax, we identify things like nouns and verbs. But for purposes of semantics, we need &#8220;finer gradations&#8221;. So, for example, we might identify the concept of &#8220;moving&#8221;, and the concept of an &#8220;object&#8221; that &#8220;maintains its identity independent of location&#8221;. There are endless specific examples of each of these &#8220;semantic concepts&#8221;. But for the purposes of our semantic grammar, we&#8217;ll just have some general kind of rule that basically says that &#8220;objects&#8221; can &#8220;move&#8221;. There&#8217;s a lot to say about how all this might work (<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/\">some of which I&#8217;ve said before</a>). But I&#8217;ll content myself here with just a few remarks that indicate some of the potential path forward.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that even if a sentence is perfectly OK according to the semantic grammar, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s been realized (or even could be realized) in practice. &#8220;The elephant traveled to the Moon&#8221; would doubtless &#8220;pass&#8221; our semantic grammar, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t been realized (at least yet) in our actual world—though it&#8217;s absolutely fair game for a fictional world.</p>\n<p>When we start talking about &#8220;semantic grammar&#8221; we&#8217;re soon led to ask &#8220;What&#8217;s underneath it?&#8221; What &#8220;model of the world&#8221; is it assuming? A syntactic grammar is really just about the construction of language from words. But a semantic grammar necessarily engages with some kind of &#8220;model of the world&#8221;—something that serves as a &#8220;skeleton&#8221; on top of which language made from actual words can be layered.</p>\n<p>Until recent times, we might have imagined that (human) language would be the only general way to describe our &#8220;model of the world&#8221;. Already a few centuries ago there started to be formalizations of specific kinds of things, based particularly on mathematics. But now there&#8217;s a much more general approach to formalization: <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/\">computational language</a>.</p>\n<p>And, yes, that&#8217;s been my big project over the course of more than four decades (as now embodied in the <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a>): to develop a precise symbolic representation that can talk as broadly as possible about things in the world, as well as abstract things that we care about. And so, for example, we have symbolic representations for <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/City.html\">cities</a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MolecularStructureAndComputation.html\">molecules</a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ImageRepresentation.html\">images</a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/NeuralNetworkConstruction.html\">neural networks</a>, and we have built-in knowledge about how to compute about those things. </p>\n<p>And, after decades of work, we&#8217;ve covered a lot of areas in this way. But in the past, we haven&#8217;t particularly dealt with &#8220;<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/\">everyday discourse</a>&#8221;. In &#8220;I bought two pounds of apples&#8221; we can <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/Food.html\">readily represent</a> (and do nutrition and other computations on) the &#8220;two pounds of apples&#8221;. But we don&#8217;t (quite yet) have a symbolic representation for &#8220;I bought&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all connected to the idea of semantic grammar—and the goal of having a generic symbolic &#8220;construction kit&#8221; for concepts, that would give us rules for what could fit together with what, and thus for the &#8220;flow&#8221; of what we might turn into human language. </p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s say we had this &#8220;symbolic discourse language&#8221;. What would we do with it? We could start off doing things like generating &#8220;locally meaningful text&#8221;. But ultimately we&#8217;re likely to want more &#8220;globally meaningful&#8221; results—which means &#8220;computing&#8221; more about what can actually exist or happen in the world (or perhaps in some consistent fictional world). </p>\n<p>Right now in Wolfram Language we have a huge amount of built-in computational knowledge about lots of kinds of things. But for a complete symbolic discourse language we&#8217;d have to build in additional &#8220;calculi&#8221; about general things in the world: if an object moves from A to B and from B to C, then it&#8217;s moved from A to C, etc. </p>\n<p>Given a symbolic discourse language we might use it to make &#8220;standalone statements&#8221;. But we can also use it to ask questions about the world, &#8220;Wolfram|Alpha style&#8221;. Or we can use it to state things that we &#8220;want to make so&#8221;, presumably with some external actuation mechanism. Or we can use it to make assertions—perhaps about the actual world, or perhaps about some specific world we&#8217;re considering, fictional or otherwise. </p>\n<p>Human language is fundamentally imprecise, not least because it isn&#8217;t &#8220;tethered&#8221; to a specific computational implementation, and its meaning is basically defined just by a &#8220;social contract&#8221; between its users. But computational language, by its nature, has a certain fundamental precision—because in the end what it specifies can always be &#8220;unambiguously executed on a computer&#8221;. Human language can usually get away with a certain vagueness. (When we say &#8220;planet&#8221; does it include exoplanets or not, etc.?) But in computational language we have to be precise and clear about all the distinctions we&#8217;re making.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s often convenient to leverage ordinary human language in making up names in computational language. But the meanings they have in computational language are necessarily precise—and might or might not cover some particular connotation in typical human language usage.</p>\n<p>How should one figure out the fundamental &#8220;ontology&#8221; suitable for a general symbolic discourse language? Well, it&#8217;s not easy. Which is perhaps why little has been done since the primitive beginnings Aristotle made more than two millennia ago. But it really helps that today we now know so much about how to think about the world computationally (and it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have a &#8220;fundamental metaphysics&#8221; from our <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Physics Project</a> and the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/\">idea of the ruliad</a>).</p>\n<p>But what does all this mean in the context of ChatGPT? From its training ChatGPT has effectively &#8220;pieced together&#8221; a certain (rather impressive) quantity of what amounts to semantic grammar. But its very success gives us a reason to think that it&#8217;s going to be feasible to construct something more complete in computational language form. And, unlike what we&#8217;ve so far figured out about the innards of ChatGPT, we can expect to design the computational language so that it&#8217;s readily understandable to humans.</p>\n<p>When we talk about semantic grammar, we can draw an analogy to syllogistic logic. At first, syllogistic logic was essentially a collection of rules about statements expressed in human language. But (yes, two millennia later) <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-history\">when formal logic was developed</a>, the original basic constructs of syllogistic logic could now be used to build huge &#8220;formal towers&#8221; that include, for example, the operation of modern digital circuitry. And so, we can expect, it will be with more general semantic grammar. At first, it may just be able to deal with simple patterns, expressed, say, as text. But once its whole computational language framework is built, we can expect that it will be able to be used to erect tall towers of &#8220;generalized semantic logic&#8221;, that allow us to work in a precise and formal way with all sorts of things that have never been accessible to us before, except just at a &#8220;ground-floor level&#8221; through human language, with all its vagueness.</p>\n<p>We can think of the construction of computational language—and semantic grammar—as representing a kind of ultimate compression in representing things. Because it allows us to talk about the essence of what&#8217;s possible, without, for example, dealing with all the &#8220;turns of phrase&#8221; that exist in ordinary human language. And we can view the great strength of ChatGPT as being something a bit similar: because it too has in a sense &#8220;drilled through&#8221; to the point where it can &#8220;put language together in a semantically meaningful way&#8221; without concern for different possible turns of phrase.</p>\n<p>So what would happen if we applied ChatGPT to underlying computational language? The computational language can describe what&#8217;s possible. But what can still be added is a sense of &#8220;what&#8217;s popular&#8221;—based for example on reading all that content on the web. But then—underneath—operating with computational language means that something like ChatGPT has immediate and fundamental access to what amount to ultimate tools for making use of potentially irreducible computations. And that makes it a system that can not only &#8220;generate reasonable text&#8221;, but can expect to work out whatever can be worked out about whether that text actually makes &#8220;correct&#8221; statements about the world—or whatever it&#8217;s supposed to be talking about. </p>\n<h2 id=\"so-...-what-is-chatgpt-doing,-and-why-does-it-work?\">So &#8230; What Is ChatGPT Doing, and Why Does It Work?</h2>\n<p>The basic concept of ChatGPT is at some level rather simple. Start from a huge sample of human-created text from the web, books, etc. Then train a neural net to generate text that&#8217;s &#8220;like this&#8221;. And in particular, make it able to start from a &#8220;prompt&#8221; and then continue with text that&#8217;s &#8220;like what it&#8217;s been trained with&#8221;.</p>\n<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, the actual neural net in ChatGPT is made up of very simple elements—though billions of them. And the basic operation of the neural net is also very simple, consisting essentially of passing input derived from the text it&#8217;s generated so far &#8220;once through its elements&#8221; (without any loops, etc.) for every new word (or part of a word) that it generates.</p>\n<p>But the remarkable—and unexpected—thing is that this process can produce text that&#8217;s successfully &#8220;like&#8221; what&#8217;s out there on the web, in books, etc. And not only is it coherent human language, it also &#8220;says things&#8221; that &#8220;follow its prompt&#8221; making use of content it&#8217;s &#8220;read&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t always say things that &#8220;globally make sense&#8221; (or correspond to correct <nobr>computations)—</nobr>because (without, for example, <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\">accessing the &#8220;computational superpowers&#8221; of Wolfram|Alpha</a>) it&#8217;s just saying things that &#8220;sound right&#8221; based on what things &#8220;sounded like&#8221; in its training material. </p>\n<p>The specific engineering of ChatGPT has made it quite compelling. But ultimately (at least until it can use outside tools) ChatGPT is &#8220;merely&#8221; pulling out some &#8220;coherent thread of text&#8221; from the &#8220;statistics of conventional wisdom&#8221; that it&#8217;s accumulated. But it&#8217;s amazing how human-like the results are. And as I&#8217;ve discussed, this suggests something that&#8217;s at least scientifically very important: that human language (and the patterns of thinking behind it) are somehow simpler and more &#8220;law like&#8221; in their structure than we thought. ChatGPT has implicitly discovered it. But we can potentially explicitly expose it, with semantic grammar, computational language, etc.</p>\n<p>What ChatGPT does in generating text is very impressive—and the results are usually very much like what we humans would produce. So does this mean ChatGPT is working like a brain? Its underlying artificial-neural-net structure was ultimately modeled on an idealization of the brain. And it seems quite likely that when we humans generate language many aspects of what&#8217;s going on are quite similar.</p>\n<p>When it comes to training (AKA learning) the different &#8220;hardware&#8221; of the brain and of current computers (as well as, perhaps, some undeveloped algorithmic ideas) forces ChatGPT to use a strategy that&#8217;s probably rather different (and in some ways much less efficient) than the brain. And there&#8217;s something else as well: unlike even in typical algorithmic computation, ChatGPT doesn&#8217;t internally &#8220;have loops&#8221; or &#8220;recompute on data&#8221;. And that inevitably limits its computational capability—even with respect to current computers, but definitely with respect to the brain.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear how to &#8220;fix that&#8221; and still maintain the ability to train the system with reasonable efficiency. But to do so will presumably allow a future ChatGPT to do even more &#8220;brain-like things&#8221;. Of course, there are plenty of things that brains don&#8217;t do so well<span style=\"font-size:14px\">—</span>particularly involving what amount to irreducible computations. And for these both brains and things like ChatGPT have to seek &#8220;outside tools&#8221;—like <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a>.</p>\n<p>But for now it&#8217;s exciting to see what ChatGPT has already been able to do. At some level it&#8217;s a great example of the fundamental scientific fact that large numbers of simple computational elements can do remarkable and unexpected things. But it also provides perhaps the best impetus we&#8217;ve had in two thousand years to understand better just what the fundamental character and principles might be of that central feature of the human condition that is human language and the processes of thinking behind it.</p>\n<h2 id='thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>I&#8217;ve been following the development of neural nets now for about 43 years, and during that time I&#8217;ve interacted with many people about them.

Mechanical work irreversibly turns into heat. The Second Law of thermodynamics is considered one of the great general principles of physical science. But 150 years <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>after it was first introduced</a>, there’s still something deeply mysterious about the Second Law. It almost seems like it’s going to be “provably true”. But one <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--current-thinking-on-the-second-law/'>never quite gets there</a>; it always seems to need something extra. Sometimes textbooks will gloss over everything; sometimes they’ll give some kind of “common-sense-but-outside-of-physics argument”. But the mystery of the Second Law has never gone away.</p>\n<p>Why does the Second Law work? And does it even in fact always work, or is it actually sometimes violated? What does it really depend on? What would be needed to “prove it”? </p>\n<p>For me personally the quest to understand the Second Law has been no less than a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>50-year story</a>. But back in the 1980s, as I began to explore the computational universe of simple programs, I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>discovered a fundamental phenomenon</a> that was immediately reminiscent of the Second Law. And in the 1990s I started to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>map out just how this phenomenon might</a> finally be able to demystify the Second Law. But it is only now—with ideas that have emerged from our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>—that I think I can pull all the pieces together and finally be able to construct a proper framework to explain why—and to what extent—the Second Law is true.<span id=\"more-43551\"></span></p>\n<p>In its usual conception, the Second Law is a law of thermodynamics, concerned with the dynamics of heat. But it turns out that there’s a vast generalization of it that’s possible. And in fact my key realization is that the Second Law is ultimately just a manifestation of the very same core computational phenomenon that is at the heart of our Physics Project and indeed the whole conception of science that is emerging from our study of the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a> and the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s all a story of the interplay between underlying <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> and our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>nature as computationally bounded observers</a>. Other observers—or even our own future technology—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>might see things differently</a>. But at least for us now the ubiquity of computational irreducibility leads inexorably to the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p315--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness/'>generation of behavior</a> that we—with our computationally bounded nature—will <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p552--defining-the-notion-of-randomness/'>read as &#8220;random”</a>. We might start from something highly ordered (like gas molecules all in the corner of a box) but soon—at least as far as we’re concerned—it will typically seem to “randomize”, just as the Second Law implies.</p>\n<p>In the twentieth century there emerged three great physical theories: general relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, with the Second Law being the defining phenomenon of statistical mechanics. But while there was a sense that statistical mechanics (and in particular the Second Law) should somehow be “formally derivable”, general relativity and quantum mechanics seemed quite different. But our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project has changed that picture</a>. And the remarkable thing is that it now seems as if all three of general relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics are actually derivable, and from the same ultimate foundation: the interplay between computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of observers like us.</p>\n<p>The case of statistical mechanics and the Second Law is in some ways simpler than the other two because in statistical mechanics it’s realistic to separate the observer from the system they’re observing, while in general relativity and quantum mechanics it’s essential that the observer be an integral part of the system. It also helps that phenomena about things like molecules in statistical mechanics are much more familiar to us today than those about atoms of space or branches of multiway systems. And by studying the Second Law we’ll be able to develop intuition that we can use elsewhere, say in discussing “molecular” vs. “fluid” levels of description in my recent exploration of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>physicalization of the foundations of metamathematics</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>The Core Phenomenon of the Second Law</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1019b/'>earliest statements of the Second Law</a> were things like: “Heat doesn’t flow from a colder body to a hotter one” or “You can’t systematically purely convert heat to mechanical work”. Later on there came the somewhat more abstract statement “Entropy tends to increase”. But in the end, all these statements boil down to the same idea: that somehow things always tend to get progressively “more random”. What may start in an orderly state will—according to the Second Law—inexorably “degrade” to a “randomized” state.</p>\n<p>But how general is this phenomenon? Does it just apply to heat and temperature and molecules and things? Or is it something that applies across a whole range of kinds of systems? </p>\n<p>The answer, I believe, is that underneath the Second Law there’s a very general phenomenon that’s extremely robust. And that has the potential to apply to pretty much any kind of system one can imagine. </p>\n<p>Here’s a longtime favorite example of mine: <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>the rule 30 cellular automaton</a>:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img1_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img1B.png\" alt='' title='' width='595' height=''> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Start from a simple “orderly” state, here containing just a single non-white cell. Then apply the rule over and over again. The pattern that emerges has some definite, visible structure. But many aspects of it “seem random”. Just as in the Second Law, even starting from something “orderly”, one ends up getting something “random”.</p>\n<p>But is it “really random”? It’s completely determined by the initial condition and rule, and you can always recompute it. But the subtle yet critical point is that if you’re just given the output, it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes/'>can still &#8220;seem random&#8221;</a> in the sense that no known methods operating purely on this output can find regularities in it.</p>\n<p>It’s reminiscent of the situation with something like the digits of π. There’s a fairly simple algorithm for generating these digits. Yet once generated, the digits on their own seem for practical purposes random.</p>\n<p>In studying physical systems there’s a long history of assuming that whenever randomness is seen, it somehow comes from outside the system. Maybe it’s the effect of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-3--randomness-from-the-environment'>&#8220;thermal noise&#8221; or &#8220;perturbations&#8221;</a> acting on the system. Maybe it’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-4--chaos-theory-and-randomness-from-initial-conditions'>chaos-theory-style &#8220;excavation&#8221;</a> of higher-order digits supplied through real-number initial conditions. But the surprising <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/origins-randomness-physical-systems.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>discovery I made in the 1980s</a> by looking at things like rule 30 is that actually no such “external source” is needed: instead, it’s perfectly possible for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-5--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness'>randomness to be generated intrinsically</a> within a system just through the process of applying definite underlying rules.</p>\n<p>How can one understand this? The key is to think in computational terms. And ultimately the source of the phenomenon is the interplay between the computational process associated with the actual evolution of the system and the computational processes that our perception of the output of that evolution brings to bear.</p>\n<p>We might have thought if a system had a simple underlying rule—like rule 30—then it’d always be straightforward to predict what the system will do. Of course, we could in principle always just run the rule and see what happens. But the question is whether we can expect to “jump ahead” and “find the outcome”, with much less computational effort than the actual evolution of the system involves.</p>\n<p>And an important conclusion of a lot of science I did in the 1980s and 1990s is that for many systems—presumably including rule 30—it’s simply not possible to “jump ahead”. And instead the evolution of the system is what I call <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computationally irreducible</a>—so that it takes an irreducible amount of computational effort to find out what the system does. </p>\n<p>Ultimately this is a consequence of what I call the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>, which states that above some low threshold, systems always end up being equivalent in the sophistication of the computations they perform. And this is why even our brains and our most sophisticated methods of scientific analysis can’t “computationally outrun” even something like rule 30, so that we must consider it computationally irreducible.</p>\n<p>So how does this relate to the Second Law? It’s what makes it possible for a system like rule 30 to operate according to a simple underlying rule, yet to intrinsically generate what seems like random behavior. If we could do all the necessary computationally irreducible work then we could in principle “see through” to the simple rules underneath. But the key point (emphasized by our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>) is that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers like us are computationally bounded</a> in our capabilities. And this means that we’re not able to “see through the computational irreducibility”—with the result that the behavior we see “looks random to us”.</p>\n<p>And in thermodynamics that “random-looking” behavior is what we associate with heat. And the Second Law assertion that energy associated with systematic mechanical work tends to “degrade into heat” then corresponds to the fact that when there’s computational irreducibility the behavior that’s generated is something we can’t readily “computationally see through”—so that it appears random to us.</p>\n<h2 id='the-road-from-ordinary-thermodynamics'>The Road from Ordinary Thermodynamics</h2>\n<p>Systems like rule 30 make the phenomenon of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-5--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness'>intrinsic randomness generation</a> particularly clear. But how do such systems relate to the ones that thermodynamics usually studies? The original formulation of the Second Law involved gases, and the vast majority of its applications even today still concern things like gases.</p>\n<p>At a basic level, a typical gas consists of a collection of discrete molecules that interact through collisions. And as an idealization of this, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>we can consider hard spheres</a> that move according to the standard laws of mechanics and undergo perfectly elastic collisions with each other, and with the walls of a container. Here’s an example of a sequence of snapshots from a <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/HardSphereSimulation'>simulation of such a system</a>, done in 2D: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img2_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img2.png\" alt='' title='' width='571' height='454'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>We begin with an organized “flotilla” of “molecules”, systematically going in a particular direction (and not touching, to avoid a “Newton’s Cradle” many-collisions-at-a-time effect). But after these molecules collide with a wall, they quickly start to move in what seem like much more random ways. The original systematic motion is like what happens when one is “doing mechanical work”, say moving a solid object. But what we see is that—just as the Second Law implies—this motion is quickly “degraded” into disordered and seemingly random “heat-like” microscopic motion.</p>\n<p>Here’s a “spacetime” view of the behavior:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img3_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img3.png\" alt='' title='' width='549' height='286'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Looking from far away, with each molecule’s spacetime trajectory shown as a slightly transparent tube, we get:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img4_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img4.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='216'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>There’s already some qualitative similarity with the rule 30 behavior we saw above. But there are many detailed differences. And one of the most obvious is that while rule 30 just has a discrete collection of cells, the spheres in the hard-sphere gas can be at any position. And, what’s more, the precise details of their positions can have an increasingly large effect. If two elastic spheres collide perfectly head on, they’ll bounce back the way they came.

And, needless to say, being set up like rule 30 it shows the same kind of intrinsic randomness generation that we see in a system like rule 30. </p>\n<p>We started here from a “physically realistic” hard-sphere gas model—which we’ve kept on simplifying and idealizing.

But what we’ve discovered is that this isn’t the case. And instead we’ve got evidence that the core phenomenon is much more robust and in a sense purely computational. </p>\n<p>Indeed, it seems that as soon as there’s computational irreducibility in a system, it’s basically inevitable that we’ll see the phenomenon. And since from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> we expect that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> is ubiquitous, the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-3--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>core phenomenon of the Second Law</a> will in the end be ubiquitous across a vast range of systems, from things like hard-sphere gases to things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>rule 30</a>. </p>\n<h2 id='reversibility,-irreversibility-and-equilibrium'>Reversibility, Irreversibility and Equilibrium</h2>\n<p>Our typical everyday experience shows a certain fundamental irreversibility.

But there’s immediately something mysterious about this. Yes, there’s irreversibility at the level of things like eggs. But if we drill down to the level of atoms, the physics we know says <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--time-reversal-invariance/'>there&#8217;s basically perfect reversibility</a>. So where is the irreversibility coming from?

Yet we saw above that if we start from a “simple initial condition” and then just run the rule, it will “produce increasing randomness”. But what if we reverse the rule, and run it backwards? Well, since the rule is reversible, the same thing must happen: we must get increasing randomness. But how can it be that “randomness increases” both going forward in time and going backward? Here’s a picture that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p443--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>shows what&#8217;s going on</a>: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img50_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img50.png\" alt='' title='' width='551' height='375'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>In the middle the system takes on a “simple state”. But going either forward or backward it “randomizes”. The second half of the evolution we can interpret as typical Second-Law-style “degradation to randomness”. But what about the first half? Something unexpected is happening here. From what seems like a “rather random” initial state, the system appears to be “spontaneously organizing itself” to produce—at least temporarily—a simple and “orderly” state. An initial “scrambled” state is spontaneously becoming “unscrambled”. In the setup of ordinary thermodynamics, this would be a kind of “anti-thermodynamic” behavior in which what seems like “random heat” is spontaneously generating “organized mechanical work”.</p>\n<p>So why isn’t this what we see happening all the time? Microscopic reversibility guarantees that in principle it’s possible. But what leads to the observed Second Law is that in practice we just don’t normally end up setting up the kind of initial states that give “anti-thermodynamic” behavior. We’ll be talking at length below about why this is. But the basic point is that to do so requires more computational sophistication than we as computationally bounded observers can muster. If the evolution of the system is computationally irreducible, then in effect we have to invert all of that computationally irreducible work to find the initial state to use, and that’s not something that we—as computationally bounded observers—can do. </p>\n<p>But before we talk more about this, let’s explore some of the consequences of the basic setup we have here. The most obvious aspect of the “simple state” in the middle of the picture above is that it involves a big blob of “adjacent particles”. So now here’s a plot of the “size of the biggest blob that’s present” as a function of time starting from the “simple state”:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img51_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img51.png\" alt='' title='' width='373' height='135'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>The plot indicates that—as the picture above indicates—the “specialness” of the initial state quickly “decays” to a “typical state” in which there aren’t any large blobs present. And if we were watching the system at the beginning of this plot, we’d be able to “use the Second Law” to identify a definite “arrow of time”: later times are the ones where the states are “more disordered” in the sense that they only have smaller blobs.</p>\n<p>There are many subtleties to all of this. We know that if we set up an “appropriately special” initial state we can get anti-thermodynamic behavior. And indeed for the whole picture above—with its “special initial state”—the plot of blob size vs. time looks like this, with a symmetrical peak “developing” in the middle:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img52_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img52.png\" alt='' title='' width='529' height='101'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>We’ve “made this happen” by setting up “special initial conditions”. But can it happen “naturally”? To some extent, yes. Even away from the peak, we can see there are always little fluctuations: blobs being formed and destroyed as part of the evolution of the system. And if we wait long enough we may see a fairly large blob. Like here’s one that forms (and decays) after about 245,400 steps:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img53_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img53.png\" alt='' title='' width='373' height='128'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>The actual structure this corresponds to is pretty unremarkable:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img54_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img54.png\" alt='' title='' width='188' height='313'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>But, OK, away from the “special state”, what we see is a kind of “uniform randomness”, in which, for example, there’s no obvious distinction between forward and backward in time. In thermodynamic terms, we’d describe this as having “reached equilibrium”—a situation in which there’s no longer “obvious change”.</p>\n<p>To be fair, even in “equilibrium”, there will always be “fluctuations”. But for example in the system we’re looking at here, “fluctuations” corresponding to progressively larger blobs tend to occur exponentially less frequently. So it’s reasonable to think of there being an “equilibrium state” with certain unchanging “typical properties”. And, what’s more, that state is the basic outcome from any initial condition. Whatever special characteristics might have been present in the initial state will tend to be degraded away, leaving only the generic “equilibrium state”. </p>\n<p>One might think that the possibility of such an “equilibrium state” showing “typical behavior” would be a specific feature of microscopically reversible systems. But this isn’t the case. And much as the core phenomenon of the Second Law is actually something computational that’s deeper and more general than the specifics of particular physical systems, so also this is true of the core phenomenon of equilibrium. And indeed the presence of what we might call “computational equilibrium” turns out to be directly connected to the overall phenomenon of computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>Let’s look again at rule 30.

But the point is that the overall form of what’s produced is always the same: the system has reached a kind of “computational equilibrium” whose overall features are independent of where it came from. Later, we’ll see that the rapid emergence of “computational equilibrium” is characteristic of what I long ago identified as “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-2--four-classes-of-behavior'>class 3 systems</a>”—and it’s quite ubiquitous to systems with a wide range of underlying rules, microscopically reversible or not.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that microscopic reversibility is irrelevant to “Second-Law-like” behavior.

And in the discrete-state systems we’re discussing here the definition of perfect ergodicity is quite straightforward: ergodicity just implies that the state transition graph must consist not of many cycles, but instead purely of one big cycle—so that whatever state one starts from, one’s always guaranteed to eventually visit every possible other state. </p>\n<p>But why is this relevant to the Second Law? Well, we’ve said that the Second Law is about “degradation” from “special states” to “typical states”. And if one’s going to “do the ergodic thing” of visiting all possible states, then inevitably most of the states we’ll at least eventually pass through will be “typical”. </p>\n<p>But on its own, this definitely isn’t enough to explain “Second-Law behavior” in practice. In an example like the following, one sees rapid “degradation” of a simple initial state to something “random” and “typical”: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img77_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img77.png\" alt='' title='' width='108' height='326'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>But of the 2 x 3<sup>80</sup> &asymp; 10<sup>38</sup> possible states that this system would eventually visit if it were ergodic, there are still a huge number that we wouldn’t consider “typical” or “random”. For example, just knowing that the system is eventually ergodic doesn’t tell one that it wouldn’t start off by painstakingly “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p117--elementary-arithmetic/'>counting down</a>” like this, “keeping the action” in a tightly organized region:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img79_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img79.png\" alt='' title='' width='558' height='220'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>So somehow there’s more than ergodicity that’s needed to explain the “degradation to randomness” associated with “typical Second-Law behavior”.

But before we get there, let’s talk some more about “global structure”, as captured by things like state transition diagrams.</p>\n<p>Consider again the size-4 case above. The rules are such that they conserve the number of “particles” (i.e. non-white cells).

One might think that anything that is made by a simple-to-describe algorithm—like the pattern of rule 30 or the digits of π—shouldn’t really be considered “random”. But for the purpose of understanding our experience of the world what matters is not what is “happening underneath” but instead what our perception of it is. So the question becomes: when we see something produced, say by rule 30 or by π, can we <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p547--introduction/'>recognize regularities in it or not</a>?</p>\n<p>And in practice what the Second Law asserts is that systems will tend to go from states where we can recognize regularities to ones where we cannot.

And, yes, one can try <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>all sorts of methods</a> from <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-9--statistical-analysis'>statistics</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-12--human-thinking'>machine learning</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-10--cryptography-and-cryptanalysis'>cryptography</a> and so on. But so far as one can tell, none of them make any significant progress: the “encoding” associated with the evolution of the system seems to just be too strong to “break”. Ultimately it’s hard to know for sure that there’s no scheme that can work. But any scheme must correspond to running some program. So a way to get a bit more evidence is just to enumerate “possible compression programs” and see what they do. </p>\n<p>In particular, we can for example enumerate simple cellular automata, and see whether when run they produce “obviously different” results. Here’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p597--statistical-analysis/'>what happens for a collection of different cellular automata</a> when they are applied to a “simple initial condition”, to states obtained after 20 and 200 steps of evolution according to the particle cellular automaton rule and to an independently random state: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img110_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img110.png\" alt='' title='' width='572' height='564'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>And, yes, in many cases the simple initial condition leads to “obviously different behavior”. But there’s nothing obviously different about the behavior obtained in the last two cases. Or, in other words, at least programs based on these simple cellular automata don’t seem to be able to “decode” the different origins of the second and third cases shown here.</p>\n<p>What does all this mean? The fundamental point is that there seems to be enough computational irreducibility in the evolution of the system that no computationally bounded observer can “see through it”. And so—at least as far as a computationally bounded observer is concerned—“specialness” in the initial conditions is quickly “degraded” to an “equilibrium” state that “seems random”. Or, in other words, the computational process of evolution inevitably seems to lead to the core phenomenon of the Second Law.</p>\n<h2 id='the-concept-of-entropy'>The Concept of Entropy</h2>\n<p>“<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--history-of-thermodynamics/'>Entropy increases</a>” is a common statement of the Second Law. But what does this mean, especially in our computational context? The answer is somewhat subtle, and understanding it will put us right back into questions of the interplay between computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of observers.</p>\n<p>When it was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-entropy'>first introduced in the 1860s</a>, entropy was thought of very much like energy, and was computed from ratios of heat content to temperature. But soon—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>particularly through work on gases by Boltzmann</a>—there arose a quite different way of computing (and thinking about) entropy: in terms of the log of the number of possible states of a system. Later we’ll discuss the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-entropy'>correspondence between these different ideas of entropy</a>. But for now let’s consider what I view as the more fundamental definition based on counting states.</p>\n<p>In the early days of entropy, when one imagined that—like in the cases of the hard-sphere gas—the parameters of the system were continuous, it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>could be mathematically complex to tease out any kind of discrete &#8220;counting of states&#8221;</a>. But from what we’ve discussed here, it’s clear that the core phenomenon of the Second Law doesn’t depend on the presence of continuous parameters, and in something like a cellular automaton it’s basically straightforward to count discrete states.</p>\n<p>But now we have get more careful about our definition of entropy. Given any particular initial state, a deterministic system will always evolve through a series of individual states—so that there’s always only one possible state for the system, which means the entropy will always be exactly zero. (This is a lot muddier and more complicated when continuous parameters are considered, but in the end the conclusion is the same.) </p>\n<p>So how do we get a more useful definition of entropy? The key idea is to think not about individual states of a system but instead about collections of states that we somehow consider “equivalent”. In a typical case we might imagine that we can’t measure all the detailed positions of molecules in a gas, so we look just at “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p448--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>coarse-grained</a>” states in which we consider, say, only the number of molecules in particular overall bins or blocks.</p>\n<p>The entropy can be thought of as counting the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with some overall constraint—like a certain number of particles in each bin. If the constraint talks specifically about the position of every particle, there’ll only be one microscopic state consistent with the constraints, and the entropy will be zero. But if the constraint is looser, there’ll often be many possible microscopic states consistent with it, and the entropy we define will be nonzero.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at this in the context of our particle cellular automaton. Here’s a particular evolution, starting from a specific microscopic state, together with a sequence of “coarse grainings” of this evolution in which we keep track only of “overall particle density” in progressively larger blocks:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img111_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img111.png\" alt='' title='' width='415' height='227'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>The very first “coarse graining” here is particularly trivial: all it’s doing is to say whether a “particle is present” or not in each cell—or, in other words, it’s showing every particle but ignoring whether it’s “light” or “dark”. But in making this and the other coarse-grained pictures we’re always starting from the single “underlying microscopic evolution” that’s shown and just “adding coarse graining after the fact”. </p>\n<p>But what if we assume that all we ever know about the system is a coarse-grained version? Say we look at the “particle-or-not” case. At a coarse-grained level the initial condition just says there are 6 particles present. But it doesn’t say if each particle is light or dark, and actually there are 2<sup>6</sup> = 64 possible microscopic configurations.

Or, in other words, the number of possible states of the system consistent with a particular coarse-grained initial condition increases, corresponding to an increase in what one can consider to be the entropy of the system.</p>\n<p>There are many possible ways to set up what we might view as “coarse graining”. An example of another possibility is to focus on the values of a particular block of cells, and then to ignore the values of all other cells. But it typically doesn’t take long for the effects of other cells to “seep into” the block we’re looking at:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img122_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img122.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='160'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>So what is the bigger picture? The basic point is that insofar as the evolution of each individual microscopic state “leads to randomness”, it’ll tend to end up in a different “coarse-grained bin”. And the result is that even if one starts with a tightly defined coarse-grained description, it’ll inevitably tend to “spread out”, thereby encompassing more states and increasing the entropy.</p>\n<p>In a sense, looking at entropy and coarse graining is just a less direct way to detect that a system tends to “produce effective randomness”. And while it may have seemed like a convenient formalism when one was, for example, trying to tease things out from systems with continuous variables, it now feels like a rather indirect way to get at the core phenomenon of the Second Law. </p>\n<p>It’s useful to understand a few more connections, however. Let’s say one’s trying to work out the average value of something (say particle density) in a system. What do we mean by “average”? One possibility is that we take an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>&#8220;ensemble&#8221; of possible states</a> of the system, then find the average across these. But another possibility is that we instead look at the average across successive states in the evolution of the system. The “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-ergodicity'>ergodic hypothesis</a>” is that the ensemble average will be the same as the time average.</p>\n<p>One way this would—at least eventually—be guaranteed is if the evolution of the system is ergodic, in the sense that it eventually visits all possible states. But as we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>saw above</a>, this isn’t something that’s particularly plausible for most systems. But it also isn’t necessary. Because so long as the evolution of the system is “effectively random” enough, it’ll quickly “sample typical states”, and give essentially the same averages as one would get from sampling all possible states, but without having to laboriously visit all these states.</p>\n<p>How does one tie all this down with rigorous, mathematical-style proofs? Well, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>it&#8217;s difficult</a>. And in a first approximation <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#so-where-does-this-leave-the-second-law?'>not much progress has been made on this for more than a century</a>. But having seen that the core phenomenon of the Second Law can be reduced to an essentially purely computational statement, we’re now in a position to examine this in a different—and I think ultimately very clarifying—way.</p>\n<h2 id='why-the-second-law-works'>Why the Second Law Works</h2>\n<p>At its core the Second Law is essentially the statement that “things tend to get more random”. And in a sense the ultimate driver of this is the surprising <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>phenomenon of computational irreducibility</a> I identified in the 1980s—and the remarkable fact that even from simple initial conditions simple computational rules <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>can generate behavior of great complexity</a>. But there are definitely additional nuances to the story.</p>\n<p>For example, we’ve seen that—particularly in a reversible system—it’s always in principle possible to set up initial conditions that will evolve to “magically produce” whatever “simple” configuration we want. And when we say that we generate “apparently random” states, our “analyzer of randomness” can’t go in and invert the computational process that generated the states. Similarly, when we talk about coarse-grained entropy and its increase, we’re assuming that we’re not inventing some elaborate coarse-graining procedure that’s specially set up to pick out collections of states with “special” behavior.</p>\n<p>But there’s really just one principle that governs all these things: that whatever method we have to prepare or analyze states of a system is somehow computationally bounded. This isn’t as such a statement of physics. Rather, it’s a general <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>statement about observers</a>, or, more specifically, observers like us.</p>\n<p>We could imagine some very detailed model for an observer, or for the experimental apparatus they use. But the key point is that the details don’t matter. Really all that matters is that the observer is computationally bounded. And it’s then the basic computational mismatch between the observer and the computational irreducibility of the underlying system that leads us to “experience” the Second Law.</p>\n<p>At a theoretical level we can imagine an “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad'>alien observer</a>”—or even an observer with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>technology</a> from our own future—that would not have the same computational limitations. But the point is that insofar as we are interested in explaining our own current experience, and our own current scientific observations, what matters is the way we as observers are now, with all our computational boundedness. And it’s then the interplay between this computational boundedness, and the phenomenon of computational irreducibility, that leads to our basic experience of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>At some level the Second Law is a story of the emergence of complexity. But it’s also a story of the emergence of simplicity. For the very statement that things go to a “completely random equilibrium” implies great simplification. Yes, if an observer could look at all the details they would see great complexity. But the point is that a computationally bounded observer necessarily can’t look at those details, and instead the features they identify have a certain simplicity.</p>\n<p>And so it is, for example, that even though in a gas there are complicated underlying molecular motions, it’s still true that at an overall level a computationally bounded observer can meaningfully discuss the gas—and make predictions about its behavior—purely in terms of things like pressure and temperature that don’t probe the underlying details of molecular motions.</p>\n<p>In the past one might have thought that anything like the Second Law must somehow be specific to systems made from things like interacting particles. But in fact the core phenomenon of the Second Law is much more general, and in a sense purely computational, depending only on the basic computational phenomenon of computational irreducibility, together with the fundamental computational boundedness of observers like us.</p>\n<p>And given this generality it’s perhaps not surprising that the core phenomenon appears far beyond where anything like the Second Law has normally been considered. In particular, in our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> it now emerges as fundamental to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>structure of space itself</a>—as well as to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>phenomenon of quantum mechanics</a>. For in our Physics Project we imagine that at the lowest level everything in our universe can be represented by some essentially computational structure, conveniently described as a hypergraph whose nodes are abstract “atoms of space”. This structure evolves by following rules, whose operation will typically show all sorts of computational irreducibility. But now the question is how observers like us will perceive all this. And the point is that through our limitations we inevitably come to various “aggregate” conclusions about what’s going on. It’s very much like with the gas laws and their broad applicability to systems involving different kinds of molecules. Except that now the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-gravity'>emergent laws are about spacetime</a> and correspond to the equations of General Relativity. </p>\n<p>But the basic intellectual structure is the same. Except that in the case of spacetime, there’s an additional complication. In thermodynamics, we can imagine that there’s a system we’re studying, and the observer is outside it, “looking in”. But when we’re thinking about spacetime, the observer is necessarily embedded within it. And it turns out that there’s then one additional feature of observers like us that’s important. Beyond the statement that we’re computationally bounded, it’s also important that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>we assume that we&#8217;re persistent in time</a>. Yes, we’re made of different atoms of space at different moments. But somehow we assume that we have a coherent thread of experience. And this is crucial in deriving our familiar laws of physics.</p>\n<p>We’ll talk more about it later, but in our Physics Project the same underlying setup is also what leads to the laws of quantum mechanics. Of course, quantum mechanics is notable for the apparent randomness associated with observations made in it. And what we’ll see later is that in the end the same core phenomenon responsible for randomness in the Second Law also appears to be what’s responsible for randomness in quantum mechanics. </p>\n<p>The interplay between computational irreducibility and computational limitations of observers turns out to be a central phenomenon throughout the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> and its many emerging applications. It’s core to the fact that observers can experience computationally reducible laws in all sorts of samplings of the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a>. And in a sense all of this strengthens the story of the origins of the Second Law. Because it shows that what might have seemed like arbitrary features of observers are actually deep and general, transcending a vast range of areas and applications.</p>\n<p>But even given the robustness of features of observers, we can still ask about the origins of the whole computational phenomenon that leads to the Second Law. Ultimately it begins with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>, which asserts that systems whose behavior is not obviously simple will tend to be equivalent in their computational sophistication. The Principle of Computational Equivalence has many implications. One of them is computational irreducibility, associated with the fact that “analyzers” or “predictors” of a system cannot be expected to have any greater computational sophistication than the system itself, and so are reduced to just tracing each step in the evolution of a system to find out what it does.</p>\n<p>Another implication of the Principle of Computational Equivalence is the ubiquity of computation universality. And this is something we can expect to see “underneath” the Second Law. Because we can expect that systems like the particle cellular automaton—or, for that matter, the hard-sphere gas—will be provably capable of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p637--computation-as-a-framework/'>universal computation</a>. Already it’s easy to see that simple logic gates can be constructed from configurations of particles, but a full demonstration of computation universality will be considerably more elaborate. And while it’d be nice to have such a demonstration, there’s still more that’s needed to establish full computational irreducibility of the kind the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies.</p>\n<p>As we’ve seen, there are a variety of “indicators” of the operation of the Second Law. Some are based on looking for randomness or compression in individual states. Others are based on computing coarse grainings and entropy measures. But with the computational interpretation of the Second Law we can expect to translate such indicators into questions in areas like computational complexity theory.</p>\n<p>At some level we can think of the Second Law as being a consequence of the dynamics of a system so “encrypting” the initial conditions of a system that no computations available to an “observer” can feasibly “decrypt” it. And indeed as soon as one looks at “inverting” coarse-grained results one is immediately faced with fairly <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--np-completeness/'>classic NP problems</a> from computational complexity theory. (Establishing NP completeness in a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p767--undecidability-and-intractability/'>particular case remains challenging</a>, just like establishing computation universality.) </p>\n<h2 id='textbook-thermodynamics'>Textbook Thermodynamics</h2>\n<p>In our discussion here, we’ve treated the Second Law of thermodynamics primarily as an abstract computational phenomenon. But when thermodynamics was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-second-law-is-formulated'>historically first being developed</a>, the computational paradigm was still far in the future, and the only way to identify something like the Second Law was through its manifestations in terms of physical concepts like heat and temperature.</p>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>First Law of thermodynamics</a> asserted that heat was a form of energy, and that overall energy was conserved. The Second Law then tried to characterize the nature of the energy associated with heat. And a core idea was that this energy was somehow incoherently spread among a large number of separate microscopic components. But ultimately thermodynamics was always a story of energy.</p>\n<p>But is energy really a core feature of thermodynamics or is it merely “scaffolding” relevant for its historical development and early practical applications? In the hard-sphere gas example that we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-mystery-of-the-second-law' >started from above</a>, there’s a pretty clear notion of energy. But quite soon we largely abstracted energy away. Though in our particle cellular automaton we do still have something somewhat analogous to energy conservation: we have <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-4--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena'>conservation of the number of non-white cells</a>. </p>\n<p>In a traditional physical system like a gas, temperature gives the average energy per degree of freedom. But in something like our particle cellular automaton, we’re effectively assuming that all particles always have the same energy—so there is for example no way to “change the temperature”. Or, put another way, what we might consider as the energy of the system is basically just given by the number of particles in the system.</p>\n<p>Does this simplification affect the core phenomenon of the Second Law? No. That’s something much stronger, and quite independent of these details. But in the effort to make contact with recognizable “textbook thermodynamics”, it’s useful to consider how we’d add in ideas like heat and temperature.</p>\n<p>In our discussion of the Second Law, we’ve identified entropy with the log of the number states consistent with a constraint. But more traditional thermodynamics involves formulas like <nobr><em>dS</em> = <em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em></nobr>. And it’s not hard to see at least roughly where this formula comes from. <em>Q</em> gives total heat content, or “total heat energy” (not worrying about what this is measured relative to, which is what makes it <em>dQ</em> rather than <em>Q</em>). <em>T</em> gives average energy per “degree of freedom” (or, roughly, particle). And this means that <em>Q</em>/<em>T</em> effectively measures something like the “number of particles”. But at least in a system like a particle cellular automaton, the number of possible complete configurations is exponential in the number of particles, making its logarithm, the entropy <em>S</em>, roughly proportional to the number of particles, and thus to <em>Q</em>/<em>T</em>. That anything like this argument works depends, though, on being able to discuss things “statistically”, which in turn depends on the core phenomenon of the Second Law: the tendency of things to evolve to uniform (“equilibrium”) randomness.</p>\n<p>When the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>Second Law was first introduced</a>, there were several formulations given, all initially referencing energy. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-second-law-is-formulated'>One formulation stated</a> that &#8220;heat does not spontaneously go from a colder body to a hotter”. And even in our particle cellular automaton we can see a fairly direct version of this. Our proxy for &#8220;temperature&#8221; is density of particles. And what we observe is that an initial region of higher density <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p464--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena/'>tends to &#8220;diffuse&#8221; out</a>:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img125_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img125.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='220'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Another formulation of the Second Law talks about the impossibility of systematically “turning heat into mechanical work”. At a computational level, the analog of “mechanical work” is systematic, predictable behavior. So what this is saying is again that systems tend to generate randomness, and to “remove predictability”. </p>\n<p>In a sense this is a direct reflection of computational irreducibility. To get something that one can “harness as mechanical work” one needs something that one can readily predict. But the whole point is that the presence of computational irreducibility makes prediction take an irreducible amount of computational work—that is beyond the capabilities of an “observer like us”.</p>\n<p>Closely related is the statement that it’s not possible to make a perpetual motion machine (“of the second kind”, i.e. violating the Second Law), that continually “makes systematic motion” from “heat”. In our computational setting this would be like extracting a systematic, predictable sequence of bits from our particle cellular automaton, or from something like rule 30. And, yes, if we had a device that could for example <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes/'>systematically predict rule 30</a>, then it would be straightforward, say, “just to pick out black cells”, and effectively to derive a predictable sequence. But computational irreducibility implies that we won’t be able to do this, without effectively just directly reproducing what rule 30 does, which an “observer like us” doesn’t have the computational capability to do.</p>\n<p>Much of the textbook discussion of thermodynamics is centered around the assumption of “equilibrium”—or something infinitesimally close to it—in which one assumes that a system behaves “uniformly and randomly”. Indeed, the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics is essentially the statement that “statistically unique” equilibrium can be achieved, which in terms of energy becomes a statement that there is a unique notion of temperature.</p>\n<p>Once one has the idea of “equilibrium”, one can then start to think of its properties as purely being functions of certain parameters—and this opens up all sorts of calculus-based mathematical opportunities. That anything like this makes sense depends, however, yet again on “perfect randomness as far as the observer is concerned”. Because if the observer could notice a difference between different configurations, it wouldn’t be possible to treat all of them as just being “in the equilibrium state”. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, while the intuition of all this is made rather clear by our computational view, there are details to be filled in when it comes to any particular mathematical formulation of features of thermodynamics. As one example, let’s consider a core result of traditional thermodynamics: the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>Maxwell–Boltzmann exponential distribution of energies</a> for individual particles or other degrees of freedom.</p>\n<p>To set up a discussion of this, we need to have a system where there can be many possible microscopic amounts of energy, say, associated with some kind of idealized particles. Then we imagine that in “collisions” between such particles energy is exchanged, but the total is always conserved. And the question is how energy will eventually be distributed among the particles. </p>\n<p>As a first example, let’s imagine that we have a collection of particles which evolve in a series of steps, and that at each step particles are paired up at random to “collide”. And, further, let’s assume that the effect of the collision is to randomly redistribute energy between the particles, say with a uniform distribution. </p>\n<p>We can represent this process using a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graph</a>, where the events (indicated here in yellow) are the collisions, and the tokens (indicated here in red) represent states of particles at each step.

Such books also tend to talk about things like tradeoffs between energy and entropy, and define things like the (Helmholtz) free energy <em>F</em> = <em>U</em> – <em>T</em> <em>S</em> (where <em>U</em> is internal energy, <em>T</em> is temperature and <em>S</em> is entropy) that are used in answering questions like whether particular chemical reactions will occur under certain conditions. </p>\n<p>But given our discussion of energy here, and our earlier discussion of entropy, it&#8217;s at first quite unclear how these quantities might relate, and how they can trade off against each other, say in the formula for free energy. But in some sense what connects energy to the standard definition of entropy in terms of the logarithm of the number of states is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, with its exponential form. In the usual physical setup, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is basically <em>e</em><sup>(–<em>E</em>/<em>kT</em>)</sup>, where <em>T</em> is the temperature, and <em>kT</em> is the average energy. </p>\n<p>But now imagine we’re trying to figure out whether some process—say a chemical reaction—will happen. If there’s an energy barrier, say associated with an energy difference Δ, then according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution there’ll be a probability proportional to <em>e</em><sup>(–Δ/<em>kT</em>)</sup> for molecules to have a high enough energy to surmount that barrier. But the next question is how many configurations of molecules there are in which molecules will “try to surmount the barrier”. And that’s where the entropy comes in. Because if the number of possible configurations is Ω, the entropy <em>S</em> is given by <em>k</em> log Ω, so that in terms of <em>S</em>, Ω = <em>e</em><sup>(<em>S</em>/<em>k</em>)</sup>. But now the “average number of molecules which will surmount the barrier” is roughly given by <nobr><em>e</em><sup>(<em>S</em>/<em>k</em>)</sup> <em>e</em><sup>(–Δ/<em>kT</em>)</sup>,</nobr> so that in the end the exponent is proportional to Δ – <em>T S</em>, which has the form of the free energy <em>U</em> – <em>T</em> <em>S</em>.</p>\n<p>This argument is quite rough, but it captures the essence of what’s going on. And at first it might seem like a remarkable coincidence that there’s a logarithm in the definition of entropy that just “conveniently fits together” like this with the exponential in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. But it’s actually not a coincidence at all. The point is that what’s really fundamental is the concept of counting the number of possible states of a system. But typically this number is extremely large. And we need some way to “tame” it. We could in principle use some slow-growing function other than log to do this. But if we use log (as in the standard definition of entropy) we precisely get the tradeoff with energy in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.</p>\n<p>There is also another convenient feature of using log. If two systems are independent, one with Ω<sub>1</sub> states, and the other with Ω<sub>2</sub> states, then a system that combines these (without interaction) will have Ω<sub>1</sub>, Ω<sub>2</sub> states. And if <em>S</em> = <em>k</em> log Ω, then this means that the entropy of the combined state will just be the sum <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> of the entropies of the individual states. But is this fact actually “fundamentally independent” of the exponential character of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution? Well, no. Or at least it comes from the same mathematical idea. Because it’s the fact that in equilibrium the probability &fnof;(<em>E</em>) is supposed to satisfy &fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>1</sub>)&fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>2</sub>) = &fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>3</sub>)&fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>4</sub>) when <em>E</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>E</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>E</em><sub>3</sub> + <em>E</em><sub>4</sub> that makes &fnof;(<em>E</em>) have its exponential form. In other words, both stories are about exponentials being able to connect additive combination of one quantity with multiplicative combination of another.</p>\n<p>Having said all this, though, it’s important to understand that you don’t need energy to talk about entropy. The concept of entropy, as we’ve discussed, is ultimately a computational concept, quite independent of physical notions like energy. In many textbook treatments of thermodynamics, energy and entropy are in some sense put on a similar footing. The First Law is about energy. The Second Law is about entropy. But what we’ve seen here is that energy is really a concept at a different level from entropy: it’s something one gets to “layer on” in discussing physical systems, but it’s not a necessary part of the “computational essence” of how things work.</p>\n<p>(As an extra wrinkle, in the case of our Physics Project—as to some extent in traditional general relativity and quantum mechanics—there are some fundamental connections between energy and entropy. In particular—related to what we’ll discuss below—the number of possible discrete configurations of spacetime is inevitably related to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>&#8220;density&#8221; of events, which defines energy</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id='towards-a-formal-proof-of-the-second-law'>Towards a Formal Proof of the Second Law</h2>\n<p>It would be nice to be able to say, for example, that “using computation theory, we can prove the Second Law”. But it isn’t as simple as that. Not least because, as we’ve seen, the validity of the Second Law depends on things like what “observers like us” are capable of. But we can, for example, formulate what the outline of a proof of the Second Law could be like, though to give a full formal proof we’d have to introduce a variety of “axioms” (<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>essentially about observers</a>) that don’t have immediate foundations in existing areas of mathematics, physics or computation theory.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that one imagines a state <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span> of a system (which could just be a sequence of values for cells in something like a cellular automaton). One considers an “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-2--what-perception-and-analysis-do'>observer function</a>” Θ which, when applied to the state <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>, gives a “summary” of <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>. (A very simple example would be the run-length encoding that we used above.) Now we imagine some “evolution function” Ξ that is applied to <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>. The basic claim of the Second Law is that the “sizes” normally satisfy the inequality Θ[Ξ[<span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>]] ≥ Θ[<span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>], or in other words, that “compression by the observer” is less effective after the evolution of system, in effect because the state of the system has “become more random”, as our informal statement of the Second Law suggests.</p>\n<p>What are the possible forms of Θ and Ξ? It’s slightly easier to talk about Ξ, because we imagine that this is basically any not-obviously-trivial computation, run for an increasing number of steps. It could be repeated application of a cellular automaton rule, or a Turing machine, or any other computational system. We might represent an individual step by an operator <em>ξ</em>, and say that in effect Ξ = <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>. We can always construct <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup> by explicitly applying <em>ξ</em> successively <em>t</em> times. But the question of computational irreducibility is whether there’s a shortcut way to get to the same result. And given any specific representation of <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup> (say, rather prosaically, as a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--lower-bounds-on-computational-complexity/'>Boolean circuit</a>), we can ask how the size of that representation grows with <em>t</em>.</p>\n<p>With the current state of computation theory, it’s exceptionally difficult to get definitive general results about minimal sizes of <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>, though in sufficiently small cases it’s possible to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p761--undecidability-and-intractability/'>determine this &#8220;experimentally&#8221;</a>, essentially by exhaustive search. But there’s an increasing amount of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes/'>at least circumstantial evidence</a> that for many kinds of systems, one can’t do much better than explicitly constructing <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>, as the phenomenon of computational irreducibility suggests. (One can imagine “toy models”, in which <em>ξ</em> corresponds to some very simple computational process—like a finite automaton—but while this likely allows one to prove things, it’s not at all clear how useful or representative any of the results will be.)</p>\n<p>OK, so what about the “observer function” Θ? For this we need some kind of “observer theory”, that characterizes what observers—or, at least “observers like us”—can do, in the same kind of way that standard computation theory characterizes what computational systems can do. There are clearly some features Θ must have. For example, it can’t involve unbounded amounts of computation. But realistically there’s more than that. Somehow the role of observers is to take all the details that might exist in the “outside world”, and reduce or compress these to some “smaller” representation that can “fit in the mind of the observer”, and allow the observer to “make decisions” that abstract from the details of the outside world whatever specifics the observer “cares about”. And—like a construction such as a Turing machine—one must in the end have some way of building up “possible observers” from something like basic primitives.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, even given primitives—or an axiomatic foundation—for Ξ and Θ, things are not straightforward. For example, it’s basically inevitable that many specific questions one might ask will turn out to be formally undecidable. And we can’t expect (particularly as we’ll see later) that we’ll be able to show that the Second Law is “just true”. It’ll be a statement that necessarily involves qualifiers like “typically”. And if we ask to characterize “typically” in terms, say, of “probabilities”, we’ll be stuck in a kind of recursive situation of having to define probability measures in terms of the very same constructs we’re starting from.</p>\n<p>But despite these difficulties in making what one might characterize as general abstract statements, what our computational formulation achieves is to provide a clear intuitive guide to the origin of the Second Law. And from this we can in particular construct an infinite range of specific computational experiments that illustrate the core phenomenon of the Second Law, and give us more and more understanding of how the Second Law works, and where it conceptually comes from.</p>\n<h2 id='maxwell&rsquo;s-demon-and-the-character-of-observers'>Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon and the Character of Observers</h2>\n<p>Even in the very early years of the formulation of the Second Law, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=james+clerk+maxwell'>James Clerk Maxwell</a> already <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#maxwell%E2%80%99s-demon'>brought up an objection to its general applicability</a>, and to the idea that systems “always become more random”.

Maxwell suggested that such a demon should readily be able to “sort” molecules, thereby reversing any “randomness” that might be developing.</p>\n<p>As a very simple example, imagine that at the center of our particle cellular automaton we insert a barrier that lets particles pass from left to right but not the reverse.

Meanwhile, all kinds of objections to their successful operation have been raised. “The demon can’t be made small enough”; “The demon will heat up and stop working”; “The demon will need to reset its memory, so has to be fundamentally irreversible”; “The demon will inevitably randomize things when it tries to sense molecules”; etc. </p>\n<p>So what’s true? It depends on what we assume about the demon—and in particular to what extent we suppose that the demon needs to be following the same underlying laws as the system it’s operating on. As a somewhat extreme example, let’s imagine trying to “make a demon out of gas molecules”. Here’s an attempt at a simple model of this in our particle cellular automaton: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img174_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img174.png\" alt='' title='' width='575' height='203'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>For a while we successfully maintain a “barrier”. But eventually the barrier succumbs to the same “degradation” processes as everything else, and melts away. Can we do better? </p>\n<p>Let’s imagine that “inside the barrier” (AKA “demon”) there’s “machinery” that whenever the barrier is “buffeted” in a given way “puts up the right kind of armor” to “protect it” from that kind of buffeting. Assuming our underlying system is for example computation universal, we should at some level be able to “implement any computation we want”. (What needs to be done is quite analogous to cellular automata that successfully <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/#cellular-automata-with-noise'>erase up to finite levels of &#8220;noise&#8221;</a>.) </p>\n<p>But there’s a problem. In order to “protect the barrier” we have to be able to “predict” how it will be “attacked”. Or, in other words, our barrier (or demon) will have to be able to systematically determine what the outside system is going to do before it does it. But if the behavior of the outside system is computationally irreducible this won’t in general be possible. So in the end the criterion for a demon like this to be impossible is essentially the same as the criterion for Second Law behavior to occur in the first place: that the system we’re looking at is computationally irreducible.</p>\n<p>There’s a bit more to say about this, though. We’ve been talking about a demon that’s trying to “achieve something fairly simple”, like maintaining a barrier or a “one-way membrane”. But what if we’re more flexible in what we consider the objective of the demon to be? And even if the demon can’t achieve our original “simple objective” might there at least be some kind of “useful sorting” that it can do?</p>\n<p>Well, that depends on what we imagine constitutes “useful sorting”. The system is always following its rules to do something. But probably it’s not something we consider “useful sorting”. But what would count as “useful sorting”? Presumably it’s got to be something that an observer will “notice”, and more than that, it should be something that has “done some of the job of decision making” ahead of the observer. In principle a sufficiently powerful observer might be able to “look inside the gas” and see what the results of some elaborate sorting procedure would be. But the point is for the demon to just make the sorting happen, so the job of the observer becomes essentially trivial.</p>\n<p>But all of this then comes back to the question of what kind of thing an observer might want to observe. In general one would like to be able to characterize this by having an “observer theory” that provides a metatheory of possible observers in something like the kind of way that computation theory and ideas like Turing machines provide a metatheory of possible computational systems.</p>\n<p>So what really is an observer, or at least an observer like us? The most crucial feature seems to be that the observer is always ultimately some kind of “finite mind” that takes all the complexity of the world and extracts from it just certain “summary features” that are relevant to the “decisions” it has to make. (Another crucial feature seems to be that the observer can consistently view themselves as being “persistent”.) But we don’t have to go all the way to a sophisticated “mind” to see this picture in operation. Because it’s already what’s going on not only in something like perception but also in essentially anything we’d usually call “measurement”.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine we have a gas containing lots of molecules. A standard measurement might be to find the pressure of the gas. And in doing such a measurement, what’s happening is that we’re reducing the information about all the detailed motions of individual molecules, and just summarizing it by a single aggregate number that is the pressure. </p>\n<p>How do we achieve this? We might have a piston connected to the box of gas. And each time a molecule hits the piston it’ll push it a little. But the point is that in the end the piston moves only as a whole. And the effects of all the individual molecules are aggregated into that overall motion. </p>\n<p>At a microscopic level, any actual physical piston is presumably also made out of molecules. But unlike the molecules in the gas, these molecules are tightly bound together to make the piston solid. Every time a gas molecule hits the surface of the piston, it’ll transfer some momentum to a molecule in the piston, and there’ll be some kind of tiny deformation wave that goes through the piston. To get a “definitive pressure measurement”—based on definitive motion of the piston as a whole—that deformation wave will somehow have to disappear. And in making a theory of the “piston as observer” we’ll typically ignore the physical details, and idealize things by saying that the piston moves only as a whole.</p>\n<p>But ultimately if we were to just look at the system “dispassionately”, without knowing the “intent” of the piston, we’d just see a bunch of molecules in the gas, and a bunch of molecules in the piston. So how would we tell that the piston is “acting as an observer”? In some ways it’s a rather circular story. If we assume that there’s a particular kind of thing an observer wants to measure, then we can potentially identify parts of a system that “achieve that measurement”. But in the abstract we don’t know what an observer “wants to measure”. We’ll always see one part of a system affecting another. But is it “achieving measurement” or not?</p>\n<p>To resolve this, we have to have some kind of metatheory of the observer: we have to be able to say what kinds of things we’re going to count as observers and what not. And ultimately that’s something that must inevitably devolve to a rather human question. Because in the end what we care about is what we humans sense about the world, which is what, for example, we try to construct science about. </p>\n<p>We could talk very specifically about the sensory apparatus that we humans have—or that we’ve built with technology. But the essence of observer theory should presumably be some kind of generalization of that. Something that recognizes fundamental features—like computational boundedness—of us as entities, but that does not depend on the fact that we happen to use sight rather than smell as our most important sense.</p>\n<p>The situation is a bit like the early development of computation theory. Something like a Turing machine was intended to define a mechanism that roughly mirrored the computational capabilities of the human mind, but that also provided a “reasonable generalization” that covered, for example, machines one could imagine building. Of course, in that particular case the definition that was developed proved extremely useful, being, it seems, of just the right generality to cover computations that can occur in our universe—but not beyond. </p>\n<p>And one might hope that in the future observer theory would identify a similarly useful definition for what a “reasonable observer” can be. And given such a definition, we will, for example, be in position to further tighten up our characterization of what the Second Law might say.</p>\n<p>It may be worth commenting that in thinking about an observer as being an “entity like us” one of the immediate attributes we might seek is that the observer should have some kind of “inner experience”. But if we’re just looking at the pattern of molecules in a system, how do we tell where there’s an “inner experience” happening? From the outside, we presumably ultimately can’t. And it’s really only possible when we’re “on the inside”. We might have scientific criteria that tell us whether something can reasonably support an inner experience. But to know if there actually is an inner experience “going on” we basically have to be experiencing it. We can’t make a “first-principles” objective theory; we just have to posit that such-and-such part of the system is representing our subjective experience.</p>\n<p>Of course, that doesn’t mean that there can’t still be very general conclusions to be drawn. Because it can still be—as it is in our Physics Project and in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>thinking about the ruliad</a>—that it takes knowing only rather basic features of “observers like us” to be able to make very general statements about things like the effective laws we will experience.</p>\n<h2 id='the-heat-death-of-the-universe'>The Heat Death of the Universe</h2>\n<p>It <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-second-law-is-formulated'>didn&#8217;t take long after the Second Law was first proposed</a> for people to start talking about its implications for the long-term evolution of the universe. If “randomness” (for example as characterized by entropy) always increases, doesn’t that mean that the universe must eventually evolve to a state of “equilibrium randomness”, in which all the rich structures we now see have decayed into “random heat”?</p>\n<p>There are several issues here. But the most obvious has to do with what observer one imagines will be experiencing that future state of the universe. After all, if the underlying rules which govern the universe are reversible, then in principle it will always be possible to go back from that future “random heat” and reconstruct from it all the rich structures that have existed in the history of the universe.</p>\n<p>But the point of the Second Law as we’ve discussed it is that at least for computationally bounded observers like us that won’t be possible. The past will always in principle be determinable from the future, but it will take irreducibly much computation to do so—and vastly more than observers like us can muster.</p>\n<p>And along the same lines, if observers like us examine the future state of the universe we won’t be able to see that there’s anything special about it. Even though it came from the “special state” that is the current state of our universe, we won’t be able to tell it from a “typical” state, and we’ll just consider it “random”.</p>\n<p>But what if the observers evolve with the evolution of the universe? Yes, to us today that future configuration of particles may just “look random”. But in actuality, it has rich computational content that there’s no reason to assume a future observer will not find in some way or another significant. Indeed, in a sense the longer the universe has been around, the larger the amount of irreducible computation it will have done. And, yes, observers like us today might not care about most of what comes out of that computation. But in principle there are features of it that could be mined to inform the “experience” of future observers.</p>\n<p>At a practical level, our basic human senses pick out certain features on certain scales. But as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>technology progresses</a>, it gives us ways to pick out much more, on much finer scales. A century ago we couldn’t realistically pick out individual atoms or individual photons; now we routinely can. And what seemed like “random noise” just a few decades ago is now often known to have specific, detailed structure. </p>\n<p>There is, however, a complex tradeoff. A crucial feature of observers like us is that there is a certain coherence to our experience; we sample little enough about the world that we’re able to turn it into a coherent thread of experience. But the more an observer samples, the more difficult this will become. So, yes, a future observer with vastly more advanced technology might successfully be able to sample lots of details of the future universe. But to do that, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>the observer will have to lose some of their own coherence</a>, and ultimately we won’t even be able to identify that future observer as “coherently existing” at all.</p>\n<p>The usual “heat death of the universe” refers to the fate of matter and other particles in the universe. But what about things like gravity and the structure of spacetime? In traditional physics, that’s been a fairly separate question. But in our Physics Project everything is ultimately described in terms of a single abstract structure that represents both space and everything in it. And we can expect that the evolution of this whole structure then corresponds to a computationally irreducible process.</p>\n<p>The basic setup is at its core just like what we’ve seen in our general discussion of the Second Law. But here we’re operating at the lowest level of the universe, so the irreducible progression of computation can be thought of as representing the fundamental inexorable passage of time. As time moves forward, therefore, we can generally expect “more randomness” in the lowest-level structure of the universe.</p>\n<p>But what will observers perceive? There’s considerable trickiness here—particularly in connection with quantum mechanics—that we’ll discuss later. In essence, the point is that there are many paths of history for the universe, that branch and merge—and observers sample certain collections of paths. And for example on some paths the computations may simply halt, with no further rules applying—so that in effect “time stops”, at least for observers on those paths. It’s a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>phenomenon that can be identified with spacetime singularities</a>, and with what happens inside (at least certain) black holes.</p>\n<p>So does this mean that the universe might “just stop”, in effect ending with a collection of black holes? It’s more complicated than that. Because there are always other paths for observers to follow. Some correspond to different quantum possibilities. But ultimately what we imagine is that our perception of the universe is a sampling from the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad—the limiting entangled structure formed by running all abstractly possible computations forever</a>. And it’s a feature of the construction of the ruliad that it’s infinite. Individual paths in it can halt, but the whole ruliad goes on forever. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean about the ultimate fate of the universe? Much like the situation with heat death, specific observers may conclude that “nothing interesting is happening anymore”. But something always will be happening, and in fact that something will represent the accumulation of larger and larger amounts of irreducible computation. It won’t be possible for an observer to encompass all this while still themselves “remaining coherent”. But as we’ll discuss later there will inexorably be pockets of computational reducibility for which coherent observers can exist, although what those observers will perceive is likely to be utterly incoherent with anything that we as observers now perceive. </p>\n<p>The universe does not fundamentally just “descend into randomness”. And indeed all the things that exist in our universe today will ultimately be encoded in some way forever in the detailed structure that develops. But what the core phenomenon of the Second Law suggests is that at least many aspects of that encoding will not be accessible to observers like us. The future of the universe will transcend what we so far “appreciate”, and will require a redefinition of what we consider meaningful. But it should not be “taken for dead” or dismissed as being just “random heat”. It’s just that to find what we consider interesting, we may in effect have to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#reaching-out-across-rulial-space'>migrate across the ruliad</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='traces-of-initial-conditions'>Traces of Initial Conditions</h2>\n<p>The Second Law gives us the expectation that so long as we start from “reasonable” initial conditions, we should always evolve to some kind of “uniformly random” configuration that we can view as a “unique equilibrium state” that’s “lost any meaningful memory” of the initial conditions. But now that we’ve got ways to explore the Second Law in specific, simple computational systems, we can explicitly study the extent to which this expectation is upheld. And what we’ll find is that even though as a general matter it is, there can still be exceptions in which traces of initial conditions can be preserved at least long into the evolution. </p>\n<p>Let’s look again at our “particle cellular automaton” system. We saw above that the evolution of an initial “blob” (here of size 17 in a system with 30 cells) leads to configurations that typically look quite random:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img175_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img175.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='272'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>But what about other initial conditions?

Essentially the point is that even though something like our particle cellular automaton exhibits computational irreducibility and often generates “featureless” apparent randomness, a system like this is also capable of exhibiting computational reducibility in which traces of the initial conditions can persist, and there isn’t just “generic randomness generation”.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility is a powerful force. But, as we’ll discuss below, its very presence implies that there must inevitably also be “pockets” of computational reducibility. And once again (as we’ll discuss below) it’s a question of the observer how obvious or not these pockets may be in a particular case, and whether—say for observers like us—they affect what we perceive in terms of the operation of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>It’s worth commenting that such issues are not just a feature of systems like our particle cellular automaton. And indeed they’ve appeared—stretching all the way back to the 1950s—pretty much whenever <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>detailed simulations have been done</a> of systems that one might expect would show “Second Law” behavior. The story is typically that, yes, there is apparent randomness generated (though it’s often barely studied as such), just as the Second Law would suggest. But then there’s a big surprise of some kind of unexpected regularity. In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--history-of-thermodynamics/'>arrays of nonlinear springs</a>, there were solitons. In <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>hard-sphere gases</a>, there were “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-999d/'>long-time tails</a>”—in which correlations in the motion of spheres were seen to decay not exponentially in time, but rather like power laws. </p>\n<p>The phenomenon of long-time tails is actually visible in the cellular automaton “approximation” to hard-sphere gases that we studied above. And its interpretation is a good example of how computational reducibility manifests itself. At a small scale, the motion of our idealized molecules shows computational irreducibility and randomness. But on a larger scale, it’s more like “collective hydrodynamics”, with fluid mechanics effects like vortices. And it’s these much-simpler-to-describe computationally reducible effects that lead to the “unexpected regularities” associated with long-time tails. </p>\n<h2 id='when-the-second-law-works,-and-when-it-doesn&rsquo;t'>When the Second Law Works, and When It Doesn&rsquo;t</h2>\n<p>At its core, the Second Law is about evolution from orderly “simple” initial conditions to apparent randomness. And, yes, this is a phenomenon we can certainly see happen in things like hard-sphere gases in which we’re in effect emulating the motion of physical gas molecules.

Well, in these cases the Second Law doesn’t apply.</p>\n<p>In standard physics, the Second Law is often applied to gases—and indeed this was its very first application area.

But it’s simply not true. The validity of the Second Law is associated with the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. And, yes, this phenomenon is quite ubiquitous. But there are definitely systems and situations in which it does not occur. And those will not show “Second Law” behavior. </p>\n<p>There are plenty of complicated “marginal” cases, however.

Another involves the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>identification of particles</a> that can be considered to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>&#8220;move without change&#8221; through the system</a>.</p>\n<p>One might have thought—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#what-the-textbooks-said:-the-evolution-of-certainty'>as people often have</a>—that the Second Law would imply a degradation of every feature of a system to uniform randomness. But that’s just not how computational irreducibility works. Because whenever there’s computational irreducibility, there are also inevitably an infinite number of pockets of computational reducibility. (If there weren’t, that very fact could be used to “reduce the irreducibility”.) </p>\n<p>And what that means is that when there’s irreducibility and Second-Law-like randomization, there’ll also always be orderly laws to be found. But which of those laws will be evident—or relevant—to a particular observer depends on the nature of that observer. </p>\n<p>The Second Law is ultimately a story of the mismatch between the computational irreducibility of underlying systems, and the computational boundedness of observers like us. But the point is that if there’s a pocket of computational reducibility that happens to be “a fit” for us as observers, then despite our computational limitations, we’ll be perfectly able to recognize the orderliness that’s associated with it—and we won’t think that the system we’re looking at has just “degraded to randomness”.</p>\n<p>So what this means is that there’s ultimately no conflict between the existence of order in the universe, and the operation of the Second Law. Yes, there’s an “ocean of randomness” generated by computational irreducibility. But there’s also inevitably order that lives in pockets of reducibility. And the question is just whether a particular observer “notices” a given pocket of reducibility, or whether they only “see” the “background” of computational irreducibility. </p>\n<p>In the “hydrodynamics” example above, the “observer” picks out a “slice” of behavior by looking at aggregated local averages. But another way for an observer to pick out a “slice” of behavior is just to look only at a specific region in a system. And in that case one can observe simpler behavior because in effect “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p456--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>the complexity has radiated away</a>”.

Class 2, however, works a bit like solid matter, essentially just maintaining whatever configuration it was started in. Class 3 works more like a gas or a liquid, continually “mixing things up” in a way that looks quite random. But class 4 does something more complicated.</p>\n<p>In class 3 there aren’t significant identifiable persistent structures, and everything always seems to quickly get randomized. But the distinguishing feature of class 4 is the presence of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-8--structures-in-class-4-systems'>identifiable persistent structures</a>, whose interactions effectively define the activity of the system. </p>\n<p>So how do these types of behavior relate to the Second Law? Class 1 involves intrinsic irreversibility, and so doesn’t immediately connect to standard Second Law behavior. Class 2 is basically too static to follow the Second Law. But class 3 shows quintessential Second Law behavior, with rapid evolution to “typical random states”. And it’s class 3 that captures the kind of behavior that’s seen in typical Second Law systems, like gases.</p>\n<p>But what about class 4? Well, it’s a more complicated story. The “level of activity” in class 4—while above class 2—is in a sense below class 3. But unlike in class 3, where there is typically “too much activity” to “see what’s going on”, class 4 often gives one the idea that it’s operating in a “more potentially understandable” way. There are many different detailed kinds of behavior that appear in class 4 systems.

Class 1 and 2 systems basically behave in computationally simple ways. But as soon as we reach class 3 we’re dealing with computational irreducibility, and with a “density of computation” that lets us decode almost nothing about what comes out, with the result that what we see we can basically describe only as “apparently random”. Class 4 no doubt has the same ultimate computational irreducibility—and the same ultimate computational capabilities—as class 3. But now the computation is “less dense”, and seemingly more accessible to human interpretation. In class 3 it’s difficult to imagine making any kind of “symbolic summary” of what’s going on. But in class 4, we see <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-8--structures-in-class-4-systems'>definite structures</a> whose behavior we can imagine being able to describe in a symbolic way, building up what we can think of as a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-nature-of-explainability'>&#8220;human-accessible narrative&#8221;</a> in which we talk about “structure X collides with structure Y to produce structure Z” and so on.</p>\n<p>And indeed if we look at the picture above, it’s not too difficult to imagine that it might correspond to the execution trace of a computation we might do. And more than that, given the “identifiable components” that arise in class 4 systems, one can imagine assembling these to explicitly set up particular computations one wants to do. In a class 3 system “randomness” always just “spurts out”, and one has very little ability to “meaningfully control” what happens. But in a class 4 system, one can potentially do what amounts to traditional engineering or programming to set up an arrangement of identifiable component “primitives” that achieves some particular purpose one has chosen.</p>\n<p>And indeed in a case like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-11--the-notion-of-computation#sect-11-8--the-rule-110-cellular-automaton'>rule 110 cellular automaton</a> we know that it’s possible to perform any computation in this way, proving that the system is capable of universal computation, and providing a piece of evidence for the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. No doubt <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>rule 30 is also computation universal</a>. But the point is that with our current ways of analyzing things, class 3 systems like this don’t make this something we can readily recognize.</p>\n<p>Like so many other things we’re discussing, this is basically again a story of observers and their capabilities. If observers like us—with our computational boundedness—are going to be able to “get things into our minds” we seem to need to break them down to the point where they can be described in terms of modest numbers of types of somewhat-independent parts. And that’s what the “decomposition into identifiable structures” that we observe in class 4 systems gives us the opportunity to do.</p>\n<p>What about class 3? Notwithstanding things like our discussion of traces of initial conditions above, our current powers of perception just don’t seem to let us “understand what’s going on” to the point where we can say much more than there’s apparent randomness. And of course it’s this very point that we’re arguing is the basis for the Second Law. Could there be observers who could “decode class 3 systems”? In principle, absolutely yes. And even if the observers—like us—are computationally bounded, we can expect that there will be at least some pockets of computational reducibility that could be found that would allow progress to be made.</p>\n<p>But as of now—with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>methods of perception and analysis</a> currently at our disposal—there’s something very different for us about class 3 and class 4. Class 3 shows quintessential “apparently random” behavior, like molecules in a gas. Class 4 shows behavior that looks more like the “insides of a machine” that could have been “intentionally engineered for a purpose”. Having a system that is like this “in bulk” is not something familiar, say from physics. There are solids, and liquids, and gases, whose components have different general organizational characteristics. But what we see in class 4 is something yet different—and quite unfamiliar.</p>\n<p>Like solids, liquids and gases, it’s something that can exist “in bulk”, with any number of components. We can think of it as a “phase” of a system. But it’s a new type of phase, that we might call a “mechanoidal phase”.</p>\n<p>How do we recognize this phase? Again, it’s a question of the observer. Something like a solid phase is easy for observers like us to recognize. But even the distinction between a liquid and a gas can be more difficult to recognize. And to recognize the mechanoidal phase we basically have to be asking something like “Is this a computation we recognize?”</p>\n<p>How does all this relate to the Second Law? Class 3 systems—like gases—immediately show typical “Second Law” behavior, characterized by randomness, entropy increase, equilibrium, and so on. But class 4 systems work differently. They have new characteristics that don’t fit neatly into the rubric of the Second Law. </p>\n<p>No doubt one day we will have theories of the mechanoidal phase just like today we have theories of gases, of liquids and of solids. Likely those theories will have to get more sophisticated in characterizing the observer, and in describing what kinds of coarse graining can reasonably be done. Presumably there will be some kind of analog of the Second Law that leverages the difference between the capabilities and features of the observer and the system they’re observing. But in the mechanoidal phase there is in a sense less distance between the mechanism of the system and the mechanism of the observer, so we probably can’t expect a statement as ultimately simple and clear-cut as the usual Second Law. </p>\n<h2 id='the-mechanoidal-phase-and-bulk-molecular-biology'>The Mechanoidal Phase and Bulk Molecular Biology</h2>\n<p>The Second Law has long had an <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--defining-life/'>uneasy relationship with biology</a>. “Physical” systems like gases readily show the “decay” to randomness expected from the Second Law. But living systems instead somehow seem to maintain all sorts of elaborate organization that doesn’t immediately “decay to randomness”— and indeed actually seems able to grow just through “processes of biology”.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to point to the continual absorption of energy and material by living systems—as well as their eventual death and decay—as reasons why such systems might still at least nominally follow the Second Law. But even if at some level this works, it’s not particularly useful in letting us talk about the actual significant “bulk” features of living systems—in the kind of way that the Second Law routinely lets us make “bulk” statements about things like gases.</p>\n<p>So how might we begin to describe living systems “in bulk”? I suspect a key is to think of them as being in large part in what we’re here calling the mechanoidal phase. If one looks inside a living organism at a molecular scale, there are some parts that can reasonably be described as solid, liquid or gas. But what molecular biology has increasingly shown is that there&#8217;s often much more elaborate molecular-scale organization than exist in those phases—and moreover that at least at some level this organization seems “describable” and “machine-like”, with molecules and collections of molecules that we can say have &#8220;particular functions&#8221;, often being &#8220;carefully&#8221; and actively transported by things like the cytoskeleton.</p>\n<p>In any given organism, there are for example specific proteins defined by the genomics of the organism, that behave in specific ways. But one suspects that there&#8217;s also a higher-level or &#8220;bulk&#8221; description that allows one to make at least some kinds of general statements. There are already some known general principles in biology—like the concept of natural selection, or the self-replicating digital character of genetic information—that let one come to various conclusions independent of microscopic details.</p>\n<p>And, yes, in some situations the Second Law provides certain kinds of statements about biology. But I suspect that there are much more powerful and significant principles to be discovered, that in fact have the potential to unlock a whole new level of global understanding of biological systems and processes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s perhaps worth mentioning an analogy in technology. In a microprocessor what we can think of as the &#8220;working fluid&#8221; is essentially a gas of electrons. At some level the Second Law has things to say about this gas of electrons, for example describing scattering processes that lead to electrical resistance. But the vast majority of what matters in the behavior of this particular gas of electrons is defined not by things like this, but by the elaborate pattern of wires and switches that exist in the microprocessor, and that guide the motion of the electrons.</p>\n<p>In living systems one sometimes also cares about the transport of electrons—though more often it&#8217;s atoms and ions and molecules. And living systems often seem to provide what one can think of as a close analog of wires for transporting such things. But what is the arrangement of these “wires”? Ultimately it&#8217;ll be defined by the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-5--fundamental-issues-in-biology'>application of rules</a> derived from things like the genome of the organism. Sometimes the results will for example be analogous to crystalline or amorphous solids. But in other cases one suspects that it&#8217;ll be better described by something like the mechanoidal phase.</p>\n<p>Quite possibly this may also provide a good bulk description of technological systems like microprocessors or large software codebases. And potentially then one might be able to have high-level laws—analogous to the Second Law—that would make high-level statements about these technological systems.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that a key feature of the mechanoidal phase is that detailed dynamics—and the causal relations it defines—matter. In something like a gas it’s perfectly fine for most purposes to assume “molecular chaos”, and to say that molecules are arbitrarily mixed. But the mechanoidal phase depends on the “detailed choreography” of elements. It’s still a “bulk phase” with arbitrarily many elements. But things like the detailed history of interactions of each individual element matter. </p>\n<p>In thinking about typical chemistry—say in a liquid or gas phase—one’s usually just concerned with overall concentrations of different kinds of molecules. In effect one assumes that the “Second Law has acted”, and that everything is “mixed randomly” and the causal histories of molecules don’t matter. But it’s increasingly clear that this <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>picture isn&#8217;t correct for molecular biology</a>, with all its detailed molecular-scale structures and mechanisms. And instead it seems more promising to model what’s there as being in the mechanoidal phase. </p>\n<p>So how does this relate to the Second Law? As we’ve discussed, the Second Law is ultimately a reflection of the interplay between underlying computational irreducibility and the limited computational capabilities of observers like us. But within computational irreducibility there are inevitably always “pockets” of computational reducibility—which the observer may or may not care about, or be able to leverage.</p>\n<p>In the mechanoidal phase there is ultimately computational irreducibility. But a defining feature of this phase is the presence of “local computational reducibility” visible in the existence of identifiable localized structures. Or, in other words, even to observers like us, it’s clear that the mechanoidal phase isn’t “uniformly computationally irreducible”. But just what general statements can be made about it will depend—potentially in some detail—on the characteristics of the observer.</p>\n<p>We’ve managed to get a long way in discussing the Second Law—and even more so in doing our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>—by making only very <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>basic assumptions about observers</a>. But to be able to make general statements about the mechanoidal phase—and living systems—we’re likely to have to say more about observers. If one’s presented with a lump of biological tissue one might at first just describe it as some kind of gel. But we know there’s much more to it. And the question is what features we can perceive. Right now we can see with microscopes all kinds of elaborate spatial structures. Perhaps in the future there’ll be technology that also lets us systematically detect dynamic and causal structures. And it’ll be the interplay of what we perceive with what’s computationally going on underneath that’ll define what general laws we will be able to see emerge. </p>\n<p>We already know we won’t just get the ordinary Second Law. But just what we will get isn’t clear. But somehow—perhaps in several variants associated with different kinds of observers—what we’ll get will be something like “general laws of biology”, much like in our Physics Project we get general laws of spacetime and of quantum mechanics, and in our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>analysis of metamathematics we get &#8220;general laws of mathematics&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='the-thermodynamics-of-spacetime'>The Thermodynamics of Spacetime</h2>\n<p>Traditional twentieth-century physics treats spacetime a bit like a continuous fluid, with its characteristics being defined by the continuum equations of General Relativity. Attempts to align this with quantum field theory led to the idea of attributing an entropy to black holes, in essence to represent the number of quantum states “hidden” by the event horizon of the black hole. But in our Physics Project there is a much more direct way of thinking about spacetime in what amount to thermodynamic terms.</p>\n<p>A key idea of our Physics Project is that there’s something “below” the “fluid” representation of spacetime—and in particular that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>space is ultimately made of discrete elements</a>, whose relations (which can conveniently be represented by a hypergraph) ultimately define everything about the structure of space. This structure evolves according to rules that are somewhat analogous to those for block cellular automata, except that now one is doing replacements not for blocks of cell values, but instead for local pieces of the hypergraph. </p>\n<p>So what happens in a system like this? Sometimes the behavior is simple. But very often—much like in many cellular automata—there is great complexity in the structure that develops even from simple initial conditions:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img220_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img220.png\" alt='' title='' width='559' height='196'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>It’s again a story of computational irreducibility, and of the generation of apparent randomness. The notion of “randomness” is a bit less straightforward for hypergraphs than for arrays of cell values. But what ultimately matters is what “observers like us” perceive in the system. A typical approach is to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/the-notion-of-dimension' target=_blank rel=noopener>look at geodesic balls</a> that encompass all elements within a certain graph distance of a given element—and then to study the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/' target=_blank rel=noopener>effective geometry that emerges</a> in the large-scale limit. It’s then a bit like seeing fluid dynamics emerge from small-scale molecular dynamics, except that here (after <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Documents/some-relativistic-and-gravitational-properties-of-the-wolfram-model.pdf'>navigating many technical issues</a>) it’s the Einstein equations of General Relativity that emerge.</p>\n<p>But the fact that this can work relies on something analogous to the Second Law. It has to be the case that the evolution of the hypergraph leads at least locally to something that can be viewed as “uniformly random”, and on which statistical averages can be done. In effect, the microscopic structure of spacetime is reaching some kind of “equilibrium state”, whose detailed internal configuration “seems random”—but which has definite “bulk” properties that are perceived by observers like us, and give us the impression of continuous spacetime.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, the phenomenon of computational irreducibility means that apparent randomness can arise completely deterministically just by following simple rules from simple initial conditions. And this is presumably what basically happens in the evolution and “formation” of spacetime. (There are some additional complications associated with multicomputation that we’ll discuss at least to some extent later.)</p>\n<p>But just like for the systems like gases that we’ve discussed above, we can now start talking directly about things like entropy for spacetime. As “large-scale observers” of spacetime we’re always effectively doing coarse graining. So now we can ask how many microscopic configurations of spacetime (or space) are consistent with whatever result we get from that coarse graining.</p>\n<p>As a toy example, consider just enumerating all possible graphs (say up to a given size), then asking which of them have a certain pattern of volumes for <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/the-notion-of-dimension/' target=_blank rel=noopener>geodesic balls</a> (i.e. a certain sequence of numbers of distinct nodes within a given graph distance of a particular node). The “coarse-grained entropy” is simply determined by the number of graphs in which the geodesic ball volumes start in the same way. Here are all trivalent graphs (with up to 24 nodes) that have various such geodesic ball “signatures” (most, but not all, turn out to be vertex transitive; these graphs were found by filtering a total of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-7--trivalent-networks/'>125,816,453 possibilities</a>):</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img221_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img221.png\" alt='' title='' width='574' height='769'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>We can think of the different numbers of graphs in each case as representing different entropies for a tiny fragment of space constrained to have a given “coarse-grained” structure. At the graph sizes we’re dealing with here, we’re very far from having a good approximation to continuum space. But assume we could look at much larger graphs. Then we might ask how the entropy varies with “limiting geodesic ball signature”—which in the continuum limit is determined by dimension, curvature, etc. </p>\n<p>For a general “disembodied lump of spacetime” this is all somewhat hard to define, particularly because it depends greatly on issues of “gauge” or of how the spacetime is foliated into spacelike slices. But event horizons, being in a sense much more global, don’t have such issues, and so we can expect to have fairly invariant definitions of spacetime entropy in this case. And the expectation would then be that for example the entropy we would compute would agree with the “standard” entropy computed for example by analyzing quantum fields or strings near a black hole. But with the setup we have here we should also be able to ask more general questions about spacetime entropy—for example seeing how it varies with features of arbitrary gravitational fields.</p>\n<p>In most situations the spacetime entropy associated with any spacetime configuration that we can successfully identify at our coarse-grained level will be very large. But if we could ever find a case where it is instead small, this would be somewhere we could expect to start seeing a breakdown of the continuum “equilibrium” structure of spacetime, and where evidence of discreteness should start to show up.</p>\n<p>We’ve so far mostly been discussing hypergraphs that represent instantaneous states of space.

And one of the results of our Physics Project is then that the flux of causal edges through the spacelike hypersurfaces our foliation defines can be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>interpreted directly as the density of physical energy</a>. (The flux through timelike hypersurfaces gives momentum.)</p>\n<p>One can make a surprisingly close analogy to causal graphs for hard-sphere gases—except that in a hard-sphere gas the causal edges correspond to actual, nonrelativistic motion of idealized molecules, while in our model of spacetime the causal edges are abstract connections that are in effect always lightlike (i.e. they correspond to motion at the speed of light). In both cases, reducing the number of events is like reducing some version of temperature—and if one approaches no-event “absolute zero” both the gas and spacetime will lose their cohesion, and no longer allow propagation of effects from one part of the system to another. </p>\n<p>If one increases density in the hard-sphere gas one will eventually <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>form something like a solid</a>, and in this case there will be a regular arrangement of both spheres and the causal edges. In spacetime something similar may happen in connection with event horizons—which may behave like an “ordered phase” with causal edges aligned.</p>\n<p>What happens if one combines thinking about spacetime and thinking about matter? A long-unresolved issue concerns systems with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1021b/'>many gravitationally attracting bodies</a>—say a &#8220;gas&#8221; of stars or galaxies. While the molecules in an ordinary gas might evolve to an apparently random configuration in a standard “Second Law way”, gravitationally attracting bodies tend to clump together to make what seem like &#8220;progressively simpler&#8221; configurations.</p>\n<p>It could be that this is a case where the standard Second Law just doesn&#8217;t apply, but there&#8217;s long been a suspicion that the Second Law can somehow be &#8220;saved&#8221; by appropriately associating an entropy with the structure of spacetime. In our Physics Project, as we&#8217;ve discussed, there&#8217;s always entropy associated with our coarse-grained perception of spacetime. And it&#8217;s conceivable that, at least in terms of overall counting of states, increased &#8220;organization&#8221; of matter could be more than balanced by enlargement in the number of available states for spacetime.</p>\n<p>We’ve discussed at length above the idea that “Second Law behavior” is the result of us as observers (and preparers of initial states) being “computationally weak” relative to the computational irreducibility of the underlying dynamics of systems. And we can expect that very much the same thing will happen for spacetime. But what if we could make a Maxwell’s demon for spacetime? What would this mean?</p>\n<p>One rather bizarre possibility is that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/'>it could allow faster-than-light &#8220;travel&#8221;</a>. Here’s a rough analogy. Gas molecules—say in air in a room—move at roughly the speed of sound. But they’re always colliding with other molecules, and getting their directions randomized. But what if we had a Maxwell’s-demon-like device that could tell us at every collision which molecule to ride on? With an appropriate choice for the sequence of molecules we could then potentially “surf” across the room at roughly the speed of sound. Of course, to have the device work it’d have to overcome the computational irreducibility of the basic dynamics of the gas.</p>\n<p>In spacetime, the causal graph gives us a map of what event can affect what other event. And insofar as we just treat spacetime as “being in uniform equilibrium” there’ll be a simple correspondence between “causal distance” and what we consider distance in physical space. But if we look down at the level of individual causal edges it’ll be more complicated. And in general we could imagine that an appropriate “demon” could predict the microscopic causal structure of spacetime, and carefully pick causal edges that could “line up” to “go further in space” than the “equilibrium expectation”.</p>\n<p>Of course, even if this worked, there’s still the question of what could be “transported” through such a “tunnel”—and for example even a particle (like an electron) presumably involves a vast number of causal edges, that one wouldn’t be able to systematically organize to fit through the tunnel. But it’s interesting to realize that in our Physics Project the idea that “nothing can go faster than light” becomes something very much analogous to the Second Law: not a fundamental statement about underlying rules, but rather a statement about our interaction with them, and our capabilities as observers.</p>\n<p>So if there’s something like the Second Law that leads to the structure of spacetime as we typically perceive it, what can be said about typical issues in thermodynamics in connection with spacetime? For example, what’s the story with perpetual motion machines in spacetime? </p>\n<p>Even before talking about the Second Law, there are already issues with the First Law of Thermodynamics—because in a cosmological setting there isn’t local conservation of energy as such, and for example the expansion of the universe can transfer energy to things. But what about the Second Law question of “getting mechanical work from heat”? Presumably the analog of “mechanical work” is a gravitational field that is “sufficiently organized” that observers like us can readily detect it, say by seeing it pull objects in definite directions. And presumably a perpetual motion machine based on violating the Second Law would then have to take the heat-like randomness in “ordinary spacetime” and somehow organize it into a systematic and measurable gravitational field. Or, in other words, “perpetual motion” would somehow have to involve a gravitational field “spontaneously being generated” from the microscopic structure of spacetime.</p>\n<p>Just like in ordinary thermodynamics, the impossibility of doing this involves an interplay between the observer and the underlying system. And conceivably it might be possible that there could be an observer who can measure specific features of spacetime that correspond to some slice of computational reducibility in the underlying dynamics—say some weird configuration of “spontaneous motion” of objects. But absent this, a “Second-Law-violating” perpetual motion machine will be impossible.</p>\n<h2 id='quantum-mechanics'>Quantum Mechanics</h2>\n<p>Like statistical mechanics (and thermodynamics), quantum mechanics is usually thought of as a statistical theory. But whereas the statistical character of statistical mechanics one imagines to come from a definite, knowable “mechanism underneath”, the statistical character of quantum mechanics has usually just been treated as a formal, underivable “fact of physics”.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, however, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>the story is different</a>, and there’s a whole lower-level structure—ultimately rooted in the ruliad—from which quantum mechanics and its statistical character appears to be derived. And, as we’ll discuss, that derivation in the end has close connections both to what we’ve said about the standard Second Law, and to what we’ve said about the thermodynamics of spacetime. </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project the starting point for quantum mechanics is the unavoidable fact that when one’s applying rules to transform hypergraphs, there’s typically more than one rewrite that can be done to any given hypergraph. And the result of this is that there are many different possible “paths of history” for the universe.</p>\n<p>As a simple analog, consider rewriting not hypergraphs but strings. And doing this, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/string-substitution-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>we get for example</a>: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img225_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img225.png\" alt='' title='' width='443' height='240'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>This is a deterministic representation of all possible “paths of history”, but in a sense it’s very wasteful, among other things because it includes multiple copies of identical strings (like BBBB).

So how is it that we as observers perceive definite things to happen in the world? Ultimately it’s a story of coarse graining, and of us conflating different paths in the multiway graph.</p>\n<p>But there’s a wrinkle here. In statistical mechanics we imagine that we can observe from outside the system, implementing our coarse graining by sampling particular features of the system. But in quantum mechanics we imagine that the multiway system describes the whole universe, including us. So then we have the peculiar situation that just as the universe is branching and merging, so too are our brains. And ultimately what we observe is therefore the result of a branching brain perceiving a branching universe.</p>\n<p>But given all those branches, can we just decide to conflate them into a single thread of experience? In a sense this is a typical question of coarse graining and of what we can consistently equivalence together. But there’s something a bit different here because without the “coarse graining” we can’t talk at all about “what happened”, only about what might be happening. Put another way, we’re now fundamentally dealing not with computation (like in a cellular automaton) but with multicomputation.</p>\n<p>And in multicomputation, there are always two fundamental kinds of operations: the generation of new states from old, and the equivalencing of states, effectively by the observer. In ordinary computation, there can be computational irreducibility in the process of generating a thread of successive states. In multicomputation, there can be <a href='https://www.wolframinstitute.org/bulletins/2022/06/multicomputational-irreducibility/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multicomputational irreducibility</a> in which in a sense all computations in the multiway system have to be done in order even to determine a single equivalenced result. Or, put another way, you can’t shortcut following all the paths of history. If you try to equivalence at the beginning, the equivalence class you’ve built will inevitably be “shredded” by the evolution, forcing you to follow each path separately.</p>\n<p>It’s worth commenting that just as in classical mechanics, the “underlying dynamics” in our description of quantum mechanics are reversible. In the original unmerged evolution tree above, we could just reverse each rule and from any point uniquely construct a “backwards tree”. But once we start merging and equivalencing, there isn’t the same kind of “direct reversibility”—though we can still count possible paths to determine that we preserve “total probability”.</p>\n<p>In ordinary computational systems, computational irreducibility implies that even from simple initial conditions we can get behavior that “seems random” with respect to most computationally bounded observations. And something directly analogous happens in multicomputational systems. From simple initial conditions, we generate collections of paths of history that “seem random” with respect to computationally bounded equivalencing operations, or, in other words, to observers who do computationally bounded coarse graining of different paths of history.</p>\n<p>When we look at the graphs we’ve drawn representing the evolution of a multiway system, we can think of there being a time direction that goes down the page, following the arrows that point from states to their successors. But across the page, in the transverse direction, we can think of there as being a space in which different paths of history are laid—what we call “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>”. </p>\n<p>A typical way to start constructing branchial space is to take slices across the multiway graph, then to form a branchial graph in which two states are joined if they have a common ancestor on the step before (which means we can consider them “entangled”):</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img227_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img227.png\" alt='' title='' width='506' height='296'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Although the details remain to be clarified, it seems as if in the standard formalism of quantum mechanics, distance in branchial space corresponds essentially to quantum phase, so that, for example, particles whose phases would make them show destructive interference will be at “opposite ends” of branchial space. </p>\n<p>So how do observers relate to branchial space? Basically what an observer is doing is to coarse grain in branchial space, equivalencing certain paths of history. And just as we have a certain extent in physical space, which determines our coarse graining of gases, and—at a much smaller scale—of the structure of spacetime, so also we have an extent in branchial space that determines our coarse graining across branches of history.</p>\n<p>But this is where multicomputational irreducibility and the analog of the Second Law are crucial. Because just as we imagine that gases—and spacetime—achieve a certain kind of “unique random equilibrium” that leads us to be able to make consistent measurements of them, so also we can imagine that in quantum mechanics there is in effect a “branchial space equilibrium” that is achieved.</p>\n<p>Think of a box of gas in equilibrium. Put two pistons on different sides of the box. So long as they don’t perturb the gas too much, they’ll both record the same pressure. And in our Physics Project it’s the same story with observers and quantum mechanics. Most of the time there’ll be enough effective randomness generated by the multicomputationally irreducible evolution of the system (which is completely deterministic at the level of the multiway graph) that a computationally bounded observer will always see the same “equilibrium values”.</p>\n<p>A central feature of quantum mechanics is that by making sufficiently careful measurements one can see what appear to be random results. But where does that randomness come from? In the usual formalism for quantum mechanics, the idea of purely probabilistic results is just burnt into the formal structure. But in our Physics Project, the apparent randomness one sees has a definite, “mechanistic” origin. And it’s basically the same as the origin of randomness for the standard Second Law, except that now we’re dealing with multicomputational rather than pure computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>By the way, the “Bell’s inequality” statement that quantum mechanics cannot be based on “mechanistic randomness” unless it comes from a nonlocal theory remains true in our Physics Project. But in the Physics Project we have an immediate ubiquitous source of “nonlocality”: the equivalencing or coarse graining “across” branchial space done by observers.</p>\n<p>(We’re not discussing the role of physical space here. But suffice it to say that instead of having each node of the multiway graph represent a complete state of the universe, we can make an extended multiway graph in which different spatial elements—like different paths of history—are separated, with their “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-relationship-between-graphs-and-the-multiway-causal-graph/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal entanglements</a>” then defining the actual structure of space, in a spatial analog of the branchial graph.)</p>\n<p>As we’ve already noted, the complete multiway graph is entirely deterministic. And indeed if we have a complete branchial slice of the graph, this can be used to determine the whole future of the graph (the analog of “unitary evolution” in the standard formalism of quantum mechanics). But if we equivalence states—corresponding to “doing a measurement”—then we won’t have enough information to uniquely determine the future of the system, at least when it comes to what we consider to be quantum effects. </p>\n<p>At the outset, we might have thought that statistical mechanics, spacetime mechanics and quantum mechanics were all very different theories. But what our Physics Project suggests is that in fact they are all based on a common, fundamentally computational phenomenon. </p>\n<p>So what about other ideas associated with the standard Second Law? How do they work in the quantum case? </p>\n<p>Entropy, for example, now just becomes a measure of the number of possible configurations of a branchial graph consistent with a certain coarse-grained measurement. Two independent systems will have disconnected branchial graphs. But as soon as the systems interact, their branchial graphs will connect, and the number of possible graph configurations will change, leading to an “entanglement entropy”.</p>\n<p>One question about the quantum analog of the Second Law is what might correspond to “mechanical work”. There may very well be highly structured branchial graphs—conceivably associated with things like coherent states—but it isn’t yet clear how they work and whether existing kinds of measurements can readily detect them. But one can expect that multicomputational irreducibility will tend to produce branchial graphs that can’t be “decoded” by most computationally bounded measurements—so that, for example, “quantum perpetual motion”, in which “branchial organization” is spontaneously produced, can’t happen.</p>\n<p>And in the end randomness in quantum measurements is happening for essentially the same basic reason we’d see randomness if we looked at small numbers of molecules in a gas: it’s not that there’s anything fundamentally not deterministic underneath, it’s just there’s a computational process that’s making things too complicated for us to “decode”, at least as observers with bounded computational capabilities. In the case of the gas, though, we’re sampling molecules at different places in physical space. But in quantum mechanics we’re doing the slightly more abstract thing of sampling states of the system at different places in branchial space. But the same fundamental randomization is happening, though now through multicomputational irreducibility operating in branchial space.</p>\n<h2 id='the-future-of-the-second-law'>The Future of the Second Law</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>original formulation of the Second Law a century and a half ago</a>—before even the existence of molecules was established—was an impressive achievement. And one might assume that over the course of 150 years—with all the mathematics and physics that’s been done—a complete foundational understanding of the Second Law would long ago have been developed. But in fact it has not. And from what we’ve discussed here we can now see why. It’s because the Second Law is ultimately a computational phenomenon, and to understand it requires an understanding of the computational paradigm that’s only very recently emerged.</p>\n<p>Once one starts doing actual computational experiments in the computational universe (<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>as I already did in the early 1980s</a>) the core phenomenon of the Second Law is surprisingly obvious—even if it violates one’s traditional intuition about how things should work. But in the end, as we have discussed here, the Second Law is a reflection of a very general, if deeply computational, idea: an interplay between computational irreducibility and the computational limitations of observers like us. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> tells us that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> is inevitable. But the limitation of observers is something different: it’s a kind of epiprinciple of science that’s in effect a formalization of our human experience and our way of doing science.</p>\n<p>Can we tighten up the formulation of all this? Undoubtedly. We have various standard models of the computational process—like Turing machines and cellular automata. We still need to develop an “observer theory” that provides standard models for what observers like us can do. And the more we can develop such a theory, the more we can expect to make explicit proofs of specific statements about the Second Law. Ultimately these proofs will have solid foundations in the Principle of Computational Equivalence (although there remains much to formalize there too), but will rely on models for what “observers like us” can be like.</p>\n<p>So how general do we expect the Second Law to be in the end? In the past couple of sections we’ve seen that the core of the Second Law extends to spacetime and to quantum mechanics. But even when it comes to the standard subject matter of statistical mechanics, we expect limitations and exceptions to the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility and the Principle of Computational Equivalence are very general, but not very specific. They talk about the overall computational sophistication of systems and processes. But they do not say that there are no simplifying features. And indeed we expect that in any system that shows computational irreducibility, there will always be arbitrarily many “slices of computational reducibility” that can be found. </p>\n<p>The question then is whether those slices of reducibility will be what an observer can perceive, or will care about. If they are, then one won’t see Second Law behavior. If they’re not, one will just see “generic computational irreducibility” and Second Law behavior.</p>\n<p>How can one find the slices of reducibility? Well, in general that’s irreducibly hard. Every slice of reducibility is in a sense a new scientific or mathematical principle. And the computational irreducibility involved in finding such reducible slices basically speaks to the ultimately unbounded character of the scientific and mathematical enterprise. But once again, even though there might be an infinite number of slices of reducibility, we still have to ask which ones matter to us as observers.</p>\n<p>The answer could be one thing for studying gases, and another, for example, for studying molecular biology, or social dynamics. The question of whether we’ll see “Second Law behavior” then boils to whether whatever we’re studying turns out to be something that doesn’t simplify, and ends up showing computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>If we have a sufficiently small system—with few enough components—then the computational irreducibility may not be “strong enough” to stop us from “going beyond the Second Law”, and for example constructing a successful Maxwell’s demon. And indeed as computer and sensor technology improve, it’s becoming increasingly feasible to do measurement and set up control systems that effectively avoid the Second Law in particular, small systems.</p>\n<p>But in general the future of the Second Law and its applicability is really all about how the capabilities of observers develop. What will future technology, and future paradigms, do to our ability to pick away at computational irreducibility?</p>\n<p>In the context of the ruliad, we are currently localized in rulial space based on our existing capabilities. But as we develop further we are in effect <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>&#8220;colonizing&#8221; rulial space</a>. And a system that may look random—and may seem to follow the Second Law—from one place in rulial space may be “revealed as simple” from another.</p>\n<p>There is an issue, though. Because the more we as observers spread out in rulial space, the less coherent our experience will become. In effect we’ll be following a larger bundle of threads in rulial space, which makes who “we” are less definite. And in the limit we’ll presumably be able to encompass all slices of computational reducibility, but at the cost of having our experience “incoherently spread” across all of them.</p>\n<p>It’s in the end some kind of tradeoff. Either we can have a coherent thread of experience, in which case we’ll conclude that the world produces apparent randomness, as the Second Law suggests. Or we can develop to the point where we’ve “spread our experience” and no longer have coherence as observers, but can recognize enough regularities that the Second Law potentially seems irrelevant.</p>\n<p>But as of now, the Second Law is still very much with us, even if we are beginning to see some of its limitations. And with our computational paradigm we are finally in a position to see its foundations, and understand how it ultimately works.</p>\n<p id='thanks-and-notes' style=\"color:#c42c1f\"><em>Thanks &#038; Notes</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Thanks to Brad Klee, Kegan Allen, Jonathan Gorard, Matt Kafker, Ed Pegg and Michael Trott for their help—as well as to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>many people who have contributed</a> to my understanding of the Second Law over the 50+ years I’ve been interested in it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Wolfram Language to generate every image here is available by clicking the image in the online version.

Building on an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>earlier interest in space and spacecraft</a>, I’d gotten very interested in physics, and was trying to read everything I could about it. There were several shelves of physics books at the <a href='https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/about' target=_blank rel=noopener>local bookstore</a>. But what I coveted most was the largest physics book collection there: a series of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Physics_Course' target=_blank rel=noopener>five plushly illustrated college textbooks</a>. And as a kind of graduation gift when I finished <a href='https://www.dragonschool.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>(British) elementary school</a> in June 1972 I arranged to get those books. And here they are, still on my bookshelf today, just a little faded, more than half a century later:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img1.png\" width='640' height='275'></a><span id=\"more-42176\"></span></p>\n<p>For a while the first book in the series was my favorite. Then the third. The second. The fourth. <a href='https://archive.org/details/berkeleyphysicsc05kitt/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>The fifth one</a> at first seemed quite mysterious—and somehow more abstract in its goals than the others:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img2.png\" width='530' height='526'></a></p>\n<p>What story was the filmstrip on its cover telling? For a couple of months I didn’t look seriously at the book. And I spent much of the summer of 1972 writing my own (unseen by anyone else for 30+ years) <em><a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/concise-directory-physics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Concise Directory of Physics</a></em></p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img3.png\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/concise-directory-physics.pdf#page=35\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img3.png\"width='620' height='270'></a></p>\n<p>that included a rather stiff page about energy, mentioning entropy—along with the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-heat-death-of-the-universe'>heat death of the universe</a>.</p>\n<p>But one afternoon late that summer I decided I should really find out what that mysterious fifth book was all about. Memory being what it is I remember that—very unusually for me—I took the book to read sitting on the grass under some trees. And, yes, my archives almost let me check my recollection: in the distance, there’s the spot, except in 1967 the trees are significantly smaller, and in 1985 they’re bigger:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img4.png\" width='640' height='289'></a></p>\n<p>Of course, by 1972 I was a little bigger than in 1967—and here I am a little later, complete with a book called <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Planets-Life-P-H-Sneath/dp/0500100047' target=_blank rel=noopener>Planets and Life</a></em> on the ground, along with a tube of (British) Smarties, and, yes, a pocket protector (but, hey, those were actual ink pens):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img5.png\"width='316' height='440'></a></p>\n<p>But back to the mysterious green book. It wasn’t like anything I’d seen before. It was full of pictures like the one on the cover. And it seemed to be saying that—just by looking at those pictures and thinking—one could figure out fundamental things about physics. The other books I’d read had all basically said “physics works like this”. But here was a book saying “you can figure out how physics has to work”. Back then I definitely hadn’t internalized it, but I think what was so exciting that day was that I got a first taste of the idea that one didn’t have to be told how the world works; one could just figure it out:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img6.png\"width='620' height='383'></a></p>\n<p>I didn’t yet understand quite a bit of the math in the book. But it didn’t seem so relevant to the core phenomenon the book was apparently talking about: the tendency of things to become more random. I remember wondering how this related to stars being organized into galaxies. Why might that be different? The book didn’t seem to say, though I thought maybe somewhere it was buried in the math.</p>\n<p>But soon the summer was over, and I was at a <a href='https://www.etoncollege.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>new school</a>, mostly away from my books, and doing things like diligently learning more Latin and Greek. But whenever I could I was learning more about physics—and particularly about the hot area of the time: particle physics. The pions. The kaons. The lambda hyperon. They all became my personal friends. During the school vacations I would excitedly bicycle the few miles to the <a href='https://www.reading.ac.uk/library/' target=_blank rel=noopener>nearby university library</a> to check out the latest journals and the latest news about particle physics.</p>\n<p>The school I was at (<a href='https://www.etoncollege.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Eton</a>) had five centuries of history, and I think at first I assumed no particular bridge to the future. But it wasn&#8217;t long before I started hearing mentions that somewhere at the school there was a computer. I&#8217;d seen a computer in real life only once—when I was 10 years old, and from a distance. But now, tucked away at the edge of the school, above a bicycle repair shed, there was an island of modernity, a &#8220;computer room&#8221; with a glass partition separating off a loudly humming desk-sized piece of electronics that I could actually touch and use: an <a href='http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/32480/Elliott-903' target=_blank rel=noopener>Elliott 903C computer</a> with 8 kilowords of 18-bit ferrite core memory (acquired by the school in 1970 for £12,000, or about about $300k today):</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\"><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"Source: © Jim Austin Computer Collection at The Computer Sheds &#038; Neil Barrett Photography\" title=\"Source: © Jim Austin Computer Collection at The Computer Sheds &#038; Neil Barrett Photography\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img7.png\"width='389' height='369'></a></p>\n<p>At first it was such an unfamiliar novelty that I was satisfied writing little programs to do things like compute primes, print curious patterns on the teleprinter, and play tunes with the built-in diagnostic tone generator. But it wasn’t long before I set my sights on the goal of using the computer to reproduce that interesting picture on the book cover.</p>\n<p>I programmed in assembler, with my programs on paper tape. The computer had <a href='http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/downloads/39396' target=_blank rel=noopener>just 16 machine instructions</a>, which included arithmetic ones, but only for integers. So how was I going to simulate colliding “molecules” with that? Somewhat sheepishly, I decided to put everything on a grid, with everything represented by discrete elements. There was a convention for people to name their programs starting with their own first initial. So I called the program SPART, for “Stephen’s Particle Program”. (Thinking about it today, maybe that name reflected some aspiration of relating this to particle physics.)</p>\n<p>It was the most complicated program I had ever written. And it was hard to test, because, after all, I didn’t really know what to expect it to do. Over the course of several months, it went through many versions. Rather often the program would just mysteriously crash before producing any output (and, yes, there weren’t real debugging tools yet). But eventually I got it to systematically produce output. But to my disappointment the output never looked much like the book cover.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know why, but I assumed it was because I was simplifying things too much, putting everything on a grid, etc. A decade later I realized that in writing my program I’d actually ended up inventing a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>form of 2D cellular automaton</a>. And I now rather suspect that this cellular automaton—like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>rule 30</a>—was actually intrinsically generating randomness, and in some sense showing what I now understand to be the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>core phenomenon of the Second Law</a>. But at the time I absolutely wasn’t ready for this, and instead I just assumed that what I was seeing was something wrong and irrelevant. (In past years, I had suspected that what went wrong had to do with <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>details of particle behavior on square</a>—as opposed to other—grids. But I now suspect it was instead that the system was in a sense generating too much randomness, making the intended “molecular dynamics” unrecognizable.)</p>\n<p>I’d love to “bring SPART back to life”, but I don’t seem to have a copy anymore, and I’m pretty sure the printouts I got as output back in 1973 seemed so “wrong” I didn’t keep them. I do still have quite a few paper tapes from around that time, but as of now I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s on them—not least because I wrote my own &#8220;advanced&#8221; paper-tape loader, which used what I later learned were error-correcting codes to try to avoid problems with pieces of “confetti” getting stuck in the holes that had been punched in the tape:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img8.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img8.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='394' height='476'></a> </p>\n<h2 id='becoming-a-physicist'>Becoming a Physicist</h2>\n<p>I don’t know what would have happened if I’d thought my program was more successful in reproducing “Second Law” behavior back in 1973 when I was 13 years old. But as it was, in the summer of 1973 I was away from “my” computer, and spending all my time on particle physics. And between that summer and early 1974 I wrote a book-length summary of what I called “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/physics-subatomic-particles.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>The Physics of Subatomic Particles</a>”:</p>\n<p>\t\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img9.png\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/physics-subatomic-particles.pdf#page=3\"> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img9.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='515' height='367'></a></p>\n<p>I don’t think I’d looked at this in any detail in 48 years. But reading it now I am a bit shocked to find history and explanations that I think are often better than I would immediately give today—even if they do bear definite signs of coming from a British early teenager writing “scientific prose”.</p>\n<p>Did I talk about statistical mechanics and the Second Law? Not directly, though there’s a curious passage where I speculate about the possibility of antimatter galaxies, and their (rather un-Second-Law-like) segregation from ordinary, matter galaxies:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/physics-subatomic-particles.pdf#page=23\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img10.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img10.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='115'></a></p>\n<p>By the next summer I was writing the 230-page, much more technical “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/introduction-weak-interaction-volume-one.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Introduction to the Weak Interaction</a>”. Lots of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. No statistical mechanics. The closest it gets is a chapter on CP violation (AKA time-reversal violation)—a longtime favorite topic of mine—but from a very particle-physics point of view. By the next year I was <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/all/'>publishing papers about particle physics</a>, with no statistical mechanics in sight—though in a picture of me (as a “lanky youth”) from that time, the <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/berkeleyphysicsc05kitt/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Statistical Physics</a></em> book is right there on my shelf, albeit surrounded by particle physics books:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img11.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img11.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='404' height='432'></a></p>\n<p>But despite my focus on particle physics, I still kept thinking about statistical mechanics and the Second Law, and particularly its implications for the large-scale structure of the universe, and things like the possibility of matter-antimatter separation. And in early 1977, now 17 years old, and (briefly) a college student in Oxford, my archives record that I gave a talk to the newly formed (and short-lived) Oxford Natural Science Club entitled “Whither Physics” in which I talked about “large, small, many” as the main frontiers of physics, and presented the visual</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img12.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img12.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='448' height='585'></a></p>\n<p>with a dash of “unsolved purple” impinging on statistical mechanics, particularly in connection with non-equilibrium situations. Meanwhile, looking at my archives today, I find some “back of the envelope” equilibrium statistical mechanics from that time (though I have no idea now what this was about):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img13.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img13.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='370' height='410'></a></p>\n<p>But then, in the fall of 1977 I ended up for the first time really needing to use statistical mechanics “in production”. I had gotten interested in what would later become a hot area: the intersection between particle physics and the early universe. One of my interests was <a href='https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/NeutrinoBackgroundRadiation.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>neutrino background radiation</a> (the neutrino analog of the cosmic microwave background); another was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/abundances-new-stable-particles-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>early-universe production of stable charged particles</a> heavier than the proton. And it turned out that to study these I needed all three of cosmology, particle physics, and statistical mechanics:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/abundances-new-stable-particles-early-universe.pdf\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img14.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='412'></a></p>\n<p>In the couple of years that followed, I worked on <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/all/'>all sorts of topics in particle physics and in cosmology</a>. Quite often ideas from statistical mechanics would show up, like when I worked on the <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/model-parton-showers-qcd.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>hadronization of quarks and gluons</a>, or when I worked on <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/expansion-rate-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>phase transitions in the early universe</a>. But it wasn’t until 1979 that the Second Law made its first explicit appearance by name in my published work.</p>\n<p>I was studying how there could be a <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/development-baryon-asymmetry-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>net excess of matter over antimatter throughout the universe</a> (yes, I’d by then given up on the idea of matter-antimatter separation). It was a subtle story of quantum field theory, time reversal violation, General Relativity—and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. And in the <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/development-baryon-asymmetry-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>paper we wrote</a> we included a detailed appendix about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>Boltzmann&#8217;s <em>H</em> theorem</a> and the Second Law—and the generalization we needed for relativistic quantum time-reversal-violating systems in an expanding universe:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321380901674\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img15.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='658'></a></p>\n<p>All this got me thinking again about the foundations of the Second Law. The physicists I was around mostly weren’t too interested in such topics—though <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/short-talk-about-richard-feynman/'>Richard Feynman</a> was something of an exception. And indeed when I did my <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/a-precociousness-record-almost-broken/'>PhD thesis defense in November 1979</a> it ended up devolving into a spirited multi-hour debate with Feynman about the Second Law. He maintained that the Second Law must ultimately cause everything to randomize, and that the order we see in the universe today <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>must be some kind of temporary fluctuation</a>. I took the point of view that there was something else going on, perhaps related to gravity. Today I would have more strongly made the rather Feynmanesque point that if you have a theory that says everything we observe today is an exception to your theory, then the theory you have isn’t terribly useful.</p>\n<h2 id='statistical-mechanics-and-simple-programs'>Statistical Mechanics and Simple Programs</h2>\n<p>Back in 1973 I never really managed to do much science on the very first computer I used. But by 1976 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>I had access to much bigger and faster computers</a> (as well as to the ARPANET—forerunner of the internet). And soon I was routinely using computers as powerful tools for physics, and particularly for symbolic manipulation. But by late 1979 I had basically outgrown the software systems that existed, and within weeks of getting my PhD I embarked on the project of building my own computational system.</p>\n<p>It’s a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>story I&#8217;ve told elsewhere</a>, but one of the important elements for our purposes here is that in designing the system I called <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/smp-symbolic-manipulation-program/'>SMP (for &#8220;Symbolic Manipulation Program&#8221;)</a> I ended up digging deeply into the foundations of computation, and its connections to areas like mathematical logic. But even as I was developing the critical-to-<a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram-Language</a>-to-this-day paradigm of basing everything on transformations for symbolic expressions, as well as leading the software engineering to actually build SMP, I was also continuing to think about physics and its foundations.</p>\n<p>There was often something of a statistical mechanics orientation to what I did. I worked on <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cosmology-very-large-gauge-models.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>cosmology where even the collection of possible particle species had to be treated statistically</a>. I worked on the <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/properties-vacuum-mechanical-thermodynamic.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>quantum field theory of the vacuum</a>—or effectively the “bulk properties of quantized fields”. I worked on what amounts to the <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/CosmologicalStrings005.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>statistical mechanics of cosmological strings</a>. And I started working on the quantum-field-theory-meets-statistical-mechanics problem of “relativistic matter” (where my unfinished notes contain questions like “Does causality forbid relativistic solids?”):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img16.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='395'></a></p>\n<p>But hovering around all of this was my old interest in the Second Law, and in the seemingly opposing phenomenon of the spontaneous emergence of complex structure.</p>\n<p>SMP Version 1.0 was ready in mid-1981. And that fall, as a way to focus my efforts, I taught a “Topics in Theoretical Physics” course at Caltech (supposedly for graduate students but actually almost as many professors came too) on what, for want of a better name, I called “non-equilibrium statistical mechanics”. My notes for the first lecture dived right in:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img17.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img17.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='530' height='733'></a></p>\n<p>Echoing what I’d seen on that book cover back in 1972 I talked about the example of the expansion of a gas, noting that even in this case “Many features [are] still far from understood”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img18.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='138'></a></p>\n<p>I talked about the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>Boltzmann transport equation</a> and its elaboration in the BBGKY hierarchy, and explored what might be needed to extend it to things like self-gravitating systems. And then—in what must have been a very overstuffed first lecture—I launched into a discussion of “Possible origins of irreversibility”. I began by talking about things like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-ergodicity'>ergodicity</a>, but soon made it clear that this didn’t go the distance, and there was much more to understand—saying that “with a bit of luck” the material in my later lectures might help:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img19.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='115'></a></p>\n<p>I continued by noting that some systems can “develop order and considerable organization”—which non-equilibrium statistical mechanics should be able to explain:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img20.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='158'></a></p>\n<p>I then went quite “cosmological”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img21.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='112'></a></p>\n<p>The first candidate explanation I listed was the fluctuation argument Feynman had tried to use:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img22.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='148'></a></p>\n<p>I discussed the possibility of fundamental microscopic irreversibility—say associated with time-reversal violation in gravity—but largely dismissed this. I talked about the possibility that the universe could have started in a special state in which “the matter is in thermal equilibrium, but the gravitational field is not.” And finally I gave what the 22-year-old me thought at the time was the most plausible explanation:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img23.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img23.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='145'></a></p>\n<p>All of this was in a sense rooted in a traditional mathematical physics style of thinking. But the second lecture gave a hint of a quite different approach:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img24.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img24.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='107'></a></p>\n<p>In my first lecture, I had summarized my plans for subsequent lectures:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img25.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img25.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='124'></a></p>\n<p>But discovery intervened. People had discussed <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-7--reaction-diffusion-processes/'>reaction-diffusion patterns</a> as examples of structure being formed “away from equilibrium”. But I was interested in more dramatic examples, like galaxies, or snowflakes, or turbulent flow patterns, or forms of biological organisms. What kinds of models could realistically be made for these? I started from neural networks, self-gravitating gases and spin systems, and just kept on simplifying and simplifying. It was rather like language design, of the kind I’d done for SMP. What were the simplest primitives from which I could build up what I wanted?</p>\n<p>Before long I came up with what I’d soon learn <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--my-work-on-cellular-automata/'>could be called one-dimensional cellular automata</a>. And immediately I started running them on a computer to see what they did:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img26.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img26.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='473' height='512'></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, they were “organizing themselves”—even from random initial conditions—to make all sorts of structures.

And a footnote in my paper even records the fact these can generate nested patterns with a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-2--properties-of-second-order-cellular-automata-2/'>certain fractal dimension</a>—as computed in a charmingly manual way on a couple of pages I now find in my archives:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img31.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img31.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='608' height='392'></a></p>\n<p>But somehow I hadn’t quite freed myself from the assumption that microscopic irreversibility was what was “causing” structures to be formed. And this was related to another important—and ultimately incorrect—assumption: that all the structure I was seeing was somehow the result of the “filtering” random initial conditions.

And, yes, a quarter century before <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graph.html'>Graph</a></tt> in Wolfram Language, laying out complicated finite state machines wasn’t easy:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img44.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img44.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='448'></a></p>\n<p>But by November 1983 I was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computation-theory-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>writing about</a> “self-organization as a computational process”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img45.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img45.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='570' height='414'></a></p>\n<p>The introduction to my paper again led with the Second Law, though now talked about the idea that computation theory might be what could characterize non-equilibrium and self-organizing phenomena:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img46.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img46.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='240'></a></p>\n<p>The concept of equilibrium in statistical mechanics makes it natural to ask what will happen in a system after an infinite time. But computation theory tells one that the answer to that question can be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-8--undecidability-and-intractability'>non-computable or undecidable</a>. I talked about this in <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computation-theory-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>my paper</a>, but then ended by discussing the ultimately much richer finite case, and suggesting (with a reference to NP completeness) that it might be common for there to be no computational shortcut to cellular automaton evolution. And rather presciently, I made the statement that “One may speculate that [this phenomenon] is widespread in physical systems” so that “the consequences of their evolution could not be predicted, but could effectively be found only by direct simulation or observation.”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img47.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img47.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='178'></a></p>\n<p>These were the beginnings of powerful ideas, but I was still tying them to somewhat technical things like ensembles of all possible states. But in early 1984, that began to change. In January I’d been asked to write an article for the then-top popular science magazine <em><a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1984/09-01/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Scientific American</a></em> on the subject of “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computer-software-science-mathematics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Computers in Science and Mathematics</a>”. I wrote about the general idea of computer experiments and simulation. I wrote about SMP. I wrote about cellular automata. But then I wanted to bring it all together. And that was when I came up with the term “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-6--history-of-computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>”.</p>\n<p>By May 26, the concept was pretty clearly laid out in my draft text:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img48.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img48.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='804'></a></p>\n<p>But just a few days later something big happened. On June 1 I left Princeton for a trip to Europe. And in order to “have something interesting to look at on the plane” I decided to print out pictures of some cellular automata I hadn’t bothered to look at much before. The first one was rule 30:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img49.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img49.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='500' height='269'></a></p>\n<p>And it was then that it all clicked. The complexity I’d been seeing in cellular automata wasn’t the result of some kind of “self-organization” or “filtering” of random initial conditions. Instead, here was an example where it was very obviously being “generated intrinsically” just by the process of evolution of the cellular automaton. This was <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> up close. No need to think about ensembles of states or statistical mechanics. No need to think about elaborate programming of a universal computer. From just a single black cell rule 30 <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p29--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>could produce immense complexity</a>, and showed what seemed very likely to be clear computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>Why hadn’t I figured out before that something like this could happen? After all, I’d even generated a small picture of rule 30 more than two years earlier. But at the time I didn’t have a conceptual framework that made me pay attention to it. And a small picture like that just didn’t have the same in-your-face “complexity from nothing” character as my larger picture of rule 30.</p>\n<p>Of course, as is typical in the history of ideas, there’s more to the story. One of the key things that had originally let me start “scientifically investigating” cellular automata is that out of all the infinite number of possible constructible rules, I’d picked a modest number on which I could do exhaustive experiments. I’d started by considering only <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p55--more-cellular-automata/'>&#8220;elementary&#8221; cellular automata</a>, in one dimension, with <em>k</em> = 2 colors, and with rules of range <em>r</em> = 1. There are 256 such “elementary rules”. But many of them had what seemed to me “distracting” features—like backgrounds alternating between black and white on successive steps, or patterns that systematically shifted to the left or right. And to get rid of these “distractions” I decided to focus on what I (somewhat foolishly in retrospect) <a href='https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>called &#8220;legal rules&#8221;</a>: the 32 rules that leave blank states blank, and are left-right symmetric.</p>\n<p>When one uses random initial conditions, the legal rules do seem—at least in small pictures—to capture the most obvious behaviors one sees across all the elementary rules. But it turns out that’s not true when one looks at simple initial conditions. Among the “legal” rules, the most complicated behavior one sees with simple initial conditions is nesting.</p>\n<p>But even though I concentrated on “legal” rules, I still included in my <a href='https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>first major paper on cellular automata</a> pictures of a few “illegal” rules starting from simple initial conditions—including rule 30. And what’s more, in a section entitled “Extensions”, I discussed cellular automata with more than 2 colors, and showed—though without comment—the pictures:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf#page=35\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img52.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img52.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='594' height='211'></a></p>\n<p>These were low-resolution pictures, and I think I imagined that if one ran them further, the behavior would somehow resolve into something simple. But by early 1983, I had some clues that this wouldn’t happen. Because by then I was generating fairly high-resolution pictures—including ones of the <em>k</em> = 2, <em>r</em> = 2 totalistic rule with code 10 starting from a simple initial condition:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img55.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img55.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='400' height='757'></a></p>\n<p>In early drafts of my 1983 paper on “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Universality and Complexity in Cellular Automata</a>” I noted the generation of “irregularity”, and speculated that it might be associated with class 4 behavior. But later I just stated as an observation without “cause” that some rules—like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--code-10/'>code 10</a>—generate “irregular patterns”. I elaborated a little, but in a very “statistical mechanics” kind of way, not getting the main point:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img56.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img56.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='340' height='320'></a></p>\n<p>In September 1983 I did a little better:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img57.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img57.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='120'></a></p>\n<p>But in the end it wasn’t until June 1, 1984, that I really grokked what was going on.

And from June 15 there’s a <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/1985/T9/035/pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>transcript of a discussion session</a> where I bring up the never-before-mentioned-in-public concept of computational irreducibility—and, unsurprisingly, leave the other participants (who were basically all traditional mathematically oriented physicists) at best slightly bemused:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img59.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img59.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='406' height='392'></a></p>\n<p>I think I was still a bit prejudiced against rule 30 and code 10 as specific rules: I didn’t like the asymmetry of rule 30, and I didn’t like the rapid growth of code 10. (<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p59--more-cellular-automata/'>Rule 73</a>—while symmetric—I also didn’t like because of its alternating background.) But having now grokked the rule 30 phenomenon I knew it also happened in “more aesthetic” “legal” rules with more than 2 colors. And while even 3 colors led to a rather large total space of rules, it was easy to generate examples of the phenomenon there.</p>\n<p>A few days later I was back in the US, working on finishing my article for <em>Scientific American</em>.

In July I finished “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/problems-theory-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Twenty Problems in the Theory of Cellular Automata</a>” for the proceedings of the Swedish conference, including what would become a rather standard kind of picture:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img64.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img64.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='288' height='230'></a></p>\n<p>Problem 15 talks specifically about rule 30, and already asks exactly what would—35 years later—become <a href='https://rule30prize.org/'>Problem #2</a> in my <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>2019 Rule 30 Prizes</a></p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img65.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img65.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='658' height='172'></a></p>\n<p>while Problem 18 asks the (still largely unresolved) question of what the ultimate frequency of computational irreducibility is:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img66.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img66.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='658' height='172'></a></p>\n<p>Very late in putting together the <em>Scientific American</em> article I’d added to the caption of the picture showing rule-30-like behavior the statement “Complex patterns generated by cellular automata can also serve as a source of effectively random numbers, and they can be applied to encrypt messages by converting a text into an apparently random form.” I’d realized both that cellular automata could act as good random generators (we <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SeedRandom.html'>used rule 30 as the default</a> in <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RandomInteger.html'>Wolfram Language</a> for more than 25 years), and that their evolution could effectively encrypt things, much as I’d later describe the Second Law as being about “encrypting” initial conditions to produce effective irreversibility.</p>\n<p>Back in 1984 it was a surprising claim that something as simple and “science-oriented” as a cellular automaton could be useful for encryption. Because at the time <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-10--history-of-cryptography/'>practical encryption</a> was basically always done by what at least seemed like arbitrary and complicated engineering solutions, whose security relied on details or explanations that were often considered military or commercial secrets.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure when I first became aware of cryptography. But back in 1973 when I first had access to a computer there were a couple of kids (as well as a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/08/a-book-from-alan-turing-and-a-mysterious-piece-of-paper/'>teacher who&#8217;d been a friend of Alan Turing&#8217;s</a>) who were programming Enigma-like encryption systems (perhaps fueled by what were then still officially just rumors of World War II goings-on at Bletchley Park). And by 1980 I knew enough about encryption that I made a point of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>encrypting the source code of SMP</a> (using a modified version of the Unix crypt program). (As it happens, we lost the password, and it was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2016/04/smp-on-vax-emulator.png' target=_blank rel=noopener>only in 2015 that we got access</a> to the source again.)</p>\n<p>My archives record a curious interaction about encryption in May 1982—right around when I’d first run (though didn’t appreciate) rule 30. A rather colorful physicist I knew named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brosl_Hasslacher' target=_blank rel=noopener>Brosl Hasslacher</a> (who we’ll encounter again later) was trying to start a curiously modern-sounding company named Quantum Encryption Devices (or QED for short)—that was actually trying to market a quite hacky and definitively classical (multiple-shift-register-based) encryption system, ultimately to some rather shady customers (and, yes, the “expected” funding did not materialize):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img67.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img67.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='496' height='480'></a></p>\n<p>But it was 1984 before I made a connection between encryption and cellular automata. And the first thing I imagined was giving input as the initial condition of the cellular automaton, then running the cellular automaton rule to produce “encrypted output”. The most straightforward way to make encryption was then to have the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-2--the-notion-of-reversibility'>cellular automaton rule be reversible</a>, and to run the inverse rule to do the decryption. I’d already done a little bit of investigation of reversible rules, but this led to a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-2--numbers-of-reversible-cellular-automaton-rules/'>big search for reversible rules</a>—which would later come in handy for thinking about microscopically reversible processes and thermodynamics.</p>\n<p>Just down the hall from me at the Institute for Advanced Study was a distinguished mathematician named <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Milnor/' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Milnor</a>, who got very interested in what I was doing with cellular automata. My archives contain all sorts of notes from Jack, like:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img68.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img68.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='420'></a></p>\n<p>There’s even a reversible (“one-to-one”) rule, with nice, minimal BASIC code, along with lots of “real math”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img69.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img69.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='396'></a></p>\n<p>But by the spring of 1984 Jack and I were talking a lot about encryption in cellular automata—and we even began to draft a paper about it</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img70.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img70.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='494' height='411'></a></p>\n<p>complete with outlines of how encryption schemes could work:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img71.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img71.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='511' height='350'></a></p>\n<p>The core of our approach involved reversible rules, and so we did all sorts of searches to find these (and by 1984 Jack was—like me—writing C code):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img72.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img72.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='641' height='268'></a></p>\n<p>I wondered how random the output from cellular automata was, and I asked people I knew at Bell Labs about randomness testing (and, yes, email headers haven’t changed much in four decades, though then I was swolf@ias.uucp; research!ken was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ken Thompson</a> of Unix fame):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img73.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img73.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='514' height='260'></a></p>\n<p>But then came my internalization of the rule 30 phenomenon, which led to a rather different way of thinking about encryption with cellular automata. Before, we’d basically been assuming that the cellular automaton rule was the encryption key. But rule 30 suggested one could instead have a fixed rule, and have the initial condition define the key. And this is what led me to more physics-oriented thinking about cryptography—and to what I said in <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>\n<p>In July I was making “encryption-friendly” pictures of rule 30:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img74.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img74.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='508' height='428'></a></p>\n<p>But what Jack and I were most interested in was doing something more “cryptographically sophisticated”, and in particular inventing a practical public-key cryptosystem based on cellular automata. Pretty much the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-10--rsa-cryptography/'>only public-key cryptosystems known</a> then (or even now) are based on number theory. But we thought maybe one could use something like products of rules instead of products of numbers. Or maybe one didn’t need exact invertibility. Or something. But by the late summer of 1984, things weren’t looking good:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img75.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img75.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='377'></a></p>\n<p>And eventually we decided we just couldn’t figure it out. And it’s basically still not been figured out (and maybe it’s actually impossible). But even though we don’t know how to make a public-key cryptosystem with cellular automata, the whole idea of encrypting initial data and turning it into effective randomness is a crucial part of the whole story of the computational foundations of thermodynamics as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>I think I now understand them</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='where-does-randomness-come-from?'>Where Does Randomness Come From?</h2>\n<p>Right from when I first formulated it, I thought computational irreducibility was an important idea.

And my notes—perhaps from a little later—make it clear that actually I was thinking about the Second Law along pretty much the same lines as I do now, except that back then I didn’t yet understand the fundamental significance of the observer:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img81.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img81.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='630' height='714'></a></p>\n<p>And spelunking now in my old filesystem (retrieved from a 9-track backup tape) I find from November 17, 1984 (at 2:42am), <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff' target=_blank rel=noopener>troff</a> source for a putative paper (which, yes, we even now can run through troff):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img82.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img82.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='314'></a></p>\n<p>This is all that’s in my filesystem. So, yes, in effect, I’m finally (more or less) finishing this 38 years later.</p>\n<p>But in 1984 one of the hot—if not new—ideas of the time was “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-4--history-of-chaos-theory/'>chaos theory</a>”, which talked about how &#8220;randomness&#8221; could &#8220;deterministically arise&#8221; from progressive &#8220;excavation&#8221; of higher and higher-order digits in the initial conditions for a system. But having seen rule 30 this whole phenomenon of what was often (misleadingly) called “deterministic chaos” seemed to me at best like a sideshow—and definitely not the main effect leading to most randomness seen in physical systems.</p>\n<p>I began to draft a paper about this</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img83.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img83.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='468'></a></p>\n<p>including for the first time an anchor picture of rule 30 intrinsically generating randomness—to be contrasted with pictures of randomness being generated (still in cellular automata) from sensitive dependence on random initial conditions:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img84.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img84.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='469' height='530'></a></p>\n<p>It was a bit of a challenge to find an appropriate publishing venue for what amounted to a rather “interdisciplinary” piece of physics-meets-math-meets-computation. But <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/\" target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Physical Review Letters</em></a> seemed like the best bet, so on November 19, 1984, I submitted a version of the paper there, shortened to fit in its 4-page limit.</p>\n<p>A couple of months later the journal said it was having trouble finding appropriate reviewers. I revised the paper a bit (in retrospect I think not improving it), then on February 1, 1985, sent it in again, with the new title “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/origins-randomness-physical-systems.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Origins of Randomness in Physical Systems</a>”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img85.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img85.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='450'></a></p>\n<p>On March 8 the journal responded, with two reports from reviewers. One of the reviewers completely missed the point (yes, a risk in writing shift-the-paradigm papers). The other sent a very constructive two-page report:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img86.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img86.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='666'></a></p>\n<p>I didn’t know it then, but later I found out that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraichnan' target=_blank rel=noopener>Bob Kraichnan</a> had spent much of his life working on fluid turbulence (as well as that he was a very independent and think-for-oneself physicist who’d been one of Einstein’s last assistants at the Institute for Advanced Study). Looking at his report now it’s a little charming to see his statement that “no one who has looked much at turbulent flows can easily doubt [that they intrinsically generate randomness]” (as opposed to getting randomness from noise, initial conditions, etc.). Even decades later, very few people seem to understand this.</p>\n<p>There were several exchanges with the journal, leaving it controversial whether they would publish the paper. But then in May I visited Los Alamos, and Bob Kraichnan invited me to lunch. He’d also invited a then-young physicist from Los Alamos who I’d known fairly well a few years earlier—and who’d once paid me the unintended compliment that it wasn’t fair for me to work on science because I was “too efficient”. (He told me he’d “intended to work on cellular automata”, but before he’d gotten around to it, I’d basically figured everything out.) Now he was riding the chaos theory bandwagon hard, and insofar as my paper threatened that, he wanted to do anything he could to kill the paper.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t seen this kind of “paradigm attack” before. Back when I’d been <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/particle-physics'>doing particle physics</a>, it had been a hot and cutthroat area, and I’d had papers plagiarized, sometimes even egregiously. But there wasn’t really any “paradigm divergence”. And cellular automata—being quite far from the fray—were something I could just peacefully work on, without anyone really paying much attention to whatever paradigm I might be developing.</p>\n<p>At lunch I was treated to a lecture about why what I was doing was nonsense, or even if it wasn’t, I shouldn’t talk about it, at least now. Eventually I got a chance to respond, I thought rather effectively—causing my “opponent” to leave in a huff, with the parting line “If you publish the paper, I’ll ruin your career”. It was a strange thing to say, given that in the pecking order of physics, he was quite junior to me. (A decade and half later there were nevertheless a couple of “incidents”.) Bob Kraichnan turned to me, cracked a wry smile and said “OK, I’ll go right now and tell [the journal] to <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/origins-randomness-physical-systems.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>publish your paper</a>”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img87.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img87.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='244'></a></p>\n<p>Kraichnan was quite right that the paper was much too short for what it was trying to say, and in the end it took a long book—namely <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>—to explain things more clearly. But the paper was where a high-resolution picture of rule 30 first appeared in print. And it was the place where I first tried to explain the distinction between “randomness that’s just transcribed from elsewhere” and the fundamental phenomenon one sees in rule 30 where randomness is intrinsically generated by computational processes within a system.</p>\n<p>I wanted words to describe these two different cases. And reaching back to my years of learning ancient Greek in school I invented the terms “homoplectic” and “autoplectic”, with the noun “autoplectism” to describe what rule 30 does. In retrospect, I think these terms are perhaps “too Greek” (or too “medical sounding”), and I’ve tended to just talk about “intrinsic randomness generation” instead of autoplectism. (Originally, I’d wanted to avoid the term “intrinsic” to prevent confusion with randomness that’s baked into the rules of a system.)</p>\n<p>The paper (as Bob Kraichnan pointed out) talks about many things. And at the end, having talked about fluid turbulence, there’s a final sentence—about the Second Law:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img88.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img88.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='419'></a></p>\n<p>In my archives, I find other mentions of the Second Law too.

But being quite involved in the computer industry, I couldn’t help wondering whether they might be directly useful for practical computation. And I talked about the possibility of building a “metachip” in which—instead of having predefined “meaningful” opcodes like in an ordinary microprocessor—everything would be built up “purely in software” from an underlying universal cellular automaton rule. And various people and companies started sending me <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1168506' target=_blank rel=noopener>possible designs</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1168506\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img91a.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img91a.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='481' height=''></a></p>\n<p>But in 1984 I got involved in being a consultant to an MIT-spinoff startup called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines_Corporation' target=_blank rel=noopener>Thinking Machines Corporation</a> that was trying to build a massively parallel “Connection Machine” computer with 65536 processors. The company had aspirations around AI (hence the name, which I’d actually been involved in suggesting), but their machine could also be put to work simulating cellular automata, like rule 30. In June 1985, hot off my work on the origins of randomness, I went to spend some of the summer at Thinking Machines, and decided it was time to do whatever analysis—or, as I would call it now, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>—I could on rule 30.</p>\n<p>My filesystem from 1985 records that it was fast work.

But that wasn’t going to work well for the Connection Machine. Because in optimizing for parallelism, its individual processors were quite simple, and weren’t set up to do fast (e.g. floating-point) numerical computation.</p>\n<p>I’d been saying for years that cellular automata should be relevant to fluid turbulence. And my recent study of the origins of randomness made me all the more convinced that they would for example be able to capture the fundamental randomness associated with turbulence (which I explained as being a bit like encryption):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/ScientificComputationWithTheConnectionMachine.pdf#page=2\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img100.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img100.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='552' height='185'></a></p>\n<p>I sent a letter to Feynman expressing my enthusiasm:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img101.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img101.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='435' height='297'></a></p>\n<p>I had been invited to a conference in Japan that summer on “High Reynolds Number Flow Computation” (i.e. computing turbulent fluid flow), and on May 4 I sent an abstract which explained a little more of my approach:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:19037938\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img102.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img102.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='367'></a></p>\n<p>My basic idea was to start not from continuum equations, but instead from a cellular automaton idealization of molecular dynamics. It was the same kind of underlying model as I’d tried to set up in my SPART program in 1973. But now instead of using it to study thermodynamic phenomena and the microscopic motions associated with heat, my idea was to use it to study the kind of visible motion that occurs in fluid dynamics—and in particular to see whether it could explain the apparent randomness of fluid turbulence.</p>\n<p>I knew from the beginning that I needed to rely on “Second Law behavior” in the underlying cellular automaton—because that’s what would lead to the randomness necessary to “wash out” the simple idealizations I was using in the cellular automaton, and allow standard continuum fluid behavior to emerge. And so it was that I embarked on the project of understanding not only thermodynamics, but also hydrodynamics and fluid turbulence, with cellular automata—on the Connection Machine.</p>\n<p>I’ve had the experience many times in my life of entering a field and bringing in new tools and new ideas. Back in 1985 I’d already done that several times, and it had always been a pretty much uniformly positive experience. But, sadly, with fluid turbulence, it was to be, at best, a turbulent experience.</p>\n<p>The idea that cellular automata might be useful in studying fluid turbulence definitely wasn’t obvious. The year before, for example, at the Nobel Symposium conference in Sweden, a French physicist named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel_Frisch' target=_blank rel=noopener>Uriel Frisch</a> had been summarizing the state of turbulence research. Fittingly for the topic of turbulence, he and I first met after a rather bumpy helicopter ride to a conference event—where Frisch told me in no uncertain terms that cellular automata would never be relevant to turbulence, and talked about how turbulence was better thought of as being associated (a bit like in the mathematical theory of phase transitions) with “singularities getting close to the real line”. (Strangely, I just now looked at Frisch’s paper in the <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/1985/T9/023/pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>proceedings of the conference</a>: “Ou en est la Turbulence Developpée?” [roughly: “Fully Developed Turbulence: Where Do We Stand?”], and was surprised to discover that its last paragraph actually mentions cellular automata, and its acknowledgements thank me for conversations—even though the paper says it was received June 11, 1984, a couple of days before I had met Frisch. And, yes, this is the kind of thing that makes accurately reconstructing history hard.)</p>\n<p>Los Alamos had always been a hotbed of computational fluid dynamics (not least because of its importance in simulating nuclear explosions)—and in fact of computing in general—and, starting in the late fall of 1984, on my visits there I talked to many people about using cellular automata to do fluid dynamics on the Connection Machine. Meanwhile, Brosl Hasslacher (mentioned above in connection with his 1982 encryption startup) had—after a rather itinerant career as a physicist—landed at Los Alamos. And in fact I had been asked by the Los Alamos management for a letter about him in December 1984 (yes, even though he was 18 years older than me), and ended what I wrote with: “He has considerable ability in identifying promising areas of research. I think he would be a significant addition to the staff at Los Alamos.”</p>\n<p>Well, in early 1985 Brosl identified cellular automaton fluid dynamics as a promising area, and started energetically talking to me about it. Meanwhile, the Connection Machine was just starting to work, and a young software engineer named Jim Salem was assigned to help me get cellular automaton fluid dynamics running on it. I didn’t know it at the time, but Brosl—ever the opportunist—had also made contact with Uriel Frisch, and now I find the curious document in French dated May 10, 1985, with the translated title “A New Concept for Supercomputers: Cellular Automata”, laying out a grand international multiyear plan, and referencing the (so far as I know, nonexistent) B. Hasslacher and U. Frisch (1985), “The Cellular Automaton Turbulence Machine”, Los Alamos:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img103.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img103.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='257'></a></p>\n<p>I visited Los Alamos again in May, but for much of the summer I was at Thinking Machines, and on July 18 Uriel Frisch came to visit there, along with a French physicist named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Pomeau' target=_blank rel=noopener>Yves Pomeau</a>, who had done some nice work in the 1970s on applying methods of traditional statistical mechanics to “lattice gases”.</p>\n<p>But what about realistic fluid dynamics, and turbulence? I wasn’t sure how easy it would be to “build up from the (idealized) molecules” to get to pictures of recognizable fluid flows. But we were starting to have some success in generating at least basic results. It wasn’t clear how seriously anyone else was taking this (especially given that at the time I hadn’t seen the material Frisch had already written), but insofar as anything was “going on”, it seemed to be a perfectly collegial interaction—where perhaps Los Alamos or the French government or both would buy a Connection Machine computer. But meanwhile, on the technical side, it had become clear that the most obvious square-lattice model (that Pomeau had used in the 1970s, and that was basically what my SPART program from 1973 was supposed to implement) was fine for diffusion processes, but couldn’t really represent proper fluid flow.</p>\n<p>When I first started working on cellular automata in 1981 the minimal 1D case in which I was most interested had barely been studied, but there had been quite a bit of work done in previous decades on the 2D case. By the 1980s, however, it had mostly petered out—with the exception of a group at MIT led by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fredkin' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ed Fredkin</a>, who had long had the belief that one might in effect be able to &#8220;construct all of physics&#8221; using cellular automata. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommaso_Toffoli' target=_blank rel=noopener>Tom Toffoli</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Margolus' target=_blank rel=noopener>Norm Margolus</a>, who were working with him, had built a hardware 2D cellular automaton simulator—that I happened to photograph in 1982 when visiting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_Island' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fredkin&#8217;s island in the Caribbean</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img104.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img104.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='260' height='392'></a></p>\n<p>But while “all of physics” was elusive (and our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> suggests that a cellular automaton with a rigid lattice is not the right place to start), there’d been success in making for example an idealized gas, using essentially a block cellular automaton on a square grid. But mostly the cellular automaton machine was used in a maddeningly “Look at this cool thing!” mode, often accompanied by rapid physical rewiring.</p>\n<p>In early 1984 I visited MIT to use the machine to try to do what amounted to natural science, systematically studying 2D cellular automata. The <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/two-dimensional-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>result was a paper</a> (with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Packard' target=_blank rel=noopener>Norman Packard</a>) on 2D cellular automata. We restricted ourselves to square grids, though mentioned hexagonal ones, and <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computer-software-science-mathematics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>my article in <em>Scientific American</em> in late 1984</a> opened with a full-page hexagonal cellular automaton simulation of a snowflake made by Packard (and later in 1984 turned into one of a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/' target=_blank rel=noopener>set of cellular automaton cards</a> for sale):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img105.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img105.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='400' height='284'></a></p>\n<p>In any case, in the summer of 1985, with square lattices not doing what was needed, it was time to try hexagonal ones. I think Yves Pomeau already had a theoretical argument for this, but as far as I was concerned, it was (at least at first) just a &#8220;next thing to try”. Programming the Connection Machine was at that time a rather laborious process (which, almost unprecedentedly for me, I wasn&#8217;t doing myself), and mapping a hexagonal grid onto its basically square architecture was a little fiddly, as my notes record:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"

famous for taking down a well-known hacker) to Brosl Hasslacher, and now Tsutomu jumped into writing optimized code to implement hexagonal cellular automata on a Cray supercomputer.</p>\n<p>In my archives I now find a draft paper from September 7 that starts with a nice (if not entirely correct) discussion of what amounts to computational irreducibility, and then continues by giving theoretical symmetry-based arguments that a hexagonal cellular automaton should be able to reproduce fluid mechanics:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"

as everyone else) were starting to get results that looked at least suggestive:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"

thought, graciously) thanked Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau and Shimomura for “discussions and for sharing their unpublished results with us”, which by that point included a bunch of suggestive, if not obviously correct, pictures of fluid-flow-like behavior.</p>\n<p>To me, what was important about our paper is that, after all these years, it filled in with more detail just how computational systems like cellular automata could lead to Second-Law-style thermodynamic behavior, and it “proved” the physicality of what was going on by showing easy-to-recognize fluid-dynamics-like behavior.</p>\n<p>Just four days later, though, there was a big surprise. <em>The Washington Post</em> ran a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/11/19/discovery-in-flow-dynamics-may-aid-car-plane-design/bdcf5b8b-dee0-4582-8180-8d792a2ab24d/' target=_blank rel=noopener>front-page story</a>—alongside the day’s characteristic-Cold-War-era geopolitical news—about the “Hasslacher–Frisch model”, and about how it might be judged so important that it “should be classified to keep it out of Soviet hands”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img113.png\"><img loading='lazy'

went crazy. There was talk of Nobel Prizes (I wasn’t buying it). There were official complaints from the French embassy about French scientists not being adequately recognized. There was upset at Thinking Machines for not even being mentioned. And, yes, as the originator of the idea, I was miffed that nobody seemed to have even suggested contacting me—even if I did view the rather breathless and “geopolitical” tenor of the article as being pretty far from immediate reality.</p>\n<p>At the time, everyone involved denied having been responsible for the appearance of the article. But years later it emerged that the source was a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gage' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Gage</a>, former political operative and longtime marketing operative at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sun Microsystems</a>, who I’d known since 1982, and had at some point introduced to Brosl Hasslacher. Apparently he’d called around various government contacts to help encourage open (international) sharing of scientific code, quoting this as a test case.</p>\n<p>But as it was, the article had pretty much exactly the opposite effect, with everyone now out for themselves. In Princeton, I’d interacted with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Orszag' target=_blank rel=noopener>Steve Orszag</a>, whose funding for his new (traditional) computational fluid dynamics company, Nektonics, now seemed at risk, and who pulled me into an emergency effort to prove that cellular automaton fluid dynamics couldn’t be competitive. (<a href='https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.1691' target=_blank rel=noopener>The paper</a> he wrote about this seemed interesting, but I demurred on being a coauthor.) Meanwhile, Thinking Machines wanted to <a href='https://patents.justia.com/patent/4691291' target=_blank rel=noopener>file a patent</a> as quickly as possible. Any possibility of the French government getting a Connection Machine evaporated and soon Brosl Hasslacher was claiming that “the French are faking their data”.</p>\n<p>And then there was the matter of the various academic papers. I had been sent the Frisch–Hasslacher–Pomeau paper to review, and checking my 1985 calendar for my whereabouts I must have received it the very day I finished my paper. I told the journal they should publish the paper, suggesting some changes to avoid naivete about computing and computer technology, but not mentioning its very thin recognition of my work.</p>\n<p>Our paper, on the other hand, triggered a rather indecorous competitive response, with two “anonymous reviewers” claiming that the paper said nothing more than its “reference 5” (the Frisch–Hasslacher–Pomeau paper). I patiently pointed out that that wasn’t the case, not least because our paper had actual simulations, but also that actually I happened to have “been there first” with the overall idea. The journal solicited other opinions, which were mostly supportive. But in the end a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kadanoff' target=_blank rel=noopener>Leo Kadanoff</a> swooped in to block it, only to publish his own a few months later.</p>\n<p>It felt corrupt, and distasteful. I was at that point a successful and increasingly established academic. And some of the people involved were even longtime friends. So was this kind of thing what I had to look forward to in a life in academia? That didn’t seem attractive, or necessary. And it was what began the process that led me, a year and a half later, to finally choose to leave academia behind, never to return.</p>\n<p>Still, despite the “turbulence”—and in the midst of other activities—I continued to work hard on cellular automaton fluids, and by January 1986 I had the first version of a long (and, I thought, rather good) <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>paper on their basic theory</a> (that was finished and published later that year):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img114.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img114.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='526' height='493'></a></p>\n<p>As it turns out, the methods I used in that paper provide some important seeds for our Physics Project, and even in recent times I’ve often found myself referring to the paper, complete with its SMP open-code appendix:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf#page=53\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img115.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img115.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='320'></a></p>\n<p>But in addition to developing the theory, I was also getting simulations done on the Connection Machine, and getting actual experimental data (particularly on flow past cylinders) to compare them to. By February 1986, we had quite a few results:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img116.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img116.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='670'></a></p>\n<p>But by this point there was a quite industrial effort, particularly in France, that was churning out papers on cellular automaton fluids at a high rate. I’d called my theory paper “Cellular Automaton Fluid 1: Basic Theory”. But was it really worth finishing part 2? There was a veritable army of perfectly good physicists “competing” with me. And, I thought, “I have other things to do. Just let them do this. This doesn’t need me”.</p>\n<p>And so it was that in the middle of 1986 I stopped working on cellular automaton fluids. And, yes, that freed me up to work on lots of other interesting things. But even though methods derived from cellular automaton fluids have become widely used in practical fluid dynamics computations, the key basic science that I thought could be addressed with cellular automaton fluids—about things like the origin of randomness in turbulence—has still, even to this day, not really been further explored.</p>\n<h2 id='getting-to-the-continuum'>Getting to the Continuum</h2>\n<p>In June 1986 I was about to launch both a research center (the <a href='https://www.complexityexplorer.org/explore/resources/16-center-for-complex-systems-research' target=_blank rel=noopener>Center for Complex Systems Research</a> at the University of Illinois) and a journal (<em><a href='https://www.complex-systems.com/'>Complex Systems</a></em>)—and I was also organizing a conference called <a href='http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TM-317.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>CA &#8217;86 (which was held at MIT)</a>. The core of the conference was poster presentations, and a few days before the conference was to start I decided I should find a “nice little project” that I could quickly turn into a poster.</p>\n<p>In studying cellular automaton fluids I had found that cellular automata with rules based on idealized physical molecular dynamics could on a large scale approximate the continuum behavior of fluids. But what if one just started from continuum behavior? Could one derive underlying rules that would reproduce it? Or perhaps even find the minimal such rules?</p>\n<p>By mid-1985 I felt I’d made decent progress on the science of cellular automata. But what about their engineering? What about constructing cellular automata with particular behavior? In May 1985 I had given a conference talk about “Cellular Automaton Engineering”, which turned into a paper about “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/approaches-complexity-engineering.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Approaches to Complexity Engineering</a>”—that in effect tried to set up “trainable cellular automata” in what might still be a powerful simple-programs-meet-machine-learning scheme that deserves to be explored:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img117.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img117.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='366'></a></p>\n<p>But so it was that a few days before the CA ’86 conference I decided to try to find a minimal “cellular automaton approximation” to a simple continuum process: diffusion in one dimension.</p>\n<p>I explained</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-continuum-systems.pdf\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img118.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img118.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='571' height='334'></a></p>\n<p>and described as my objective:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-continuum-systems.pdf#page=3\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img119.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img119.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='571' height='252'></a></p>\n<p>I used block cellular automata, and tried to find rules that were reversible and also conserved something that could serve as “microscopic density” or “particle number”.

But in 1991 I started to use the technology I now had, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>began the project that became <em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Much of the first couple of years was spent exploring the computational universe of simple programs, and discovering that the phenomena I’d discovered in cellular automata were actually much more general. And it was seeing that generality that led me to the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. In formulating the concept of computational irreducibility I’d in effect been thinking about trying to “reduce” the behavior of systems using an external as-powerful-as-possible universal computer. But now I’d realized I should just be thinking about all systems as somehow computationally equivalent. And in doing that I was pulling the conception of the “observer” and their computational ability closer to the systems they were observing.</p>\n<p>But the further development of that idea would have to wait nearly three more decades, until the arrival of our Physics Project. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature/'>Chapter 7 on &#8220;Mechanisms in Programs and Nature&#8221;</a> describes the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p315--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness/'>intrinsic randomness generation</a>, and how it’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-2--three-mechanisms-for-randomness'>distinguished from other sources of randomness</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>Chapter 8 on &#8220;Implications for Everyday Systems&#8221;</a> then has a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-4--fluid-flow'>section on fluid flow</a>, where I describe the idea that randomness in turbulence could be intrinsically generated, making it, for example, repeatable, rather than inevitably different every time an experiment is run.</p>\n<p>And then there’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>Chapter 9, entitled &#8220;Fundamental Physics&#8221;</a>. The majority of the chapter—and its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#maybe-it-could-apply-to-physics'>&#8220;most famous&#8221; part</a>—is the presentation of the direct precursor to our Physics Project, including the concept of graph-rewriting-based computational models for the lowest-level structure of spacetime and the universe.</p>\n<p>But there’s an <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-3--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>earlier part of Chapter 9</a> as well, and it’s about the Second Law. There’s a precursor about “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-2--the-notion-of-reversibility'>The Notion of Reversibility</a>”, and then we’re on to a section about “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-3--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>Irreversibility and the Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>”, followed by “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-4--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena'>Conserved Quantities and Continuum Phenomena</a>”, which is where the “winning rule” I discovered in 1996 <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p462--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena/'>appears again</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img131.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img131.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='560' height='332'></a></p>\n<p>My records show I wrote all of this—and generated all the pictures—between May 2 and July 11, 1995.

I’ve often said that in studying the computational universe we have to remember that the “computational animals” are at least as smart as we are—and they’re always up to tricks we don’t expect.</p>\n<p>And so it is with rule 37R. In 1986 I’d published a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>book of cellular automaton papers</a>, and as an appendix I’d included lots of <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-properties.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>tables of properties of cellular automata</a>. Almost all the tables were about the ordinary elementary cellular automata.

And with rule 37R I’d found it. And at the time I moved on to other things. (On March 1, 1994, I slipped on some ice and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#photographs-for-the-book'>broke my ankle</a>, and was largely out of action for several weeks.)</p>\n<p>And that takes us back to May 1995, when I was working on writing about the Second Law. My filesystem records that I did quite a few more experiments on rule 37R then, looking at different initial conditions, and running it as long as I could, to see if its strange neither-simple-nor-randomizing—and not very Second-Law-like—behavior would somehow “resolve”.</p>\n<p>Up to that moment, for nearly a quarter of a century, I had always fundamentally believed in the Second Law. Yes, I thought there might be exceptions with things like self-gravitating systems. But I’d always assumed that—perhaps with some pathological exceptions—the Second Law was something quite universal, whose origins I could even now understand through computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>But seeing rule 37R this suddenly didn’t seem right.

But finally in May 2002 it was published. The book talked about many things. And even within Chapter 9 my discussion of the Second Law was overshadowed by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#maybe-it-could-apply-to-physics'>the outline I gave of an approach</a> to finding a truly fundamental theory of physics—and of the ideas that evolved into our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='the-physics-project&mdash;and-the-second-law-again'>The Physics Project&mdash;and the Second Law Again</h2>\n<p>After <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was finished I spent many years working mainly on technology—building <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>, launching the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> and so on. But “follow up on Chapter 9” was always on my longterm to-do list. The biggest—and most difficult—part of that had to do with fundamental physics. But I still had a great intellectual attachment to the Second Law, and I always wanted to use what I’d then understood about the computational paradigm to “tighten up” and “round out” the Second Law.</p>\n<p>I’d mention it to people from time to time. Usually the response was the same: “Wasn’t the Second Law understood a century ago? What more is there to say?” Then I’d explain, and it’d be like “Oh, yes, that is interesting”. But somehow it always seemed like people felt the Second Law was “old news”, and that whatever I might do would just be “dotting an <em>i</em> or crossing a <em>t</em>”. And in the end my Second Law project never quite made it onto my active list, despite the fact that it was something I always wanted to do.</p>\n<p>Occasionally I would write about my ideas for finding a fundamental theory of physics. And, implicitly I’d rely on the understanding I’d developed of the foundations and generalization of the Second Law. In 2015, for example, celebrating the centenary of General Relativity, I wrote about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/what-is-spacetime-really/'>what spacetime might really be like &#8220;underneath&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img144.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img144.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='324' height='328'></a></p>\n<p>and how a perceived spacetime continuum might emerge from discrete underlying structure like fluid behavior emerges from molecular dynamics—in effect through the operation of a generalized Second Law:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img145.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img145.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='324' height='241'></a></p>\n<p>It was 17 years after the publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> that (as I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>described elsewhere</a>) circumstances finally aligned to embark on what became our Physics Project. And after all those years, the idea of computational irreducibility—and its immediate implications for the Second Law—had come to seem so obvious to me (and to the young physicists with whom I worked) that they could just be taken for granted as conceptual building blocks in constructing the tower of ideas we needed.</p>\n<p>One of the surprising and dramatic implications of our Physics Project is that General Relativity and quantum mechanics are in a sense both manifestations of the same fundamental phenomenon—but played out respectively in physical space and in branchial space. But what really is this phenomenon?</p>\n<p>What became clear is that ultimately it’s all about the interplay between underlying computational irreducibility and our nature as observers. It’s a concept that had its origins in my thinking about the Second Law. Because even in 1984 I’d understood that the Second Law is about our inability to “decode” underlying computationally irreducible behavior.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d devoted <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>Chapter 10 to &#8220;Processes of Perception and Analysis&#8221;</a>, and I’d recognized that we should view such processes—like any processes in nature or elsewhere—as being fundamentally computational. But I still thought of processes of perception and analysis as being separated from—and in some sense “outside”—actual processes we might be studying. But in our Physics Project we’re studying the whole universe, so inevitably we as observers are “inside” and part of the system.</p>\n<p>And what then became clear is the emergence of things like General Relativity and quantum mechanics depends on certain characteristics of us as observers. “Alien observers” might perceive quite different laws of physics (or no systematic laws at all). But for “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers like us</a>”, who are computationally bounded and believe we are persistent in time, General Relativity and quantum mechanics are inevitable.</p>\n<p>In a sense, therefore, General Relativity and quantum mechanics become “abstractly derivable” given our nature as observers. And the remarkable thing is that at some level the story is exactly the same with the Second Law. To me it’s a surprising and deeply beautiful scientific unification: that all three of the great foundational theories of physics—General Relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics—are in effect manifestations of the same core phenomenon: an interplay between computational irreducibility and our nature as observers.</p>\n<p>Back in the 1970s I had no inkling of all this. And even when I chose to combine my discussions of the Second Law and of my approach to a fundamental theory of physics into a single chapter of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I didn’t know how deeply these would be connected. It’s been a long and winding path, that’s needed to pass through many different pieces of science and technology. But in the end the feeling I had when I first studied that book cover when I was 12 years old that “this was something fundamental” has played out on a scale almost incomprehensibly beyond what I had ever imagined.</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img146.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img146.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='550' height='360'></a></p>\n<h2 id='discovering-class-4'>Discovering Class 4</h2>\n<p>Most of my journey with the Second Law has had to do with understanding origins of randomness, and their relation to “typical Second-Law behavior”.

Indeed, one of the multiple <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--history-of-cellular-automata/'>ways that cellular automata were invented</a> (and the one that led to their name) was through <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/john-von-neumanns-100th-birthday/'>John von Neumann</a>’s 1952 effort to construct a complicated cellular automaton in which there could be a complicated configuration capable of self-reproduction.</p>\n<p>But could self-reproducing structures ever “occur naturally” in cellular automata? Without the benefit of intuition from things like rule 30, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/john-von-neumanns-100th-birthday/'>von Neumann assumed</a> that something like self-reproduction would need an incredibly complicated setup, as it seems to have, for example, in biology. But having seen rule 30—and more so class 4 cellular automata—it didn’t seem so implausible to me that even with very simple underlying rules, there could be fairly simple configurations that would show phenomena like self-reproduction.</p>\n<p>But for such a configuration to “occur naturally” in a random initial condition might require a system with exponentially many cells. And I wondered if in the oceans of the early Earth there might have been only “just enough” molecules for something like a self-reproducing lifeform to occur.</p>\n<p>Back in 1983 I already had pretty efficient code for searching for structures in class 4 cellular automata. But even running for days at a time, I never found anything more complicated than purely periodic (if sometimes moving) structures. And in March 1985, following an <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/media/computer-recreations/'>article about my work in <em>Scientific American</a></em>, I <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2023/02/glider-gun-guidelines.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>appealed to the public to find &#8220;interesting structures&#8221;</a>—like “glider guns” that would “shoot out” moving structures:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img154.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img154.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='600' height='614'></a></p>\n<p>As it happened, right before I made my “public appeal”, a student at Princeton working with a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Steiglitz' target=_blank rel=noopener>professor I knew</a> had sent me a glider gun he’d found the <em>k</em> = 2, <em>r</em> = 3 totalistic code 88 rule:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img157.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img157.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='178'></a></p>\n<p>At the time, though, with computer displays only large enough to see behavior like</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img158a_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img158.png\" alt='' title='' width='281' height='166'> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>I wasn’t convinced this was an “ordinary class 4 rule”—even though now, with the benefit of higher display resolution, it seems more convincing:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img159a_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img159.png\" alt='' title='' width='333' height='227'> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>The “public appeal” generated a lot of interesting feedback—but no glider guns or other exotic structures in the rules I considered “obviously class 4”. And it wasn’t until after I started working on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> that I got back to the question. But then, on the evening of December 31, 1991, using exactly the same code as in 1983, but now with faster computers, there it was: in an ordinary <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p282--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>class 4 rule (<em>k</em> = 3, <em>r</em> = 1 code 1329)</a>, after finding several localized structures, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p288--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>there was one that grew without bound</a> (albeit not in the most obvious “glider gun” way):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p287--structures-in-class-4-systems\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img162.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img162.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='611' height='365'></a></p>\n<p>But that wasn’t all.

Some years we asked students to pick their “favorite cellular automaton”. Often they were class 4:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img164.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img164.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='587' height='330'></a></p>\n<p>And occasionally someone would do a project to explore the world of some particular class 4 rule. But beyond those specifics—and statements about computation universality—it’s never been clear quite what one could say about class 4.</p>\n<p>Back in 1984 in the <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/' target=_blank rel=noopener>series of cellular automaton postcards</a> I’d produced, there were a couple of class 4 examples:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img165.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img165.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='218'></a></p>\n<p>And even then the typical response to these images was that they looked “organic”—like the kind of thing living organisms might produce. A decade later—for <em>A New Kind of Science</em>—I studied “organic forms” quite a bit, trying to understand how organisms <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-6--growth-of-plants-and-animals'>get their overall shapes</a>, and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-7--biological-pigmentation-patterns'>surface patterns</a>. Mostly that didn’t end up being a story of class 4 behavior, though.</p>\n<p>Since the early 1980s I’ve been interested in molecular computing, and in how computation might be done at the level of molecules. My discoveries in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> (and specifically the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>) convinced me that it should be possible to get even fairly simple collections of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-11--implications-for-technology'>molecules to &#8220;do arbitrary computations&#8221;</a> or even build more or less arbitrary structures (in a more general and streamlined way than happens with the whole protein synthesis structure in biology). And over the years, I sometimes thought about trying to do practical work in this area. But it didn’t feel as if the ambient technology was quite ready. So I never jumped in.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I’d long understood the basic correspondence between <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a> and patterns of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-11--implications-for-chemistry/'>possible pathways for chemical reactions</a>. And after our Physics Project was announced in 2020 and we began to develop the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>general multicomputational paradigm</a>, I immediately considered <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular computing</a> a potential application. But just what might the “choreography” of molecules be like? What causal relationships might there be, for example, between different interactions of the same molecule? That’s not something ordinary chemistry—dealing for example with liquid-phase reactions—tends to consider important.</p>\n<p>But what I increasingly started to wonder is whether in molecular biology it might actually be crucial. And even in the 20 years since <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was published, it’s become increasingly clear that in molecular biology things are extremely “orchestrated”. It’s not about molecules randomly moving around, like in a liquid. It’s about molecules being carefully channeled and actively transported from one “event” to another.</p>\n<p>Class 3 cellular automata seem to be good “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#metamodeling-and-the-metatheory-of-models'>metamodels</a>” for things like liquids, and readily give Second-Law-like behavior. But what about the kind of situation that seems to exist in molecular biology? It’s something I’ve been thinking about only recently, but I think this is a place where class 4 cellular automata can contribute. I’ve started calling the “bulk limit” of class 4 systems the “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#class-4-and-the-mechanoidal-phase'>mechanoidal phase</a>”. It’s a place where the ordinary Second Law doesn’t seem to apply.</p>\n<p>Four decades ago when I was trying to understand how structure could arise “in violation of the Second Law” I didn’t yet even know about computational irreducibility. But now we’ve come a lot further, in particular with the development of the multicomputational paradigm, and the recognition of the importance of the characteristics of the observer in defining what perceived overall laws there will be. It’s an inevitable feature of computational irreducibility that there will always be an infinite sequence of new challenges for science, and new pieces of computational reducibility to be found. So, now, yes, a challenge is to understand the mechanoidal phase. And with all the tools and ideas we’ve developed, I’m hoping the process will happen more than it has for the ordinary Second Law.</p>\n<h2 id='the-end-of-a-50-year-journey'>The End of a 50-Year Journey</h2>\n<p>I began my quest to understand the Second Law a bit more than 50 years ago. And—even though there’s certainly more to say and figure out—it’s very satisfying now to be able to bring a certain amount of closure to what has been the single longest-running piece of intellectual “unfinished business” in my life. It’s been an interesting journey—that’s very much relied on, and at times helped drive, the tower of science and technology that I’ve spent my life building. There are many things that might not have happened as they did. And in the end it’s been a story of longterm intellectual tenacity—stretching across much of my life so far.</p>\n<p>For a long time I’ve kept (automatically when possible) quite <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/'>extensive archives</a>. And now these archives allow one to reconstruct in almost unprecedented detail my journey with the Second Law. One sees the gradual formation of intellectual frameworks over the course of years, then the occasional discovery or realization that allows one to take the next step in what is sometimes mere days. There’s a curious interweaving of computational and essentially philosophical methodologies—with an occasional dash of mathematics.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there’s general intuition that’s significantly ahead of specific results. But more often there’s a surprise computational discovery that seeds the development of new intuition. And, yes, it’s a little embarrassing how often I managed to generate in a computer experiment something that I completely failed to interpret or even notice at first because I didn’t have the right intellectual framework or intuition.</p>\n<p>And in the end, there’s an air of computational irreducibility to the whole process: there really wasn’t a way to shortcut the intellectual development; one just had to live it. Already in the 1990s I had taken things a fair distance, and I had even written a little about what I had figured out. But for years it hung out there as one of a small collection of unfinished projects: to finally round out the intellectual story of the Second Law, and to write down an exposition of it. But the arrival of our Physics Project just over two years ago brought both a cascade of new ideas, and for me personally a sense that even things that had been out there for a long time could in fact be brought to closure.</p>\n<p>And so it is that I’ve returned to the quest I began when I was 12 years old—but now with five decades of new tools and new ideas. The wonder and magic of the Second Law is still there. But now I’m able to see it in a much broader context, and to realize that it’s not just a law about thermodynamics and heat, but instead a window into a very general computational phenomenon. None of this I could know when I was 12 years old. But somehow the quest I was drawn to all those years ago has turned out to be deeply aligned with the whole arc of intellectual development that I have followed in my life. And no doubt it’s no coincidence.</p>\n<p>But for now I’m just grateful to have had the quest to understand Second Law as one of my guiding forces through so much of my life, and now to realize that my quest was part of something so broad and so deep.</p>\n<h2 id='appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>Appendix: The Backstory of the Book Cover That Started It All</h2>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img166.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img166.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='530' height='297'></a></p>\n<p>What is the backstory of the book cover that launched my long journey with the Second Law?

It turned out to be a complex story, reaching back to the earliest serious uses of computers for basic science, and even beyond.</p>\n<p>The book had been born out the sense of urgency around science education in the US that followed the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union—with a group of professors from Berkeley and Harvard believing that the teaching of freshman college physics was in need of modernization, and that they should write a series of textbooks to enable this. (It was also the time of the “new math”, and a host of other STEM-related educational initiatives.) <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Reif' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fred Reif</a> (who died at the age of 92 in 2019) was asked to write the statistical physics volume.

And in 2001 I was able to tell Fred Reif that, yes, his book had indeed been useful. He said he was pleased to learn that, adding “It is all too rare that one’s educational efforts seem to bear some fruit.”</p>\n<p>He explained to me that when he was writing the book he thought that “the basic ideas of irreversibility and fluctuations might be very vividly illustrated by the behavior of a gas of particles spreading through a box”. He added: “It then occurred to me that Berni Alder might actually show this by a computer generated film since he had worked on molecular dynamics simulations and had also good computer facilities available to him. I was able to enlist Berni’s interest in this project, with the results shown in my book.”</p>\n<p>The acknowledgements in the book report:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img171.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img171.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='556' height='185'></a></p>\n<p>Berni Alder and and Fred Reif did indeed create a “film loop”, which “could be bought separately from the book and viewed in the physics lab”, as Alder told me, adding that “I understand the students liked it very much, but the venture was not a commercial success.” Still, he sent me a copy of a videotape version:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img172.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img172.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='440' height='259'></a></p>\n<p>The film (which has no sound) begins:</p>\n<p>\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img173.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img173.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='170'></a></p>\n<p>Soon it’s showing an actual process of “coming to equilibrium”:</p>\n<p><video width=\"614\" height=\"264\" controls><source src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw12journey122822-video.mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>“However”, as Alder explained it to me, “if a large number of particles are put in the corner and the velocities of all the particles are reversed after a certain time, the audience laughs or is supposed to after all the particles return to their original positions.” (One suspects that particularly in the 1960s this might have been reminiscent of various cartoon-film gags.)</p>\n<p>OK, so how were the pictures (and the film) made? It was done in 1964 at what’s now <a href='https://www.llnl.gov/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lawrence Livermore Lab</a> (that had been created in 1952 as a spinoff of the <a href='https://history.aip.org/exhibits/lawrence/radlab.htm' target=_blank rel=noopener>Berkeley Radiation Lab</a>, which had initiated some key pieces for the Manhattan Project) on a computer called the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_LARC' target=_blank rel=noopener>LARC (&#8220;Livermore Advanced Research Computer&#8221;)</a>, first made in 1960, that was probably the most advanced scientific computer of the time. Alder explained to me, however: “We could not run the problem much longer than about 10 collision times with 64 bits [<em>sic</em>] arithmetic before the round-off error prevented the particles from returning.”</p>\n<p>Why did they start the particles off in a somewhat random configuration? (The randomness, Alder told me, had been created by a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-5--random-number-generators/'>middle-square random number generator</a>.) Apparently if they’d been in a regular array—which would have made the whole process of randomization much easier to see—the roundoff errors would have been too obvious. (And it’s issues like this that made it so hard to recognize the rule 30 phenomenon in systems based on real numbers—and without the idea of just studying simple programs not tied to traditional equation-based formulations of physics.)</p>\n<p>The actual code for the molecular dynamics simulation was written in assembler and run by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ann_Mansigh' target=_blank rel=noopener>Mary Ann Mansigh (Karlsen)</a>, who had a degree in math and chemistry and worked as a programmer at Livermore from 1955 until the 1980s, much of the time specifically with Alder. Here she is at the console of the LARC (yes, computers had built-in desks in those days):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img174.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img174.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='334' height='253'></a></p>\n<p>The program that was used was called STEP, and the original version of it had actually been written (by a certain <a href='http://www.cap-lore.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Norm Hardy</a>, who ended up having a long Silicon Valley career) to run on a previous generation of computer. (A still-earlier program was called APE, for “Approach to Equilibrium”.) But it was only with the LARC—and STEP—that things were fast enough to run substantial simulations, at the rate of about 200,000 collisions per hour (the simulation for the book cover involved 40 particles and about 500 collisions). At the time of the book STEP used an <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> algorithm where all pairs of particles were tested for collisions; later a neighborhood-based linked list method was used.</p>\n<p>The standard method of getting output from a computer back in 1964—and basically until the 1980s—was to print characters on paper. But the LARC could also drive an oscilloscope, and it was with this that the graphics for the book were created (capturing them from the oscilloscope screen with a Polaroid instant camera).</p>\n<p>But why was Berni Alder studying molecular dynamics and “hard sphere gases” in the first place? Well, that’s another long story. But ultimately it was driven by the effort to develop a microscopic theory of liquids.</p>\n<p>The notion that gases might consist of discrete molecules in motion <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#what-is-heat?'>had arisen in the 1700s</a> (and even to some extent in antiquity), but it was only in the mid-1800s that serious <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>development of the &#8220;kinetic theory&#8221; idea</a> began. Pretty immediately it was clear how to derive the ideal gas law <em>P V</em> = <em>R T</em> for essentially non-interacting molecules. But what analog of this “equation of state” might apply to gases with significant interactions between molecules, or, for that matter, liquids? In 1873 <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals' target=_blank rel=noopener>Johannes Diderik van der Waals</a> proposed, on essentially empirical grounds, the formula (<em>P</em> + <em>a</em>/<em>V</em><sup>2</sup>)(<em>V</em>&#8211;<em>b</em>) = <em>RT</em>—where the parameter <em>b</em> represented “excluded volume” taken up by molecules, that were implicitly being viewed as hard spheres. But could such a formula be derived—like the ideal gas law—from a microscopic kinetic theory of molecules? At the time, nobody really knew how to start, and the problem languished for more than half a century.</p>\n<p>(It’s worth pointing out, by the way, that the idea of modeling gases, as opposed to liquids, as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>collections of hard spheres was extensively pursued</a> in the mid-1800s, notably by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Maxwell/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Maxwell</a> and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boltzmann/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Boltzmann</a>—though with their traditional mathematical analysis methods, they were limited to studying average properties of what amount to dilute gases.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there was increasing interest in the microscopic structure of liquids, particularly among chemists concerned for example with how chemical solutions might work. And at the end of the 1920s the technique of x-ray diffraction, which had originally been used to study the microscopic structure of crystals, was applied to liquids—allowing in particular the experimental determination of the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PairCorrelationG.html'>radial distribution function</a> (or pair correlation function) <em>g</em>(<em>r</em>), which gives the probability to find another molecule a distance <em>r</em> from a given one.</p>\n<p>But how might this radial distribution function be computed? By the mid-1930s there were several proposals based on <a href='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.80.2067.125' target=_blank rel=noopener>looking at the statistics of random assemblies</a> of hard spheres:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img178.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img178.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='185' height='188'></a></p>\n<p>Some tried to get results by mathematical methods; others did physical experiments with ball bearings and gelatin balls, <a href='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.80.2067.125' target=_blank rel=noopener>getting at least rough agreement</a> with actual experiments on liquids:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img179.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img179.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='355' height='306'></a></p>\n<p>But then in 1939 a physical chemist named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gamble_Kirkwood' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Kirkwood</a> gave an <a href='https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1750344' target=_blank rel=noopener>actual probabilistic derivation</a> (using a variety of simplifying assumptions) that fairly closely reproduced the radial distribution function:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img180.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img180.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='168'></a></p>\n<p>But what about just computing from first principles, on the basis of the mechanics of colliding molecules? Back in 1872 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>Ludwig Boltzmann had proposed a statistical equation</a> (the “Boltzmann transport equation”) for the behavior of collections of molecules, that was based on the approximation of independent probabilities for individual molecules. By the 1940s the independence assumption had been overcome, but at the cost of introducing an infinite hierarchy of equations (the “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBGKY_hierarchy' target=_blank rel=noopener>BBGKY hierarchy</a>”, where the “K” stood for Kirkwood). And although the full equations were intractable, approximations were suggested that—while themselves mathematically sophisticated—seemed as if they should, at least in principle, be applicable to liquids.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in 1948, Berni Alder, fresh from a master&#8217;s degree in chemical engineering, and already interested in liquids, went to Caltech to work on a PhD with John Kirkwood—who suggested that he look at a couple of approximations to the BBGKY hierarchy for the case of hard spheres. This led to some nasty integro-differential equations which couldn&#8217;t be solved by analytical techniques. Caltech didn&#8217;t yet have a computer in the modern sense, but in 1949 they acquired an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_604' target=_blank rel=noopener>IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch</a>, which could be wired to do calculations with input and output specified on punched cards—and it was on this machine that Alder got the calculations he needed done (the paper records that “[this] &#8230; was calculated &#8230; with the use of IBM equipment and the file of punched cards of <em>sin</em>(<em>ut</em>) employed in these laboratories for electron diffraction calculation”):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img181.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img181.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='212'></a></p>\n<p>Our story now moves to Los Alamos, where in 1947 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ulam/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Stan Ulam</a> had suggested the Monte Carlo method as a way to study neutron diffusion. In 1949 the method was implemented on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC' target=_blank rel=noopener>ENIAC computer</a>. And in 1952 Los Alamos got its own <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I' target=_blank rel=noopener>MANIAC computer</a>. Meanwhile, there was significant interest at Los Alamos in computing equations of state for matter, especially in extreme conditions such as those in a nuclear explosion. And by 1953 the idea had arisen of using the Monte Carlo method to do this.</p>\n<p>The concept was to take a collection of hard spheres (or actually 2D disks), and move them randomly in a series of steps with the constraint that they could not overlap—then look at the statistics of the resulting “equilibrium” configurations. This was done on the MANIAC, with the resulting paper now giving “Monte Carlo results” for things like the radial distribution function:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img182.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img182.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='590' height='494'></a></p>\n<p>Kirkwood and Alder had been continuing their BBGKY hierarchy work, now using more realistic Lennard-Jones forces between molecules. But by 1954 Alder was also using the Monte Carlo method, implementing it partly (rather painfully) on the IBM Electronic Calculating Punch, and partly on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_computers' target=_blank rel=noopener>Manchester Mark II</a> computer in the UK (whose documentation had been written by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/06/happy-100th-birthday-alan-turing/'>Alan Turing</a>):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img183.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img183.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='614' height='142'></a></p>\n<p>In 1955 Alder started working full-time at Livermore, recruited by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller' target=_blank rel=noopener>Edward Teller</a>. Another Livermore recruit—fresh from a physics PhD—was <a href='https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/eastbaytimes/name/thomas-wainwright-obituary?id=32749324' target=_blank rel=noopener>Thomas Wainwright</a>. And soon Alder and Wainwright came up with an alternative to the Monte Carlo method—that would eventually give the book cover pictures: just explicitly compute the dynamics of colliding hard spheres, with the expectation that after enough collisions the system would come to equilibrium and allow things like equations of state to be obtained.</p>\n<p>In 1953 Livermore had obtained its first computer: a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I' target=_blank rel=noopener>Remington Rand Univac I</a>. And it was on this computer that Alder and Wainwright did a first proof of concept of their method, tracing 100 hard spheres with collisions computed at the rate of about 100 per hour. Then in 1955 Livermore got <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704' target=_blank rel=noopener>IBM 704</a> computers, which, with their hardware floating-point capabilities, were able to compute about 2000 collisions per hour.</p>\n<p>Alder and Wainwright reported their first results at a statistical mechanics conference in Brussels in August 1956 (organized by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ilya Prigogine</a>). The published version appeared in 1958:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img184.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img184.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='392' height='195'></a></p>\n<p>It gives evidence—that they tagged as “provisional”—for the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>emergence of a Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution</a> “after the system reached equilibrium”</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img185.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img185.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='256' height='210'></a></p>\n<p>as well as things like the radial distribution function—and the equation of state:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img186.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img186.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='585' height='209'></a></p>\n<p>It was notable that there seemed to be a discrepancy between the results for the equation of state computed by explicit molecular dynamics and by the Monte Carlo method. And what is more, there seemed to be evidence of some kind of discontinuous phase-transition-like behavior as the density of spheres changed (an effect which Kirkwood had predicted in 1949).</p>\n<p>Given the small system sizes and short runtimes it was all a bit muddy. But by August 1957 Alder and Wainwright announced that they’d found a phase transition, presumably between a high-density phase where the spheres were packed together like in a crystalline solid, and a low-density phase, where they were able to more freely “wander around” like in a liquid or gas. Meanwhile, the group at Los Alamos had redone their Monte Carlo calculations, and they too now claimed a phase transition. Their papers were published back to back:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img187.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img187.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='369'></a></p>\n<p>But at this point no actual pictures of molecular trajectories had yet been published, or, I believe, made. All there was were traditional plots of aggregated quantities. And in 1958, these plots made their first appearance in a textbook. Tucked into Appendix C of <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/elementarystatis0000kitt' target=_blank rel=noopener>Elementary Statistical Physics</a></em> by Berkeley physics professor <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kittel' target=_blank rel=noopener>Charles Kittel</a> (who would later be chairman of the group developing the Berkeley Physics Course book series) were two rather confusing plots about the approach to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution taken from a pre-publication version of Alder and Wainwright’s paper:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img188.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img188.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='578' height='473'></a></p>\n<p>Alder and Wainwright’s phase transition result had created enough of a stir that they were asked to write a <em>Scientific American</em> article about it. And in that article—entitled “<a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/molecular-motions/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Molecular Motions</a>”, from October 1959—there were finally pictures of actual trajectories, with their caption explaining that the “paths of particles &#8230; appear as bright lines on the face of a cathode-ray tube hooked to a computer” (the paths are of the centers of the colliding disks):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img189.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img189.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='507' height='519'></a></p>\n<p>A <a href='https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1730376' target=_blank rel=noopener>technical article</a> published at the same time gave a diagram of the logic for the dynamical computation:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img190.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img190.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='420' height='515'></a></p>\n<p>Then in 1960 Livermore (after various delays) took delivery of the LARC computer—arguably the first scientific supercomputer—which allowed molecular dynamics computations to be done perhaps 20 times times faster. A 1962 picture shows Berni Alder (left) and Thomas Wainwright (right) looking at outputs from the LARC with Mary Ann Mansigh (yes, in those days it was typical for male physicists to wear ties):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img191.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img191.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='491' height='373'></a></p>\n<p>And in 1964, the pictures for the <em>Statistical Physics</em> book (and film loop) got made, with Mary Ann Mansigh painstakingly constructing images of disks on the oscilloscope display.</p>\n<p>Work on molecular dynamics continued, though to do it required the most powerful computers, so for many years it was pretty much restricted to places like Livermore. And in 1967, Alder and Wainwright made another discovery about hard spheres. Even in their first paper about molecular dynamics they’d plotted the velocity autocorrelation function, and noted that it decayed roughly exponentially with time. But by 1967 they had much more precise data, and realized that there was a deviation from exponential decay: a definite “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-999d/'>long-time tail</a>”. And soon they had figured out that this power-law tail was basically the result of a continuum hydrodynamic effect (essentially a vortex) operating even on the scale of a few molecules. (And—though it didn’t occur to me at the time—this should have suggested that even with fairly small numbers of cells cellular automaton fluid simulations had a good chance of giving recognizable hydrodynamic results.)</p>\n<p>It’s never been entirely easy to do molecular dynamics, even with hard spheres, not least because in standard computations one’s inevitably confronted with things like numerical roundoff errors. And no doubt this is why some of the obvious foundational questions about the Second Law weren’t really explored there, and why intrinsic randomness generation and the rule 30 phenomenon weren’t identified.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, even before molecular dynamics emerged, there was already one computer study of what could potentially have been Second Law behavior. Visiting Los Alamos in the early 1950s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi' target=_blank rel=noopener>Enrico Fermi</a> had gotten interested in using computers for physics, and wondered what would happen if one simulated the motion of an array of masses with nonlinear springs between them. The results of running this on the MANIAC computer were <a href='https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4376203' target=_blank rel=noopener>reported in 1955</a> (after Fermi had died)</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4376203\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img192.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img192.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='392' height='656'></a></p>\n<p>and it was noted that there wasn’t just exponential approach to equilibrium, but instead something more complicated (later connected to solitons). Strangely, though, instead of plotting actual particle trajectories, what were given were mode energies—but these still exhibited what, if it hadn’t been obscured by continuum issues, might have been recognized as something like the rule 30 phenomenon:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img193.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img193.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='474' height='294'></a></p>\n<p>But I knew none of this history when I saw the <em>Statistical Physics</em> book cover in 1972. And indeed, for all I knew, it could have been a “standard statistical physics cover picture”. I didn’t know it was the first of its kind—and a leading-edge example of the use of computers for basic science, accessible only with the most powerful computers of the time. Of course, had I known those things, I probably wouldn’t have tried to reproduce the picture myself and I wouldn’t have had that early experience in trying to use a computer to do science. (Curiously enough, looking at the numbers now, I realize that the base speed of the LARC was only 20x the Elliott 903C, though with floating point, etc.—a factor that pales in comparison with the 500x speedup in computers in the 40 years since I started working on cellular automata.)</p>\n<p>But now I know the history of that book cover, and where it came from. And what I only just discovered now is that actually there’s a bigger circle than I knew. Because the path from Berni Alder to that book cover to my work on cellular automaton fluids came full circle—when in 1988 Alder <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.381' target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote a paper based on cellular automaton fluids</a> (though through the vicissitudes of academic behavior I don’t think he knew these had been my idea—and now it’s too late to tell him his role in seeding them):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img194.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img194.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='590' height='285'></a></p>\n<p id='notes-and-thanks' style=\"color:#c42c1f\"><em>Notes &#038; Thanks</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">There are many people who’ve contributed to the 50-year journey I’ve described here. Some I’ve already mentioned by name, but others not—including many who doubtless wouldn’t even be aware that they contributed. The longtime store clerk at Blackwell’s bookstore who in 1972 sold college physics books to a 12-year old without batting an eye. (I learned his name—Keith Clack—30 years later when he organized a book signing for <em>A New Kind of Science</em> at Blackwell’s.) John Helliwell and Lawrence Wickens who in 1977 invited me to give the first talk where I explicitly discussed the foundations of the Second Law. Douglas Abraham who in 1977 taught a course on mathematical statistical mechanics that I attended. Paul Davies who wrote a book on <em>The Physics of Time Asymmetry</em> that I read around that time. Rocky Kolb who in 1979 and 1980 worked with me on cosmology that used statistical mechanics. The students (including professors like Steve Frautschi and David Politzer) who attended my 1981 class at Caltech about “nonequilibrium statistical mechanics”. David Pines and Elliott Lieb who in 1983 were responsible for publishing my breakout paper on “Statistical Mechanics of Cellular Automata”. Charles Bennett (curiously, a student of Berni Alder’s) with whom in the early 1980s I discussed applying computation theory (notably the ideas of Greg Chaitin) to physics. Brian Hayes who commissioned my 1984 <em>Scientific American</em> article, and Peter Brown who edited it. Danny Hillis and Sheryl Handler who in 1984 got me involved with Thinking Machines. Jim Salem and Bruce Nemnich (Walker) who worked on fluid dynamics on the Connection Machine with me. Then—36 years later—Jonathan Gorard and Max Piskunov, who catalyzed the doing of our Physics Project.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In the last 50 years, there’ve been surprisingly few people with whom I’ve directly discussed the foundations of the Second Law. Perhaps one reason is that back when I was a “professional physicist” statistical mechanics as a whole wasn’t a prominent area. But, more important, as I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>described elsewhere</a>, for more than a century most physicists have effectively assumed that the foundations of the Second Law are a solved (or at least merely pedantic) problem.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Probably the single person with whom I had the most discussions about the foundations of the Second Law is Richard Feynman. But there are others with whom at one time or another I’ve discussed related issues, including: Bruce Boghosian, Richard Crandall, Roger Dashen, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Nigel Goldenfeld, Theodore Gray, Bill Hayes, Joel Lebowitz, David Levermore, Ed Lorenz, John Maddox, Roger Penrose, Ilya Prigogine, Rudy Rucker, David Ruelle, Rob Shaw, Yakov Sinai, Michael Trott, Léon van Hove and Larry Yaffe. (There are also many others with whom I’ve discussed general issues about origins of randomness.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Finally, one technical note about the presentation here: in an effort to maintain a clearer timeline, I’ve typically shown the earliest drafts or preprint versions of papers that I have. Their final published versions (if indeed they were ever published) appeared anything from weeks to years later, sometimes with changes.</p>\n",

The Tangled History of the Second Law of Thermodynamics\" width='620' height='315'></p>\n<p><!--Section 01 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='the-basic-arc-of-the-story'>The Basic Arc of the Story</h2>\n<p>As I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>explained elsewhere</a>, I think I now finally understand the Second Law of thermodynamics. But it’s a new understanding, and to get to it I’ve had to overcome a certain amount of conventional wisdom about the Second Law that I at least have long taken for granted. And to check myself I’ve been keen to know just where this conventional wisdom came from, how it’s been validated, and what might have made it go astray.</p>\n<p>And from this I’ve been led into a rather detailed examination of the origins and history of thermodynamics. All in all, it’s a fascinating story, that both explains what’s been believed about thermodynamics, and provides some powerful examples of the complicated dynamics of the development and acceptance of ideas.<span id=\"more-42402\"></span></p>\n<p>The basic concept of the Second Law was first formulated in the 1850s, and rather rapidly took on something close to its modern form. It began partly as an empirical law, and partly as something abstractly constructed on the basis of the idea of molecules, that nobody at the time knew for sure existed. But by the end of the 1800s, with the existence of molecules increasingly firmly established, the Second Law began to often be treated as an almost-mathematically-proven necessary law of physics. There were still mathematical loose ends, as well as issues such as its application to living systems and to systems involving gravity. But the almost-universal conventional wisdom became that the Second Law must always hold, and if it didn’t seem to in a particular case, then that must just be because there was something one didn’t yet understand about that case.</p>\n<p>There was also a sense that regardless of its foundations, the Second Law was successfully used in practice. And indeed particularly in chemistry and engineering it’s often been in the background, justifying all the computations routinely done using entropy. But despite its ubiquitous appearance in textbooks, when it comes to foundational questions, there’s always been a certain air of mystery around the Second Law. Though after 150 years there’s typically an assumption that “somehow it must all have been worked out”. I myself have been interested in the Second Law now for a little more than 50 years, and over that time I’ve had a growing awareness that actually, no, it hasn’t all been worked out. Which is why, now, it’s wonderful to see the computational paradigm—and ideas from our Physics Project—after all these years be able to provide solid foundations for understanding the Second Law, as well as seeing its limitations.</p>\n<p>And from the vantage point of the understanding we now have, we can go back and realize that there were precursors of it even from long ago. In some ways it’s all an inspiring tale—of how there were scientists with ideas ahead of their time, blocked only by the lack of a conceptual framework that would take another century to develop. But in other ways it’s also a cautionary tale, of how the forces of “conventional wisdom” can blind people to unanswered questions and—over a surprisingly long time—inhibit the development of new ideas.</p>\n<p>But, first and foremost, the story of the Second Law is the story of a great intellectual achievement of the mid-19th century. It’s exciting now, of course, to be able to use the latest 21st-century ideas to take another step. But to appreciate how this fits in with what’s already known we have to go back and study the history of what originally led to the Second Law, and how what emerged as conventional wisdom about it took shape.</p>\n<p><!--Section 2 What Is Heat?--></p>\n<h2 id='what-is-heat?'>What Is Heat?</h2>\n<p>Once it became clear what heat is, it actually didn’t take long for the Second Law to be formulated. But for centuries—and indeed until the mid-1800s—there was all sorts of confusion about the nature of heat. </p>\n<p>That there&#8217;s a distinction between hot and cold is a matter of basic human perception. And seeing fire one might imagine it as a disembodied form of heat. In ancient Greek times <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Heraclitus'>Heraclitus</a> (~500 BC) talked about everything somehow being &#8220;made of fire&#8221;, and also somehow being intrinsically &#8220;in motion”. <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Democritus/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Democritus</a> (~460–~370 BC) and the Epicureans had the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--atomism/'>important idea</a> (that also arose independently in other cultures) that everything might be made of large numbers of a few types of tiny discrete atoms. They imagined these atoms moving around in the &#8220;void&#8221; of space. And when it came to heat, they seem to have correctly associated it with the motion of atoms—though they imagined it came from particular spherical &#8220;fire&#8221; atoms that could slide more quickly between other atoms, and they also thought that souls were the ultimate sources of motion and heat (at least in warm-blooded animals?), and were made of fire atoms.</p>\n<p>And for two thousand years that&#8217;s pretty much where things stood. And indeed in 1623 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Galileo</a> (1564–1642) (in his book <em><a href='https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>The Assayer</a></em>, about weighing competing world theories) was <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.\\\npdf#page=25\" target=_blank rel=noopener>still saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Those materials which produce heat in us and make us feel warmth, which are known by the general name of “fire,” would then be a multitude of minute particles having certain shapes and moving with certain velocities. Meeting with our bodies, they penetrate by means of their extreme subtlety, and their touch as felt by us when they pass through our substance is the sensation we call “heat.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.\\\npdf#page=25\" target=_blank rel=noopener>goes on</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Since the presence of fire-corpuscles alone does not suffice to excite heat, but their motion is needed also, it seems to me that one may very reasonably say that motion is the cause of heat&#8230; But I hold it to be silly to accept that proposition in the ordinary way, as if a stone or piece of iron or a stick must heat up when moved. The rubbing together and friction of two hard bodies, either by resolving their parts into very subtle flying particles or by opening an exit for the tiny fire-corpuscles within, ultimately sets these in motion; and when they meet our bodies and penetrate them, our conscious mind feels those pleasant or unpleasant sensations which we have named heat&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And although he can tell there’s something different about it, he <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.\\\npdf#page=20\" target=_blank rel=noopener>thinks of heat</a> as effectively being associated with a substance or material: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The tenuous material which produces heat is even more subtle than that which causes odor, for the latter cannot leak through a glass container, whereas the material of heat makes its way through any substance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 1620, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Francis+Bacon'>Francis Bacon</a> (1561–1626) (in his “update on Aristotle”, <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/neworganonrelate0000baco_g3u2' target=_blank rel=noopener>The New Organon</a></em>) says, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/neworganonrelate0000baco_g3u2/page/156/\\\nmode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>a little more abstractly</a>, if obscurely—and without any reference to atoms or substances:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">[It is not] that heat generates motion or that motion generates heat (though both are true in certain cases), but that heat itself, its essence and quiddity, is motion and nothing else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But real progress in understanding the nature of heat had to wait for more understanding about the nature of gases, with air being the prime example. (It was actually only in the 1640s that any kind of general notion of gas began to emerge—with the word “gas” being invented by the “anti-Galen” physician <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Jan+Baptista+van+Helmont'>Jan Baptista van Helmont</a> (1580–1644), as a Dutch rendering of the Greek word “chaos”, that meant essentially “void”, or primordial formlessness.) Ever since antiquity there’d been Aristotle-style explanations like “nature abhors a vacuum” about what nature “wants to do”. But by the mid-1600s the idea was emerging that there could be more explicit and mechanical explanations for phenomena in the natural world.</p>\n<p>And in 1660 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boyle/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Robert Boyle</a> (1627–1691)—now thoroughly committed to the experimental approach to science—published <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/chepfl-lipr-AXA74/page/23/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>New Experiments Physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects</a></em> in which he argued that air has an intrinsic pressure associated with it, which pushes it to fill spaces, and for which he effectively found Boyle’s Law <em>PV</em> = constant.</p>\n<p>But what was air actually made of? Boyle had two basic hypotheses that he explained in rather flowery terms: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/chepfl-lipr-AXA74/page/23/mode/2up\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img1.png\" width='620' height='1161' /></a></p>\n<p>His first hypothesis was that air might be like a “fleece of wool” made of “aerial corpuscles” (gases were later often called “aeriform fluids”) with a “power or principle of self-dilatation” that resulted from there being “hairs” or “little springs” between these corpuscles. But he had a second hypothesis too—based, he said, on the ideas of “that most ingenious gentleman, Monsieur Descartes”: that instead air consists of “flexible particles” that are “so whirled around” that “each corpuscle endeavors to beat off all others”. In this second hypothesis, Boyle’s “spring of the air” was effectively the result of particles bouncing off each other.</p>\n<p>And, as it happens, in 1668 there was quite an effort to understand the “laws of impact” (that would for example be applicable to balls in games like croquet and billiards, that had existed since at least the 1300s, and were becoming popular), with <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wallis/' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Wallis</a> (1616–1703), <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wren/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Christopher Wren</a> (1632–1723) and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Huygens/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Christiaan Huygens</a> (1629–1695) all contributing, and Huygens producing diagrams like:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img2.png\" data-url=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/departments/espm/env-hist/dissertation/ch_2.pdf\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img2.png\" width='472' height='384' /></a></p>\n<p>But while some understanding developed of what amount to impacts between pairs of hard spheres, there wasn’t the mathematical methodology—or probably the idea—to apply this to large collections of spheres.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in his 1687 <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Newton/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Isaac Newton</a> (1642–1727), wanting to analyze the properties of self-gravitating spheres of fluid, discussed the idea that fluids could in effect be made up of arrays of particles held apart by repulsive forces, as in Boyle&#8217;s first hypothesis. Newton had of course had great success with his 1/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> universal attractive force for gravity. But now he noted (writing originally in Latin) that with a 1/<em>r</em> repulsive force between particles in a fluid, he could essentially reproduce Boyle’s law: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img4.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/n7/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img4.png\" width='504' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>Newton discussed questions like whether one particle would “shield” others from the force, but <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/302/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>then concluded</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">But whether elastic fluids do really consist of particles so repelling each other, is a physical question.

There was one major exception, however, in 1738, when—as part of his eclectic mathematical career spanning probability theory, elasticity theory, biostatistics, economics and more—<a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Daniel/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Daniel Bernoulli</a> (1700–1782) published his book on hydrodynamics.

As it is well known that heat is intensified as the internal motion of the particles increases, it follows that any increase in the pressure of air that has not changed its volume indicates more intense motion of its particles, which is in agreement with our hypothesis&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But at the time, and in fact for more than a century thereafter, this wasn’t followed up.</p>\n<p>A large part of the reason seems to have been that people just assumed that heat ultimately had to have some kind of material existence; to think that it was merely a manifestation of microscopic motion was too abstract an idea. And then there was the observation of “radiant heat” (i.e. infrared radiation)—that seemed like it could only work by explicitly transferring some kind of “heat material” from one body to another.</p>\n<p>But what was this “heat material”? It was thought of as a fluid—called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory' target=_blank rel=noopener>caloric</a>—that could suffuse matter, and for example flow from a hotter body to a colder. And in an echo of Democritus, it was often assumed that caloric consisted of particles that could slide between ordinary particles of matter. There was some thought that it might be related to the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory' target=_blank rel=noopener>phlogiston</a> from the mid-1600s, that was effectively a chemical substance, for example participating in chemical reactions or being generated in combustion (through the “principle of fire”). But the more mainstream view was that there were caloric particles that would collect around ordinary particles of matter (often called “molecules”, after the use of that term by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Descartes/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Descartes</a> (1596–1650) in 1620), generating a repulsive force that would for example expand gases—and that in various circumstances these caloric particles would move around, corresponding to the transfer of heat.</p>\n<p>To us today it might seem hacky and implausible (perhaps a little like dark matter, cosmological inflation, etc.), but the caloric theory lasted for more than two hundred years and managed to explain plenty of phenomena—and indeed was certainly going strong in 1825 when Laplace wrote his <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/treatiseofcelest12lapl/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>A Treatise of Celestial Mechanics</a></em>, which included a successful computation of properties of gases like the speed of sound and the ratio of specific heats, on the basis of a somewhat elaborated and mathematicized version of caloric theory (that by then included the concept of “caloric rays” associated with radiant heat).</p>\n<p>But even though it wasn’t understood what heat ultimately was, one could still measure its attributes. Already in antiquity there were devices that made use of heat to produce pressure or mechanical motion. And by the beginning of the 1600s—catalyzed by Galileo’s development of the thermoscope (in which heated liquid could be seen to expand up a tube)—the idea quickly caught on of making thermometers, and of quantitatively measuring temperature.</p>\n<p>And given a measurement of temperature, one could correlate it with effects one saw. So, for example, in the late 1700s the French balloonist <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles' target=_blank rel=noopener>Jacques Charles</a> (1746–1823) noted the linear increase of volume of a gas with temperature. Meanwhile, at the beginning of the 1800s <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fourier/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Joseph Fourier</a> (1768–1830) (science advisor to Napoleon) developed what became his 1822 <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00jose/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Analytical Theory of Heat</em></a>, and in it he begins <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00jose/page/n33/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>by noting that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Heat, like gravity, penetrates every substance of the universe, its rays occupy all parts of space. The object of our work is to set forth the mathematical laws which this element obeys. The theory of heat will hereafter form one of the most important branches of general physics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later he describes what he calls the “Principle of the Communication of Heat”. He refers to “molecules”—though basically just to indicate a small amount of substance—and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00jose/page/n11/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">When two molecules of the same solid are extremely near and at unequal temperatures, the most heated molecule communicates to that which is less heated a quantity of heat exactly expressed by the product of the duration of the instant, of the extremely small difference of the temperatures, and of certain function of the distance of the molecules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>then goes on to develop what’s now called the heat equation and all sorts of mathematics around it, all the while effectively adopting a caloric theory of heat. (And, yes, if you think of heat as a fluid it does lead you to describe its “motion” in <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/HeatTransferPDEModels.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>terms of differential equations</a> just like Fourier did. Though it’s then ironic that Bernoulli, even though he studied hydrodynamics, seemed to have a less “fluid-based” view of heat.)</p>\n<p><!--Section 3 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='heat-engines-and-the-beginnings-of-thermodynamics'>Heat Engines and the Beginnings of Thermodynamics</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the 1800s the Industrial Revolution was in full swing—driven in no small part by the availability of <a href='https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-why-wasnt-the-steam' target=_blank rel=noopener>increasingly efficient steam engines</a>. There had been precursors of steam engines even in antiquity, but it was only in 1712 that the first practical steam engine was developed. And after <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=james+watt'>James Watt</a> (1736–1819) produced a much more efficient version in 1776, the adoption of steam engines began to take off. </p>\n<p>Over the years that followed there were all sorts of engineering innovations that increased the efficiency of steam engines. But it wasn’t clear how far it could go—and whether for example there was a limit to how much mechanical work could ever, even in principle, be derived from a given amount of heat. And it was the investigation of this question—in the hands of a young French engineer named <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Carnot_Sadi/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sadi Carnot</a> (1796–1832)—that began the development of an abstract basic science of thermodynamics, and to the Second Law.</p>\n<p>The story really begins with Sadi Carnot&#8217;s father, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Carnot/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lazare Carnot</a> (1753–1823), who was trained as an engineer but ascended to the highest levels of French politics, and was involved with both the French Revolution and Napoleon. Particularly in years when he was out of political favor, Lazare Carnot worked on mathematics and mathematical engineering. His first significant work—in 1778—was entitled <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/lazarecarnotsava0000gill/page/270/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Memoir on the Theory of Machines</a></em>. The mathematical and geometrical science of mechanics was by then fairly well developed; Lazare Carnot&#8217;s objective was to understand its consequences for actual engineering machines, and to somehow abstract general principles from the mechanical details of the operation of those machines. In 1803 (alongside <a href='https://archive.org/details/deladfensedespla00carn/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>works on the geometrical theory of fortifications</a>) he published his <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/principesfondam02carngoog/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fundamental Principles of [Mechanical] Equilibrium and Movement</a></em>, which argued for what was at one time called (in a strange foreshadowing of reversible thermodynamic processes) &#8220;Carnot&#8217;s Principle&#8221;: that useful work in a machine will be maximized if accelerations and shocks of moving parts are minimized—and that a machine with perpetual motion is impossible. </p>\n<p>Sadi Carnot was born in 1796, and was largely educated by his father until he went to college in 1812. It’s notable that during the years when Sadi Carnot was a kid, one of his father’s activities was to give opinions on a whole range of inventions—including many steam engines and their generalizations. Lazare Carnot died in 1823. Sadi Carnot was by that point a well-educated but professionally undistinguished French military engineer. But in 1824, at the age of 28, he produced his one published work, <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QX9iIWF3yOMC/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, and on Machines to Develop That Power</a></em> (where by “fire” he meant what we would call heat):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img8.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/n25/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img8.png\" width='624' height='293' /></a></p>\n<p>The style and approach of the younger Carnot’s work is quite similar to his father’s. But the subject matter turned out to be more fruitful. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/3/mode/\\1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>The book begins</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Everyone knows that heat can produce motion. That it possesses vast motive-power none can doubt, in these days when the steam-engine is everywhere so well known&#8230; The study of these engines is of the greatest interest, their importance is enormous, their use is continually increasing, and they seem destined to produce a great revolution in the civilized world. Already the steam-engine works our mines, impels our ships, excavates our ports and our rivers, forges iron, fashions wood, grinds grain, spins and weaves our cloths, transports the heaviest burdens, etc. It appears that it must some day serve as a universal motor, and be substituted for animal power, water-falls, and air currents. &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Notwithstanding the work of all kinds done by steam-engines, notwithstanding the satisfactory condition to which they have been brought to-day, their theory is very little understood, and the attempts to improve them are still directed almost by chance. &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The question has often been raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam-engines have an assignable limit, a limit which the nature of things will not allow to be passed by any means whatever; or whether, on the contrary, these improvements may be carried on indefinitely. We propose now to submit these questions to a deliberate examination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carnot operated very much within the framework of caloric theory, and indeed his ideas were crucially based on the concept that one could think about “heat itself” (which for him was caloric fluid), independent of the material substance (like steam) that was hot. But—like his father’s efforts with mechanical machines—his goal was to develop an abstract “metamodel” of something like a steam engine, crucially assuming that the generation of unbounded heat or mechanical work (i.e. perpetual motion) in the closed cycle of the operation of the machine was impossible, and noting (again with a reflection of his father’s work) that the system would necessarily maximize efficiency if it operated reversibly. And he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/7/mode/\\1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>then argued that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The production of motive power is then due in steam-engines not to an actual consumption of caloric, but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body, that is, to its re-establishment of equilibrium&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, what was important about a steam engine was that it was a “heat engine”, that “moved heat around”. His book is mostly words, with just a few formulas related to the behavior of ideal gases, and some tables of actual parameters for particular materials. But even though his underlying conceptual framework—of caloric theory—was not correct, the abstract arguments that he made (that involved essentially logical consequences of reversibility and of operating in a closed cycle) were robust enough that it didn’t matter, and in particular he was able to successfully show that there was a theoretical maximum efficiency for a heat engine, that depended only on the temperatures of its hot and cold reservoirs of heat. But what’s important for our purposes here is that in the setup Carnot constructed he basically ended up introducing the Second Law.</p>\n<p>At the time it appeared, however, Carnot’s book was basically ignored, and Carnot died in obscurity from cholera in 1832 (about 9 months after <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galois/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Évariste Galois</a> (1811–1832)) at the age of 36. (The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadi_Carnot_(statesman)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sadi Carnot</a> who would later become president of France was his nephew.) But in 1834, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Clapeyron/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Émile Clapeyron</a> (1799–1864)—a rather distinguished French engineering professor (and steam engine designer)—wrote a paper entitled “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/100/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Memoir on the Motive Power of Heat</a>”. He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/74/\\mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>starts off by saying</a> about Carnot’s book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The idea which serves as a basis of his researches seems to me to be both fertile and beyond question; his demonstrations are founded on the absurdity of the possibility of creating motive power or heat out of nothing. … </p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">This new method of demonstration seems to me worthy of the attention of theoreticians; it seems to me to be free of all objection …</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I believe that it is of some interest to take up this theory again; S.

But what else might also be conserved? In the 1680s <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Gottfried Leibniz</a> (1646–1716) suggested the quantity <em>m v</em><sup>2</sup>, which he called, rather grandly, <em>vis viva—</em>or, in English, “life force”. And yes, in things like elastic collisions, this quantity did seem to be conserved. But in plenty of situations it wasn’t. By 1807 the term “energy” had been introduced, but the question remained of whether it could in any sense globally be thought of as conserved.</p>\n<p>It had seemed for a long time that heat was something a bit like mechanical energy, but the relation wasn’t clear—and the caloric theory of heat implied that caloric (i.e. the fluid corresponding to heat) was conserved, and so certainly wasn’t something that for example could be interconverted with mechanical energy. But in 1798 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Benjamin+Thompson+%28Count+Rumford%29'>Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford)</a> (1753–1814) measured the heat produced by the mechanical process of boring a cannon, and began to make the argument that, in contradiction to the caloric theory, there was actually some kind of correspondence between mechanical energy and amount of heat.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t a very accurate experiment, and it took until the 1840s—with new experiments by the English brewer and “amateur” scientist <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=James+Joule'>James Joule</a> (1818–1889) and the German physician <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Robert+Mayer'>Robert Mayer</a> (1814–1878)—before the idea of some kind of equivalence between heat and mechanical work began to look more plausible. And in 1847 this was something <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Thomson/' target=_blank rel=noopener>William Thomson</a> (1824–1907) (later Lord Kelvin)—a prolific young physicist recently graduated from the Mathematical Tripos in Cambridge and now installed as a professor of “natural philosophy” (i.e. physics) in Glasgow—began to be curious about.</p>\n<p>But first we have to go back a bit in the story. In 1845 Kelvin (as we’ll call him) had spent some time in Paris (primarily at at a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Victor_Regnault' target=_blank rel=noopener>lab that was measuring properties of steam</a> for the French government), and there he’d learned about Carnot’s work from Clapeyron’s paper (at first he couldn’t get a copy of Carnot’s actual book). Meanwhile, one of the issues of the time was a proliferation of different temperature scales based on using different kinds of thermometers based on different substances. And in 1848 Kelvin realized that Carnot’s concept of a “pure heat engine”—assumed at the time to be based on caloric—could be used to define an “absolute” scale of temperature in which, for example, at absolute zero all caloric would have been removed from all substances: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img12.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp33lond/page/312/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img12.png\" width='584' height='429' /></a></p>\n<p>Having found Carnot’s ideas useful, Kelvin in 1849 wrote a 33-page summary of them (small world that it was then, the immediately preceding paper in the journal is “<a href='https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/518/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Theory of Rolling Curves</a>”, written by the then-17-year-old <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Maxwell/' target=_blank rel=noopener>James Clerk Maxwell</a> (1831–1879), while the one that follows is “Theoretical Considerations on the Effect of Pressure in Lowering the Freezing Point of Water” by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Thomson_James/' target=_blank rel=noopener>James Thomson</a> (1786–1849), engineering-oriented older brother of William):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img13.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img13.png\" width='584' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He characterizes Carnot’s work as being based not so much on physics and experiment, but on the “strictest principles of philosophy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img14.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img14.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He doesn’t immediately mention “caloric” (though it does slip in later), referring instead to a vaguer concept of “thermal agency”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img15.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img15.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"84\" /></a></p>\n<p>In keeping with the idea that this is more philosophy than experimental science, he refers to “Carnot’s fundamental principle”—that after a complete cycle an engine can be treated as back in the “same state”—while adding the footnote that “this is tacitly assumed as an axiom”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img16.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img16.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>In actuality, to say that an engine comes back to the same state is a nontrivial statement of the existence of some kind of unique equilibrium in the system, related to the Second Law.

By 1849 a new idea had emerged: that perhaps heat was itself a form of energy, and that, when heat was accounted for, the total energy of a system would always be conserved. And what this suggested was that heat was somehow a dynamical phenomenon, associated with microscopic motion—which in turn suggested that gases might indeed consist just of molecules in motion.</p>\n<p>And so it was that in 1850 Kelvin (then still “William Thomson”) wrote a long exposition “On the Dynamical Theory of Heat”, attempting to reconcile Carnot’s ideas with the new concept that heat was dynamical in origin:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img21.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro20royal/page/260/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img21.png\" width='620' height='635' /></a></p>\n<p>He begins by quoting—presumably for some kind of “British-based authority”—an “anti-caloric” experiment apparently done by <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Humphry+Davy'>Humphry Davy</a> (1778–1829) as a teenager, involving melting pieces of ice by rubbing them together, and included anonymously in a 1799 list of pieces of knowledge “principally from the west of England”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img22.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/contributionsto00beddgoog/page/n8/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img22.png\" width='552' height='414' /></a></p>\n<p>But soon Kelvin is getting to the main point:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img23.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/10/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img23.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then we have it: a statement of the Second Law (albeit with some hedging to which we’ll come back later):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img24.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/12/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img24.png\" width='620' height='126' /></a></p>\n<p>And there’s immediately a footnote that basically asserts the “absurdity” of a Second-Law-violating perpetual motion machine:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img25.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/12/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img25.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But by the next page we find out that Kelvin admits he’s in some sense been “scooped”—by a certain <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Clausius/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Rudolf Clausius</a> (1822–1888), who we’ll be discussing soon. But what’s remarkable is that Clausius’s “axiom” turns out to be exactly equivalent to Kelvin’s statement:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img26.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img26.png\" width='620' height='353' /></a></p>\n<p>And what this suggests is that the underlying concept—the Second Law—is something quite robust. And indeed, as Kelvin implies, it’s the main thing that ultimately underlies Carnot’s results. And so even though Carnot is operating on the now-outmoded idea of caloric theory, his main results are still correct, because in the end all they really depend on is a certain amount of “logical structure”, together with the Second Law (and a version of the First Law, but that’s a slightly trickier story).</p>\n<p>Kelvin recognized, though, that Carnot had chosen to look at the particular (“equilibrium thermodynamics”) case of processes that occur reversibly, effectively at an infinitesimal rate. And at the end of the first installment of his exposition, he explains that things will be more complicated if finite rates are considered—and that in particular the results one gets in such cases will depend on things like having a correct model for the nature of heat.</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s exposition on the “dynamical nature of heat” runs to four installments, and the next two dive into detailed derivations and attempted comparison with experiment:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img27.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/174/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img27.png\" width='538' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But before Kelvin gets to publish part four of his exposition he publishes two other pieces. In the first, he’s talking about sources of energy for human use (now that he believes energy is conserved):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img28.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy03roya/page/108/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img28.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He emphasizes that the Sun is—directly or indirectly—the main source of energy on Earth (later he’ll argue that coal will run out, etc.):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img29.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy03roya/page/112/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img29.png\" width='620' height='326' /></a></p>\n<p>But he wonders how animals actually manage to produce mechanical work, noting that “the animal body does not act as a thermo-dynamic engine; and [it is] very probable that the chemical forces produce the external mechanical effects through electrical means”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img30.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy03roya/page/112/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img30.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then, by April 1852, he’s back to thinking directly about the Second Law, and he’s cut through the technicalities, and is stating the Second Law in everyday (if slightly ponderous) terms:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img31.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/304/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img31.png\" width='620' height='878' /><a></p>\n<p>It’s interesting to see his apparently rather deeply held Presbyterian beliefs manifest themselves here in his mention that “Creative Power” is what must set the total energy of the universe. He ends his piece with:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img32.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/306/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img32.png\" width='620' height='350' /></a></p>\n<p>In (2) the hedging is interesting. He makes the definitive assertion that what amounts to a violation of the Second Law “is impossible in inanimate material processes”. And he’s pretty sure the same is true for “vegetable life” (recognizing that in his previous paper he discussed the harvesting of sunlight by plants). But what about “animal life”, like us humans? Here he says that “by our will” we can’t violate the Second Law—so we can’t, for example, build a machine to do it. But he leaves it open whether we as humans might have some innate (“God-given”?) ability to overcome the Second Law. </p>\n<p>And then there’s his (3). It’s worth realizing that his whole paper is less than 3 pages long, and right before his conclusions we’re seeing triple integrals: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img33.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/306/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img33.png\" width='620' height='313' /></a></p>\n<p>So what is (3) about? It’s presumably something like a Second-Law-implies-heat-death-of-the-universe statement (but what’s this stuff about the past?)—but with an added twist that there’s something (God?) beyond the “known operations going on at present in the material world” that might be able to swoop in to save the world for us humans.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take people long to pick up on the “cosmic significance” of all this. But in the fall of 1852, Kelvin’s colleague, the Glasgow engineering professor <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Rankine/' target=_blank rel=noopener>William Rankine</a> (1820–1872) (who was deeply involved with the First Law of thermodynamics), is writing about a way the universe might save itself:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img34.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/358/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img34.png\" width='620' height='230' /></a></p>\n<p>After touting the increasingly solid evidence for energy conservation and the First Law</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img35.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/358/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img35.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n<p>he goes on to talk about dissipation of energy and what we now call the Second Law</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img36.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/358/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img36.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"291\" /></a></p>\n<p>and the fact that it implies an “end of all physical phenomena”, i.e. heat death of the universe.

He believes that there must exist a “medium capable of transmitting light and heat”, i.e. an aether, “[between] the heavenly bodies”. And if this aether can’t itself acquire heat, he concludes that all energy must be converted into a radiant form:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img38.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/360/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img38.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now he supposes that the universe is effectively a giant drop of aether, with nothing outside, so that all this radiant energy will get totally internally reflected from its surface, allowing the universe to “[reconcentrate] its physical energies, and [renew] its activity and life”—and save it from heat death:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img39.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/360/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img39.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"496\" /></a></p>\n<p>He ends with the speculation that perhaps “some of the luminous objects which we see in distant regions of space may be, not stars, but foci in the interstellar aether”.</p>\n<p>But independent of cosmic speculations, Kelvin himself continues to study the “dynamical theory of gases”. It’s often a bit unclear what’s being assumed. There’s the First Law (energy conservation). And the Second Law. But there’s also reversibility. Equilibrium. And the ideal gas law (<em>P V</em> = <em>R T</em>). But it soon becomes clear that that’s not always correct for real gases—as the Joule–Thomson effect demonstrates: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img40.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/480/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img40.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kelvin soon returned to more cosmic speculations, suggesting that perhaps gravitation—rather than direct “Creative Power”—might “in reality [be] the ultimate created antecedent of all motion&#8230;”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img41.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/report47sciegoog/page/58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img41.png\" width='620' height='228' /></a></p>\n<p>Not long after these papers Kelvin got involved with the practical “electrical” problem of laying a transatlantic telegraph cable, and in 1858 was on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable' target=_blank rel=noopener>the ship that first succeeded in doing this</a>.

But he continued to write physics papers, which ranged over many different areas, occasionally touching thermodynamics, though most often in the service of answering a “general science” question—like <a href='https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro21royal/page/78/mode/2up?q=32' target=_blank rel=noopener>how old the Sun is</a> (he estimated 32,000 years from thermodynamic arguments, though of course without knowledge of nuclear reactions).</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s ideas about the inevitable dissipation of “useful energy” spread quickly—by 1854, for example, finding their way into an eloquent public lecture by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Helmholtz/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Hermann von Helmholtz</a> (1821–1894). Helmholtz had trained as a doctor, becoming in 1843 a surgeon to a German military regiment. But he was also doing experiments and developing theories about “animal heat” and how muscles manage to “do mechanical work”, for example publishing an 1845 paper entitled “<a href='https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/50072#page/302/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On Metabolism during Muscular Activity</a>”. And in 1847 he was one of the inventors of the law of conservation of energy—and the First Law of thermodynamics—as well as perhaps its clearest expositor at the time (the word “force” in the title is what we now call “energy”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img42.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_qu44AAAAMAAJ/page/n3/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img42.png\" width='620' height='745' /></a></p>\n<p>By 1854 Helmholtz was a physiology professor, beginning a distinguished career in physics, psychophysics and physiology—and talking about the Second Law and its implications.

But let&#8217;s turn now to Rudolf Clausius, who in 1850 at least to some extent &#8220;scooped&#8221; Kelvin on the Second Law. At that time Clausius was a freshly minted German physics PhD. His thesis had been on an ingenious but <a href='https://archive.org/details/journalfrdierei109crelgoog/page/n129/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>ultimately incorrect theory of why the sky is blue</a>. But he&#8217;d also <a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1849_76_1/page/46/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>worked on elasticity theory</a>, and there he&#8217;d been led to start thinking about molecules and their configurations in materials. By 1850 caloric theory had become fairly elaborate, complete with concepts like &#8220;latent heat&#8221; (bound to molecules) and &#8220;free heat&#8221; (able to be transferred). Clausius&#8217;s experience in elasticity theory made him skeptical, and knowing Mayer&#8217;s and Joule&#8217;s results he decided to break with the caloric theory—writing his career-launching paper (translated from German in 1851, with Carnot&#8217;s <em>puissance motrice</em> [&#8220;motive power&#8221;] being rendered as &#8220;moving force&#8221;):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img50.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghd02lond/page/n13/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img50.png\" alt='' title='' width='550' height='435' /></a></p>\n<p>The first installment of the English version of the paper gives a clear description of the ideal gas laws and the Carnot cycle, having started from a statement of the “caloric-busting” First Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img51.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghd02lond/page/4/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img51.png\" width='550' height='285' /></a></p>\n<p>The general discussion continues in the second installment, but now there’s a critical side comment that describes the “general deportment of heat, which every-where exhibits the tendency to annul differences of temperature, and therefore to pass from a warmer body to a colder one”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img52.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghd02lond/page/102/mode/2up?q=clausius&#038;view=theater\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img52.png\" width='550' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Clausius “has” the Second Law, as Carnot basically did before him. But when Kelvin quotes Clausius he does so much more forcefully:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img53.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img53.png\" width='620' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>But there it is: by 1852 the Second Law is out in the open, in at least two different forms. The path to reach it has been circuitous and quite technical. But in the end, stripped of its technical origins, the law seems somehow unsurprising and even obvious. For it’s a matter of common experience that heat flows from hotter bodies to colder ones, and that motion is dissipated by friction into heat. But the point is that it wasn’t until basically 1850 that the overall scientific framework existed to make it useful—or even really possible—to enunciate such observations as a formal scientific law.</p>\n<p>Of course the fact that a law “seems true” based on common experience doesn’t mean it’ll always be true, and that there won’t be some special circumstance or elaborate construction that will evade it. But somehow the very fact that the Second Law had in a sense been “technically hard won”—yet in the end seemed so “obvious”—appears to have given it a sense of inevitability and certainty. And it didn’t hurt that somehow it seemed to have emerged from Carnot’s work, which had a certain air of “logical necessity”. (Of course, in reality, the Second Law entered Carnot’s logical structure as an “axiom”.) But all this helped set the stage for some of the curious confusions about the Second Law that would develop over the century that followed.</p>\n<p><!--Section 5 The Concept of Entropy--></p>\n<h2 id='the-concept-of-entropy'>The Concept of Entropy</h2>\n<p>In the first half of the 1850s the Second Law had in a sense been presented in two ways. First, as an almost “footnote-style” assumption needed to support the “pure thermodynamics” that had grown out of Carnot’s work. And second, as an explicitly-stated-for-the-first-time—if “obvious”—“everyday” feature of nature, that was now realized as having potentially cosmic significance. But an important feature of the decade that followed was a certain progressive at-least-phenomenological “mathematicization” of the Second Law—pursued most notably by Rudolf Clausius.</p>\n<p>In 1854 Clausius was already beginning this process. Perhaps confusingly, he refers to the Second Law as the &#8220;second fundamental theorem [<em>Hauptsatz</em>]&#8221; in the &#8220;mechanical theory of heat&#8221;—suggesting it&#8217;s something that is proved, even though it&#8217;s really introduced just as an empirical law of nature, or perhaps a theoretical axiom:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img54.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n131/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img54.png\" width='580' height='458' /></a></p>\n<p>He starts off by discussing the “first fundamental theorem”, i.e. the First Law. And he emphasizes that this implies that there’s a quantity <em>U</em> (which we now call “internal energy”) that is a pure “function of state”—so that its value depends only on the state of a system, and not the path by which that state was reached. And as an “application” of this, he then points out that the overall change in <em>U</em> in a cyclic process (like the one executed by Carnot’s heat engine) must be zero.</p>\n<p>And now he’s ready to tackle the Second Law. He gives a statement that at first seems somewhat convoluted:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img55.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n137/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img55.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But soon he’s deriving this from a more “everyday” statement of the Second Law (which, notably, is clearly not a “theorem” in any normal sense):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img56.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n137/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img56.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>After giving a Carnot-style argument he’s then got a new statement (that he calls “the theorem of the equivalence of transformations”) of the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img57.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n145/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img57.png\" width='580' height='365' /></a></p>\n<p>And there it is: basically what we now call entropy (even with the same notation of <em>Q</em> for heat and <em>T</em> for temperature)—together with the statement that this quantity is a function of state, so that its differences are “independent of the nature of the process by which the transformation is effected”.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon there’s a familiar expression for entropy change:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img58.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n147/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img58.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And by the next page he’s giving what he describes as “the analytical expression” of the Second Law, for the particular case of reversible cyclic processes:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img59.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n149/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img59.png\" width='580' height='142' /></a></p>\n<p>A bit later he backs out of the assumption of reversibility, concluding that:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img60.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n153/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img60.png\" width='580' height='48' /></a></p>\n<p>(And, yes, with modern mathematical rigor, that should be “non-negative” rather than “positive”.)</p>\n<p>He goes on to say that if something has changed after going around a cycle, he’ll call that an “uncompensated transformation”—or what we would now refer to as an irreversible change. He lists a few possible (now very familiar) examples:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img61.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n153/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img61.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"211\" /></a></p>\n<p>Earlier in his paper he’s careful to say that <em>T</em> is “a function of temperature”; he doesn’t say it’s actually the quantity we measure as temperature. But now he wants to determine what it is:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img62.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n155/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img62.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He doesn’t talk about the ultimately critical assumption (effectively the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Zeroth+Law+of+Thermodynamics'>Zeroth Law of thermodynamics</a>) that the system is “in equilibrium”, with a uniform temperature. But he uses an ideal gas as a kind of “standard material”, and determines that, yes, in that case <em>T</em> can be simply the absolute temperature.</p>\n<p>So there it is: in 1854 Clausius has effectively defined entropy and described its relation to the Second Law, though everything is being done in a very “heat-engine” style. And pretty soon he’s writing about “Theory of the Steam-Engine” and filling actual approximate steam tables into his theoretical formulas:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img63.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/s4philosophicalmag12londuoft/page/240/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img63.png\" width='620' height='528' /></a></p>\n<p>After a few years “off” (working, as we’ll discuss later, on the kinetic theory of gases) Clausius is back in 1862 talking about the Second Law again, in terms of his “theorem of the equivalence of transformations”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img64.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/72/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img64.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He’s slightly tightened up his 1854 discussion, but, more importantly, he’s now stating a result not just for reversible cyclic processes, but for general ones:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img65.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/76/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img65.png\" width='580' height='357' /></a></p>\n<p>But what does this result really mean? Clausius claims that this “theorem admits of strict mathematical proof if we start from the fundamental proposition above quoted”—though it’s not particularly clear just what that proposition is. But then he says he wants to find a “physical cause”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img66.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/76/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img66.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>A little earlier in the paper he said:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img67.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/74/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img67.png\" width='580' height='214' /></a></p>\n<p>So what does he think the “physical cause” is? He says that even from his first investigations he’d assumed a general law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img68.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/78/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img68.png\" width='580' height='86' /></a></p>\n<p>What are these “resistances”? He’s basically saying they are the forces between molecules in a material (which from his work on the kinetic theory of gases he now imagines exist):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img69.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/78/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img69.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He introduces what he calls the “disgregation” to represent the microscopic effect of adding heat:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img1.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/78/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img1.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>For ideal gases things are straightforward, including the proportionality of “resistance” to absolute temperature. But in other cases, it’s not so clear what’s going on. A decade later he identifies “disgregation” with average kinetic energy per molecule—which is indeed proportional to absolute temperature. But in 1862 it’s all still quite muddy, with somewhat curious statements like:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img70.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/100/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img70.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then the main part of the paper ends with what seems to be an anticipation of the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Third+Law+of+Thermodynamics'>Third Law of thermodynamics</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img71.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/112/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img71.png\" alt='' title='' width='580' height='139' /></a></p>\n<p>There’s an appendix entitled “On Terminology” which admits that between Clausius’s own work, and other people’s, it’s become rather difficult to follow what’s going on. He agrees that the term “energy” that Kelvin is using makes sense. He suggests “energy of the body” for what he calls <em>U</em> and we now call “internal energy”. He suggests “heat of the body” or “thermal content of the body” for <em>Q</em>. But then he talks about the fact that these are measured in thermal units (say the amount of heat needed to increase the temperature of water by 1°), while mechanical work is measured in units related to kilograms and meters.

Or was it something more dynamical, and in a sense more abstract? But then we saw how Carnot—followed by Kelvin and Clausius—managed in effect to sidestep the question, and come up with all sorts of “thermodynamic conclusions”, by talking just about “what heat does” without ever really having to seriously address the question of “what heat is”. But to be able to discuss the foundations of the Second Law—and what it says about heat—we have to know more about what heat actually is. And the crucial development that began to clarify the nature of heat was the kinetic theory of gases.</p>\n<p>Central to the kinetic theory of gases is the idea that gases are made up of discrete molecules. And it’s important to remember that it wasn’t until the beginning of the 1900s that anyone knew for sure that molecules existed. Yes, something like them had been discussed ever since antiquity, and in the 1800s there was increasing “circumstantial evidence” for them. But nobody had directly “seen a molecule”, or been able, for example, until about 1870, to even guess what the size of molecules might be. Still, by the mid-1800s it had become common for physicists to talk and reason in terms of ordinary matter at least effectively being made of up molecules.</p>\n<p>But if a gas was made of molecules bouncing off each other like billiard balls according to the laws of mechanics, what would its overall properties be? <a href=\"https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Daniel/\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Daniel Bernoulli</a> had in 1738 already worked out the basic answer that pressure would vary inversely with volume, or in his notation, π = <em>P</em>/<em>s</em> (and he even also gave formulas for molecules of nonzero size—in a precursor of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>van der Waals</a>): </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img79.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_3yRVAAAAcAAJ/page/n215/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img79.png\" width='492' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Results like Bernouilli’s would be rediscovered several times, for example in 1820 by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herapath' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Herapath</a> (1790–1868), a math teacher in England, who developed a fairly elaborate theory that purported to describe gravity as well as heat (but for example implied a <em>P V</em> = <em>a T</em><sup>2</sup> gas law):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img80.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/annalsofphilosop01lond/page/400/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img80.png\" width='568' height='76' /></a></p>\n<p>Then there was the case of <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Waterston/' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Waterston</a> (1811–1883), a naval instructor for the East India company, who in 1843 published a book called <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/b29487468/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Thoughts on the Mental Functions</a></em>, which included results on what he called the “<em>vis viva</em> theory of heat”—that he developed in more detail in a paper he wrote in 1846. But when he submitted the paper to the Royal Society it was rejected as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, and its manuscript was &#8220;lost&#8221; until 1891 when it was finally published (with an “explanation” of the “delay”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img81.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/philtrans04661231\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img81.png\" width='604' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The paper had included a perfectly sensible mathematical analysis that included a derivation of the kinetic theory relation between pressure and mean-square molecular velocity:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img82.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/philtrans04661231/page/n41/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img82.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='604' height='391' /></a></p>\n<p>But with all these pieces of work unknown, it fell to a German high-school chemistry teacher (and sometime professor and <a href='https://books.google.com/books/about/Das_dasein_Gottes_und_das_Gl%C3%BCck_der_Men.html?id=pcBgAAAAcAAJ' target=_blank rel=noopener>philosophical/theological writer</a>) named <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=August+Kr%C3%B6nig'>August Krönig</a> (1822–1879) to publish in 1856 yet another “rediscovery”, that he entitled “Principles of a Theory of Gases”. He said it was going to analyze the “mechanical theory of heat”, and once again he wanted to compute the pressure associated with colliding molecules. But to simplify the math, he assumed that molecules went only along the coordinate directions, at a fixed speed—almost anticipating a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-road-from-ordinary-thermodynamics'>cellular automaton fluid</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img83.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1856_99_10/page/314/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img83.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='520' height='1104' /></a></p>\n<p>What ultimately launched the subsequent development of the kinetic theory of gases, however, was the 1857 publication by Rudolf Clausius (by then an increasingly established German physics professor) of a paper entitled rather poetically “<a href='https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp14maga/page/108/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Nature of the Motion Which We Call Heat</a>” (“<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1857_100_3/mode/2up\" rel=noopener>Über die Art der Bewegung die wir Wärme nennen</a>”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img84.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp14maga/page/108/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img84.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='620' height='569' /></a></p>\n<p>It’s a clean and clear paper, with none of the mathematical muddiness around Clausius’s work on the Second Law (which, by the way, isn’t even mentioned in this paper even though Clausius had recently worked on it).

For some reason, Maxwell doesn&#8217;t want to think of molecules, as he did before, as hard spheres.

In 1871, a few years before he died at age 48, he wrote a textbook entitled <em><a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Theory of Heat</a></em>, which begins, in erudite fashion, discussing what &#8220;thermodynamics&#8221; should even be called:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img116.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=22\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img116.png\" width='550' height='142' /></a></p>\n<p>Most of the book is concerned with the macroscopic &#8220;theory of heat&#8221;—though, as we&#8217;ll discuss later, in the very last chapter Maxwell does talk about the &#8220;molecular theory&#8221;, if in somewhat tentative terms.</p>\n<p><!--Section 7 \"Deriving\" the Second Law from Molecular Dynamics--></p>\n<h2 id='deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>&#8220;Deriving&#8221; the Second Law from Molecular Dynamics</h2>\n<p>The Second Law was in effect originally introduced as a formalization of everyday observations about heat. But the development of kinetic theory seemed to open up the possibility that the Second Law could actually be proved from the underlying mechanics of molecules. And this was something that <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boltzmann/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ludwig Boltzmann</a> (1844–1906) embarked on towards the end of his physics PhD at the University of Vienna. In 1865 he’d published his first paper (“<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=15%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-19' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Movement of Electricity on Curved Surfaces</a>”), and in 1866 he published his second paper, “On the Mechanical Meaning of the Second Law of Thermodynamics”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img117.png\" data-url=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=23%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-27\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img117.png\" width='548' height='194' /></a></p>\n<p>The introduction promises “a purely analytical, perfectly general proof of the Second Law”. And what he seemed to imagine was that the equations of mechanics would somehow inevitably lead to motion that would reproduce the Second Law. And in a sense what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>computational irreducibility, rule 30, etc. now show</a> is that in the end that’s indeed basically how things work. But the methods and conceptual framework that Boltzmann had at his disposal were very far away from being able to see that. And instead what Boltzmann did was to use standard mathematical methods from mechanics to compute average properties of cyclic mechanical motions—and then made the somewhat unconvincing claim that combinations of these averages could be related (e.g. via temperature as average kinetic energy) to “Clausius’s entropy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img118.png\" data-url=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=43%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-49\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img118.png\" width=\"565\" height=\"194\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s not clear how much this paper was read, but in 1871 Boltzmann (now a professor of mathematical physics in Graz) published another paper entitled simply “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=242%3Bownerid=13510798885806543-250' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Priority of Finding the Relationship between the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Principle of Least Action</a>” that claimed (with some justification) that Clausius’s then-newly-announced virial theorem was already contained in Boltzmann’s 1866 paper.</p>\n<p>But back in 1868—instead of trying to get all the way to Clausius’s entropy—Boltzmann instead uses mechanics to get a generalization of Maxwell’s law for the distribution of molecular velocities. His paper “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=63%3Bownerid=13510798885806543-67' target=_blank rel=noopener>Studies on the Equilibrium of [Kinetic Energy] between [Point Masses] in Motion</a>” opens by saying that while analytical mechanics has in effect successfully studied the evolution of mechanical systems “from a given state to another”, it’s had little to say about what happens when such systems “have been left moving on their own for a long time”. He intends to remedy that, and spends 47 pages—complete with elaborate diagrams and formulas about collisions between hard spheres—in deriving an exponential distribution of energies if one assumes “equilibrium” (or, more specifically, balance between forward and backward processes):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img119.png\" data-url=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=63%3Bownerid=13510798885806543-67\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img119.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s notable that one of the mathematical approaches Boltzmann uses is to discretize (i.e. effectively quantize) things, then look at the &#8220;combinatorial&#8221; limit.  (Based on his later statements, he didn&#8217;t want to trust &#8220;purely continuous&#8221; mathematics—at least in the context of discrete molecular processes—and wanted to explicitly &#8220;watch the limits happening&#8221;.) But in the end it&#8217;s not clear that Boltzmann&#8217;s 1868 arguments do more than the few-line functional-equation approach that Maxwell had already used. (Maxwell would <a href='https://archive.org/details/scientificletter0000maxw/page/914/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>later complain about Boltzmann’s “overly long” arguments</a>.)</p>\n<p>Boltzmann’s 1868 paper had derived what the distribution of molecular energies should be “in equilibrium”. (In 1871 he was talking about “equipartition” not just of kinetic energy, but also of energies associated with “internal motion” of polyatomic molecules.) But what about the approach to equilibrium? How would an initial distribution of molecular energies evolve over time? And would it always end up at the exponential (“Maxwell–Boltzmann”) distribution? These are questions deeply related to a microscopic understanding of the Second Law. And they’re what Boltzmann addressed in 1872 in his 22nd published paper “Further Studies on the Thermal Equilibrium of Gas Molecules”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img120.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/274/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img120.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/276/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>explains that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Maxwell already found the value <em>Av</em><sup>2</sup> <em>e</em><sup>&#8211;<em>Bv</em><sup>2</sup></sup> [for the distribution of velocities] &#8230; so that the probability of different velocities is given by a formula similar to that for the probability of different errors of observation in the theory of the method of least squares. The first proof which Maxwell gave for this formula was recognized to be incorrect even by himself. He later gave a very elegant proof that, if the above distribution has once been established, it will not be changed by collisions. He also tries to prove that it is the only velocity distribution that has this property. But the latter proof appears to me to contain a false inference. It has still not yet been proved that, whatever the initial state of the gas may be, it must always approach the limit found by Maxwell. It is possible that there may be other possible limits. This proof is easily obtained, however, by the method which I am about to explain&#8230; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(He gives a long footnote explaining why Maxwell might be wrong, talking about how a sequence of collisions might lead to a “cycle of velocity states”—which Maxwell hasn’t proved will be traversed with equal probability in each direction. Ironically, this is actually already an analog of where things are going to go wrong with Boltzmann’s own argument.)</p>\n<p>The main idea of Boltzmann’s paper is not to assume equilibrium, but instead to write down an equation (now called the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation' target=_blank rel=noopener>Boltzmann Transport Equation</a>) that explicitly describes how the velocity (or energy) distribution of molecules will change as a result of collisions.

In other words, he is saying that he’s proved that a gas will always (“monotonically”) approach equilibrium—which seems awfully like some kind of microscopic proof of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>But then Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/306/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>makes a bolder claim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">It has thus been rigorously proved that, whatever the initial distribution of kinetic energy may be, in the course of a very long time it must always necessarily approach the one found by Maxwell. The procedure used so far is of course nothing more than a mathematical artifice employed in order to give a rigorous proof of a theorem whose exact proof has not previously been found. It gains meaning by its applicability to the theory of polyatomic gas molecules. There one can again prove that a certain quantity <em>E</em> can only decrease as a consequence of molecular motion, or in a limiting case can remain constant. One can also prove that for the atomic motion of a system of arbitrarily many material points there always exists a certain quantity which, in consequence of any atomic motion, cannot increase, and this quantity agrees up to a constant factor with the value found for the well-known integral ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> in my [1871] paper on the “Analytical proof of the 2nd law, etc.”. We have therefore prepared the way for an analytical proof of the Second Law in a completely different way from those previously investigated. Up to now the object has been to show that ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> = 0 for reversible cyclic processes, but it has not been proved analytically that this quantity is always negative for irreversible processes, which are the only ones that occur in nature. The reversible cyclic process is only an ideal, which one can more or less closely approach but never completely attain. Here, however, we have succeeded in showing that ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> is in general negative, and is equal to zero only for the limiting case, which is of course the reversible cyclic process (since if one can go through the process in either direction, ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> cannot be negative).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, he’s saying that the quantity <em>H</em> that he’s defined microscopically in terms of velocity distributions can be identified (up to a sign) with the entropy that Clausius defined as <em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em>. He says that he’ll show this in the context of analyzing the mechanics of polyatomic molecules. </p>\n<p>But first he’s going to take a break and show that his derivation doesn’t need to assume continuity. In a pre-quantum-mechanics pre-cellular-automaton-fluid kind of way he replaces all the integrals by limits of sums of discrete quantities (i.e. he’s quantizing kinetic energy, etc.):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img126.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/308/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img126.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He says that this discrete approach makes everything clearer, and quotes Lagrange’s derivation of vibrations of a string as an example of where this has happened before. But then he argues that everything works out fine with the discrete approach, and that <em>H</em> still decreases, with the Maxwell distribution as the only possible end point. As an aside, he makes a jab at Maxwell’s derivation, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/306/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>pointing out that</a> with Maxwell’s functional equation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; there are infinitely many other solutions, which are not useful however since &fnof;(<em>x</em>) comes out negative or imaginary for some values of <em>x</em>. Hence, it follows very clearly that Maxwell’s attempt to prove <em>a priori</em> that his solution is the only one must fail, since it is not the only one but rather it is the only one that gives purely positive probabilities, and therefore the only useful one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But finally—after another aside about computing thermal conductivities of gases—Boltzmann digs into polyatomic molecules, and his claim about <em>H</em> being related to entropy. There’s another 26 pages of calculations, and then we get to a section entitled “Solution of Equation (81) and Calculation of Entropy”. More pages of calculation about polyatomic molecules ensue. But finally we’re computing <em>H</em>, and, yes, it agrees with the Clausius result—but anticlimactically he’s only dealing with the case of equilibrium for monatomic molecules, where we already knew we got the Maxwell distribution:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img128.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/366/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img128.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And now he decides he’s not talking about polyatomic molecules anymore, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/368/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>and instead</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In order to find the relation of the quantity [<em>H</em>] to the second law of thermodynamics in the form ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> < 0, we shall interpret the\nsystem of mass points not, as previously, as a gas molecule, but rather as an entire body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then, in the last couple of pages of his paper, Boltzmann pulls out another idea. He’s discussed the concept that polyatomic molecules (or, now, whole systems) can be in many different configurations, or “phases”. But now he says: “We shall replace [our] single system by a large number of equivalent systems distributed over many different phases, but which do not interact with each other”. In other words, he’s introducing the idea of an ensemble of states of a system. And now he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/368\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a> instead of looking at the distribution just for a single velocity, we should do it for all velocities, i.e. for the whole “phase” of the system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">[These distributions] may be discontinuous, so that they have large values when the variables are very close to certain values determined by one or more equations, and otherwise vanishingly small. We may choose these equations to be those that characterize visible external motion of the body and the kinetic energy contained in it. In this connection it should be noted that the kinetic energy of visible motion corresponds to such a large deviation from the final equilibrium distribution of kinetic energy<br />\nthat it leads to an infinity in <em>H</em>, so that from the point of view of the Second Law of thermodynamics it acts like heat supplied from an infinite temperature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a bunch of ideas swirling around here. Phase-space density (<em>cf</em>. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Liouville&#8217;s equation</a>). Coarse-grained variables. Microscopic representation of mechanical work. Etc. But the paper is ending. There’s a discussion about <em>H</em> for systems that interact, and how there’s an equilibrium value achieved. And finally there’s a formula for entropy</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img129.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/370/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img129.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>that Boltzmann said “agrees &#8230; with the expression I found in my previous [1871] paper”. </p>\n<p>So what exactly did Boltzmann really do in his 1872 paper? He introduced the Boltzmann Transport Equation which allows one to compute at least certain non-equilibrium properties of gases. But is his &fnof; log &fnof; quantity really what we can call “entropy” in the sense Clausius meant? And is it true that he’s proved that entropy (even in his sense) increases? A century and a half later there’s still a remarkable level of confusion around both these issues. </p>\n<p>But in any case, back in 1872 Boltzmann’s “minimum theorem” (now called his “<em>H</em> theorem”) created quite a stir. But after some time there was an objection raised, which we’ll discuss below. And partly in response to this, Boltzmann (after spending time working on microscopic models of electrical properties of materials—as well as doing some actual experiments) wrote another major paper on entropy and the Second Law in 1877:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img130.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA373&#038;lpg=PA373#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img130.png\" width='494' height='197' /></a></p>\n<p>The translated title of the paper is “On the Relation between the Second Law of Thermodynamics and Probability Theory with Respect to the Laws of Thermal Equilibrium”. And at the very beginning of the paper Boltzmann makes a statement that was pivotal for future discussions of the Second Law: he says it’s now clear to him that an “analytical proof” of the Second Law is “only possible on the basis of probability calculations”. Now that we know about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>computational irreducibility and its implications</a> one could say that this was the point where Boltzmann and those who followed him went off track in understanding the true foundations of the Second Law.

(Note that Boltzmann’s Ω isn’t the modern total-number-of-states Ω; confusingly, that’s essentially the exponential of Boltzmann’s Ω.)</p>\n<p>He goes through some discussion of how to handle extra degrees of freedom in polyatomic molecules, but then he’s on to the main event: arguing that Ω is (essentially) the entropy. It doesn’t take long:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img143.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA427\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img143.png\" width=\"494\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Basically he just says that in equilibrium the probability &fnof;(&#8230;) for a molecule to have a particular velocity is given by the Maxwell distribution, then he substitutes this into the formula for Ω, and shows that indeed, up to a constant, Ω is exactly the “Clausius entropy” ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em>.</p>\n<p>So, yes, in equilibrium Ω seems to be giving the entropy. But then Boltzmann makes a bit of a jump. He <a href=\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=P429\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a> in processes that aren’t reversible both “Clausius entropy” and Ω will increase, and can still be identified—and enunciates the general principle, printed in his paper in special doubled-spaced form:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img144.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA430\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img144.png\" width=\"494\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; [In] any system of bodies that undergoes state changes &#8230; even if the initial and final states are not in thermal equilibrium &#8230; the total permutability measure for the bodies will continually increase during the state changes, and can remain constant only so long as all the bodies during the state changes remain infinitely close to thermal equilibrium (reversible state changes).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, he’s asserting that Ω behaves the same way entropy is said to behave according to the Second Law. He gives various thought experiments about gases in boxes with dividers, gases under gravity, etc. And finally concludes that, yes, the relationship of entropy to Ω “applies to the general case”. </p>\n<p>There’s one <a href=\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=P434\" target=_blank rel=noopener>final paragraph</a> in the paper, though:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Up to this point, these propositions may be demonstrated exactly using the theory of gases. If one tries, however, to generalize to liquid drops and solid bodies, one must dispense with an exact treatment from the outset, since far too little is known about the nature of the latter states of matter, and the mathematical theory is barely developed. But I have already mentioned reasons in previous papers, in virtue of which it is likely that for these two aggregate states, the thermal equilibrium is achieved when Ω becomes a maximum, and that when thermal equilibrium exists, the entropy is given by the same expression. It can therefore be described as likely that the validity of the principle which I have developed is not just limited to gases, but that the same constitutes a general natural law applicable to solid bodies and liquid droplets, although the exact mathematical treatment of these cases still seems to encounter extraordinary difficulties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, Boltzmann is only saying that it’s “likely” that in thermal equilibrium his permutability measure agrees with Clausius’s entropy, and he’s implying that actually that’s really the only place where Clausius’s entropy is properly defined. But certainly his definition is more general (after all, it doesn’t refer to things like temperature that are only properly defined in equilibrium), and so—even though Boltzmann didn’t explicitly say it—one can imagine basically just using it as the definition of entropy for arbitrary cases.

And this was an idea that Boltzmann seems to have had—with increasing clarity—from the time of his very first paper in 1866 that purported to “prove the Second Law” from mechanics. </p>\n<p>In modern times—with our understanding of discrete systems and computational rules—it’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ergodicity-and-global-behavior'>not difficult to describe the idea of &#8220;visiting all states&#8221;</a>. But in Boltzmann’s time it was considerably more complicated. Did one expect to hit all the infinite possible infinitesimally separated configurations of a system? Or somehow just get close? The fact is that Boltzmann had certainly dipped his toe into thinking about things in terms of discrete quantities. But he didn’t make the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>jump to imagining discrete rules</a>, even though he certainly did know about discrete iterative processes, like Newton’s method for finding roots.</p>\n<p>Boltzmann knew about cases—like circular motion—where everything was purely periodic. But maybe when motion wasn&#8217;t periodic, it&#8217;d inevitably &#8220;visit all states&#8221;. Already in 1868 Boltzmann was writing a paper entitled &#8220;<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=111%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-117' target=_blank rel=noopener>Solution to a Mechanical Problem</a>&#8221; where he studies a single point mass moving in an α/<em>r </em>&#8211; β/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> potential and bouncing elastically off a line—and manages to show that it visits every position with equal probability.

Boltzmann used the same potential again, but now with a name for the “visit-all-states” property: isodic. Meanwhile, Boltzmann had introduced the name “ergoden” for the collection of all possible configurations of a system with a given energy (what would now be called the microcanonical ensemble). But somehow, quite a few years later, Boltzmann’s student <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Paul Ehrenfest</a> (1880–1933) (along with <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Tatiana Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa</a> (1876–1964)) would introduce the term “ergodic” for Boltzmann’s isodic. And “ergodic” is the term that caught on. And in the twentieth century there was all sorts of development of “ergodic theory”, as we’ll discuss a bit later.</p>\n<p>But back in the 1800s people continued to discuss the possibility that what would become called ergodicity was somehow generic, and would explain why all states would somehow be equally probable, why the Maxwell distribution of velocities would be obtained, and ultimately why the Second Law was true. Maxwell worked out some examples. <a href='https://archive.org/details/philtrans00187939/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>So did Kelvin</a>. But it remained unclear how it would all work out, as Kelvin (now with many letters after his name) discussed in a talk he gave in 1900 celebrating the new century:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img150.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburgh621901lond/page/n11/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img150.png\" width='516' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The dynamical theory of light didn’t work out.

One skeptic was Boltzmann’s friend and former teacher, the chemist <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Josef+Loschmidt'>Josef Loschmidt</a> (1821–1895), who in 1866 had used kinetic theory to (rather accurately) estimate the size of air molecules.

The underlying molecular equations of motion that Boltzmann had assumed in his proof were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-2--the-notion-of-reversibility'>reversible in time</a>. Yet Boltzmann claimed that <em>H</em> was always going to a minimum. But why couldn’t one use Loschmidt’s argument to construct an equally possible “reverse evolution” in which <em>H</em> was instead going to a maximum?</p>\n<p>It didn’t take Boltzmann long to answer, in print, tucked away in a section of his paper “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012336965?urlappend=%3Bseq=126%3Bownerid=13510798885803827-128' target=_blank rel=noopener>Remarks on Some Problems in the Mechanical Theory of Heat</a>”. He admits that Loschmidt’s argument “has great seductiveness”. But he claims it is merely “an interesting sophism”—and then says he will “locate the source of the fallacy”.

Now he imagines (following Loschmidt) reversing all the velocities in this state at time <em>t</em>. Then, he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=134\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; the spheres would sort themselves out as time progresses, and at [the analog of] time 0, they would have a completely nonuniform distribution, even though the [new] initial distribution [one had used] was almost uniform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But now he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=134\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a>, yes—given this counterexample—it won’t be possible to prove that the final distribution of spheres will always be uniform.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">This is in fact a consequence of probability theory, for any nonuniform distribution, no matter how improbable it may be, is still not absolutely impossible. Indeed it is clear that any individual uniform distribution, which might arise after a certain time from some particular initial state, is just as improbable as an individual nonuniform distribution; just as in the game of Lotto, any individual set of five numbers is as improbable as the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It is only because there are many more uniform distributions than nonuniform ones that the distribution of states will become uniform in the course of time. One therefore cannot prove that, whatever may be the positions and velocities of the spheres at the beginning, the distribution must become uniform after a long time; rather one can only prove that infinitely many more initial states will lead to a uniform one after a definite length of time than to a nonuniform one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=135\" target=_blank rel=noopener>adds</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">One could even calculate, from the relative numbers of the different state distributions, their probabilities, which might lead to an interesting method for the calculation of thermal equilibrium.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And indeed within a few months Boltzmann has followed up on that “interesting method” to produce his classic paper on the probabilistic interpretation of entropy.</p>\n<p>But in his earlier paper he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp \\\n.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=135\" target=_blank rel=noopener>goes on to argue</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Since there are infinitely many more uniform than nonuniform distributions of states, the latter case is extraordinarily improbable [to arise] and can be considered impossible for practical purposes; just as it may be considered impossible that if one starts with oxygen and nitrogen mixed in a container, after a month one will find chemically pure oxygen in the lower half and nitrogen in the upper half, although according to probability theory this is merely very improbable but not impossible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He talks about how interesting it is that the Second Law is intimately connected with probability while the First Law is not. But at the end he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=136\" target=_blank rel=noopener>does admit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Perhaps this reduction of the Second Law to the realm of probability makes its application to the entire universe appear dubious, but the laws of probability theory are confirmed by all experiments carried out in the laboratory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point it’s all rather unconvincing. The <em>H</em> theorem had purported to prove the Second Law. But now he’s just talking about probability theory. He seems to have given up on proving the Second Law. And he’s basically just saying that the Second Law is true because it’s observed to be true—like other laws of nature, but not like something that can be “proved”, say from underlying molecular dynamics.</p>\n<p>For many years not much attention was paid to these issues, but by the late 1880s there were <a href='https://archive.org/details/londonedinburgh5301890lon/page/94/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>attempts to clarify things</a>, particularly among the rather active British circle of kinetic theorists.

In essence what it’s saying is that, yes, the Second Law implies that the universe will end up in thermal equilibrium. But there’ll always be fluctuations. And in a big enough universe there’ll be fluctuations somewhere that are large enough to correspond to the world as we experience it, where “visible motion and life exist”.</p>\n<p>But regardless of such claims, there’s a purely formal question about the <em>H</em> theorem. How exactly is it that from the Boltzmann transport equation—which is supposed to describe reversible mechanical processes—the <em>H</em> theorem manages to prove that the <em>H</em> function irreversibly decreases? It wasn’t until 1895—fully 25 years after Boltzmann first claimed to prove the <em>H</em> theorem—that this issue was even addressed. And it first came up rather circuitously through Boltzmann’s response to comments in a textbook by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kirchhoff/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Gustav Kirchhoff</a> (1824–1887) that had been completed by Max Planck. </p>\n<p>The key point is that Boltzmann’s equation makes an implicit assumption, that’s essentially the same as Maxwell made back in 1860: that before each collision between molecules, the molecules are statistically uncorrelated, so that the probability for the collision has the factored form &fnof;(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>) &fnof;(<em>v</em><sub>2</sub>). But what about after the collision? Inevitably the collision itself will lead to correlations. So now there’s an asymmetry: there are no correlations before each collision, but there are correlations after. And that’s why the behavior of the system doesn’t have to be symmetrical—and the <em>H</em> theorem can prove that <em>H</em> irreversibly decreases.</p>\n<p>In 1895 Boltzmann wrote a 3-page paper (after half in footnotes) entitled “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337138?urlappend=%3Bseq=552%3Bownerid=13510798885807058-554' target=_blank rel=noopener>More about Maxwell&#8217;s Distribution Law for Speeds</a>” where he explained what he thought was going on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">[The reversibility of the laws of mechanics] has been recently applied in judging the assumptions necessary for a proof of [the <em>H</em> theorem]. This proof requires the hypothesis that the state of the gas is and remains molecularly disordered, namely, that the molecules of a given class do not always or predominantly collide in a specific manner and that, on the contrary, the number of collisions of a given kind can be found by the laws of probability.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Now, if we assume that in general a state distribution never remains molecularly ordered for an unlimited time and also that for a stationary state-distribution every velocity is as probable as the reversed velocity, then it follows that by inversion of all the velocities after an infinitely long time every stationary state-distribution remains unchanged. After the reversal, however, there are exactly as many collisions occurring in the reversed way as there were collisions occurring in the direct way. Since the two state distributions are identical, the probability of direct and indirect collisions must be equal for each of them, whence follows Maxwell’s distribution of velocities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann is introducing what we’d now call the “molecular chaos” assumption (and what Ehrenfest would call the <em>Stosszahlansatz</em>)—giving a rather self-fulfilling argument for why the assumption should be true. In Boltzmann’s time there wasn’t really anything better to do. By the 1940s the BBGKY hierarchy at least let one organize the hierarchy of correlations between molecules—though it still didn’t give one a tractable way to assess what correlations should exist in practice, and what not.</p>\n<p>Boltzmann knew these were all complicated issues. But he wrote about them at a technical level only a few more times in his life. The last time was in 1898 when, responding to a request from the mathematician <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Klein/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Felix Klein</a> (1849–1925), he wrote a paper about the <em>H</em> curve for mathematicians. He begins by saying that although this curve comes from the theory of gases, the essence of it can be reproduced by a process based on accumulating balls randomly picked from an urn. He then goes on to outline what amounts to a story of random walks and fractals. In another paper, he actually sketches the curve</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img167.png\" data-url=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012337138&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=605\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img167.png\" width='464' height='210' /></a></p>\n<p>saying that his drawing “should be taken with a large grain of salt”, noting—in a remarkably fractal-reminiscent way—that “a zincographer [i.e. an engraver of printing plates] would not have been able to produce a real figure since the <em>H</em>-curve has a very large number of maxima and minima on each finite segment, and hence defies representation as a line of continuously changing direction.”</p>\n<p>Of course, in modern times it’s easy to produce an approximation to the <em>H</em> curve according to his prescription:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img168_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img168.png\" alt='' title='' width='595' height='57'> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>But at the end of his “mathematical” paper he comes back to talking about gases. And first he makes the claim that the effective reversibility seen in the <em>H</em> curve will never be seen in actual physical systems because, in essence, there are always perturbations from outside. But then he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012337138&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=657\" target=_blank rel=noopener>ends</a>, in a statement of ultimate reversibility that casts our everyday observation of irreversibility as tautological:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">There is no doubt that it is just as conceivable to have a world in which all natural processes take place in the wrong chronological order. But a person living in this upside-down world would have feelings no different than we do: they would just describe what we call the future as the past and vice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--Section 10 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='the-recurrence-objection'>The Recurrence Objection</h2>\n<p>Probably the single most prominent research topic in mathematical physics in the 1800s was the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/08/when-exactly-will-the-eclipse-happen-a-multimillenium-tale-of-computation/#the-three-body-problem'>three-body problem</a>—of solving for the motion under gravity of three bodies, such as the Earth, Moon and Sun. And in 1890 the French mathematician <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Poincare/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Henri Poincaré</a> (1854–1912) (whose breakout <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-4--three-body-problem/'>work had been on the three-body problem</a>) wrote a paper entitled “On the Three-Body Problem and the Equations of Dynamics” in which, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/actamathematica07lefgoog/page/n18/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>as he said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">It is proved that there are infinitely many ways of choosing the initial conditions such that the system will return infinitely many times as close as one wishes to its initial position. There are also an infinite number of solutions that do not have this property, but it is shown that these unstable solutions can be regarded as “exceptional” and may be said to have zero probability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a mathematical result. But three years later Poincaré <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/revuedemtaphys01pariuoft/page/148/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote what amounted to</a> a philosophy paper entitled “Mechanism and Experience” which expounded on its significance for the Second Law:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In the mechanistic hypothesis, all phenomena must be reversible; for example, the stars might traverse their orbits in the retrograde sense without violating Newton’s law; this would be true for any law of attraction whatever. This is therefore not a fact peculiar to astronomy; reversibility is a necessary consequence of all mechanistic hypotheses.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Experience provides on the contrary a number of irreversible phenomena. For example, if one puts together a warm and a cold body, the former will give up its heat to the latter; the opposite phenomenon never occurs. Not only will the cold body not return to the warm one the heat which it has taken away when it is in direct contact with it; no matter what artifice one may employ, using other intervening bodies, this restitution will be impossible, at least unless the gain thereby realized is compensated by an equivalent or large loss. In other words, if a system of bodies can pass from state A to state B by a certain path, it cannot return from B to A, either by the same path or by a different one. It is this circumstance that one describes by saying that not only is there not direct reversibility, but also there is not even indirect reversibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/revuedemtaphys01pariuoft/page/536/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">A theorem, easy to prove, tells us that a bounded world, governed only by the laws of mechanics, will always pass through a state very close to its initial state. On the other hand, according to accepted experimental laws (if one attributes absolute validity to them, and if one is willing to press their consequences to the extreme), the universe tends toward a certain final state, from which it will never depart. In this final state, which will be a kind of death, all bodies will be at rest at the same temperature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But in fact, he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/revuedemtaphys01pariuoft/page/536/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says</a>, the recurrence theorem shows that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">This state will not be the final death of the universe, but a sort of slumber, from which it will awake after millions of millions of centuries. According to this theory, to see heat pass from a cold body to a warm one &#8230; it will suffice to have a little patience. [And we may] hope that some day the telescope will show us a world in the process of waking up, where the laws of thermodynamics are reversed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By 1903, Poincaré was more strident in his critique of the formalism around the Second Law, writing (in English) in a paper entitled “On Entropy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img169.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/uvresdehenripoin10poin/page/269/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img169.png\" width='602' height='396' /></a></p>\n<p>But back in 1896, Boltzmann and the <em>H</em> theorem had another critic: <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Zermelo/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ernst Zermelo</a> (1871–1953), a recent German math PhD who was then working with Max Planck on applied mathematics—though would soon turn to foundations of mathematics and become the “Z” in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC set theory</a>. Zermelo’s attack on the <em>H</em> theorem began with a paper entitled “<a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1896_57_3/page/484/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On a Theorem of Dynamics and the Mechanical Theory of Heat</a>”. After explaining Poincaré’s recurrence theorem, Zermelo gives some “mathematician-style” conditions (the gas must be in a finite region, must have no infinite energies, etc.), then says that even though there must exist states that would be non-recurrent and could show irreversible behavior, there would necessarily be infinitely more states that “would periodically repeat themselves &#8230; with arbitrarily small variations”. And, he argues, such repetition would affect macroscopic quantities discernable by our senses. He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\\nn247/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In order to retain the general validity of the Second Law, we therefore would have to assume that just those initial states leading to irreversible processes are realized in nature, their small number notwithstanding, while the other ones, whose probability of existence is higher, mathematically speaking, do not actually occur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n251/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>concludes</a> that the Poincaré recurrence phenomenon means that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; it is certainly impossible to carry out a mechanical derivation of the Second Law on the basis of the existing theory without specializing the initial states.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n251/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>responded promptly</a> but quite impatiently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I have pointed out particularly often, and as clearly as I possibly could &#8230; that the Second Law is but a principle of probability theory as far as the molecular-theoretic point of view is concerned. &#8230; While the theorem by Poincaré that Zermelo discusses in the beginning of his paper is of course correct, its application to heat theory is not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n253/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>talks about</a> the <em>H</em> curve, and first makes rather a mathematician-style point about the order of limits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">If we first take the number of gas molecules to be infinite, as was clearly done in [my 1896 proof], and only then let the time grow very large, then, in the vast majority of cases, we obtain a curve asymptotically [always close to zero]. Moreover, as can easily be seen, Poincaré’s theorem is not applicable in this case. If, however, we take the time [span] to be infinitely great and, in contrast, the number of molecules to be very great but not absolutely infinite, then the <em>H</em>-curve has a different character. It almost always runs very close to [zero], but in rare cases it rises above that, in what we shall call a “hump” &#8230; at which significant deviations from the Maxwell velocity distribution can occur &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann then <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n255/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>argues that</a> even if you start “at a hump”, you won’t stay there, and “over an enormously long period of time” you’ll see something infinitely close to “equilibrium behavior”. But, he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; it is [always] possible to reach again a greater hump of the <em>H</em>-curve by further extending the time &#8230; In fact, it is even the case that the original state must return, provided only that we continue to sufficiently extend the time&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n255/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Mr. Zermelo is therefore right in claiming that, mathematically speaking, the motion is periodic. He has by no means succeeded, however, in refuting my theorems, which, in fact, are entirely consistent with this periodicity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After giving arguments about the probabilistic character of his results, and (as we would now say it) the fact that a 1D random walk is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/#are-they-like-random-walks'>certain to repeatedly return to the origin</a>, Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n257/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; we must not conclude that the mechanical approach has to be modified in any way. This conclusion would be justified only if the approach had a consequence that runs contrary to experience. But this would be the case only if Mr. Zermelo were able to prove that the duration of the period within which the old state of the gas must recur in accordance with Poincaré’s theorem has an observable length&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to imagine “a trillion tiny spheres, each with a [certain initial velocity] &#8230; in the one corner of a box” (and by “trillion” he means million million million, or today’s quintillion) and then says that “after a short time the spheres will be distributed fairly evenly in the box”, but the period for a “Poincaré recurrence” in which they all will return to their original corner is “so great that nobody can live to see it happen”. And to make this point more forcefully, Boltzmann has an appendix in which he tries to get an actual approximation to the recurrence time, concluding that its numerical value “has many trillions of digits”. </p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n261/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>concludes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">If we consider heat as a motion of molecules that occurs in accordance with the general equations of mechanics and assume that the arrangement of bodies that we perceive is currently in a highly improbable state, then a theorem follows that is in agreement with the Second Law for all phenomena so far observed.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Of course, this theorem can no longer hold once we observe bodies of so small a scale that they only contain a few molecules.

In fact, certain experiments conducted on very small bodies in gases seem rather to support the assumption, although we are still far from being able to assert its correctness on the basis of experimental proof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n263/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>gives an important caveat</a>—with a small philosophical flourish:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Of course, we cannot expect natural science to answer the question as to why the bodies surrounding us currently exist in a highly improbable state, just as we cannot expect it to answer the question as to why there are any phenomena at all and why they adhere to certain given principles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly—particularly in view of his future efforts in the foundations of mathematics—Zermelo is unconvinced by all of this. And six months later he replies again in print. He admits that a full Poincaré recurrence might take astronomically long, but <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n271/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>notes that</a> (where, by “physical state”, he means one that we perceive):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; we are after all always concerned only with the &#8220;physical state&#8221;, which can be realized by many different combinations, and hence can recur much sooner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zermelo zeroes in on many of the weaknesses in Boltzmann’s arguments, saying that the thing he particularly “contests &#8230; is the analogy that is supposed to exist between the properties of the <em>H</em> curve and the Second Law”. He claims that irreversibility cannot be explained from “mechanical suppositions” without “new physical assumptions”—and in particular <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#why-the-second-law-works'>criteria for choosing appropriate initial states</a>. He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\\nn279/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>ends by saying that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">From the great successes of the kinetic theory of gases in explaining the relationships among states we must not deduce its &#8230; applicability also to temporal processes. &#8230; [For in this case I am] convinced that it necessarily fails in the absence of entirely new assumptions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann replies again—<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n281/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>starting off</a> with the strangely weak argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The Second Law receives a mechanical explanation by virtue of the assumption, which is of course unprovable, that the universe, when considered as a mechanical system, or at least a very extensive part thereof surrounding us, started out in a highly improbable state and still is in such a state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, yes, there’s clearly something missing in the understanding of the Second Law. And even as Zermelo pushes for formal mathematician-style clarity, Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\\nn283/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>responds</a> with physicist-style “reasonable arguments”. There’s lots of rhetoric:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The applicability of the calculus of probabilities to a particular case can of course never be proved with precision. If 100 out of 100,000 objects of a particular sort are consumed by fire per year, then we cannot infer with certainty that this will also be the case next year. On the contrary! If the same conditions continue to obtain for 10<sup>10</sup> years, then it will often be the case during this period that the 100,000 objects are all consumed by fire at once on a single day, and even that not a single object suffers damage over the course of an entire year. Nevertheless, every insurance company places its faith in the calculus of probabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n287/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>in justification of the idea</a> that we live in a highly improbable “low-entropy” part of the universe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I refuse to grant the objection that a mental picture requiring so great a number of dead parts of the universe for the explanation of so small a number of animated parts is wasteful, and hence inexpedient. I still vividly remember someone who adamantly refused to believe that the Sun’s distance from the Earth is 20 million miles on the ground that it would simply be foolish to assume so vast a space only containing luminiferous aether alongside so small a space filled with life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Curiously—given his apparent reliance on “commonsense” arguments—Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n285/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>also says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I myself have repeatedly cautioned against placing excessive trust in the extension of our mental pictures beyond experience and issued reminders that the pictures of contemporary mechanics, and in particular the conception of the smallest particles of bodies as material points, will turn out to be provisional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, we don’t know that we can think of atoms (even if they exist at all) as points, and we can’t really expect our everyday intuition to tell us about how they work. Which presumably means that we need some kind of solid, “formal” argument if we’re going to explain the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Zermelo didn’t respond again, and moved on to other topics. But Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n291/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote one more paper</a> in 1897 about “A Mechanical Theorem of Poincaré” ending with two more why-it-doesn’t-apply-in-practice arguments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Poincaré’s theorem is of course never applicable to terrestrial bodies which we can hold in our hands as none of them is entirely closed. Nor it is applicable to an entirely closed gas of the sort considered by the kinetic theory if first the number of molecules and only then the quotients of the intervals between two neighboring collisions in the observation time is allowed to become infinite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--Section 11 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>Ensembles, and an Effort to Make Things Rigorous</h2>\n<p>Boltzmann—and Maxwell before him—had introduced the idea of using probability theory to discuss the emergence of thermodynamics and potentially the Second Law. But it wasn’t until around 1900—with the work of <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gibbs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>J. Willard Gibbs</a> (1839–1903)—that a principled mathematical framework for thinking about this developed. And while <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#why-the-second-law-works'>we can now see</a> that this framework distracts in some ways from several of the key issues in understanding the foundations of the Second Law, it’s been important in framing the discussion of what the Second Law really says—as well as being central in defining the foundations for much of what’s been done over the past century or so under the banner of “statistical mechanics”. </p>\n<p>Gibbs seems to have first gotten involved with thermodynamics around 1870. He’d finished his PhD at Yale on <a href='https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/16662400' target=_blank rel=noopener>the geometry of gears</a> in 1863—getting the first engineering PhD awarded in the US. After traveling in Europe and interacting with various leading mathematicians and physicists, he came back to Yale (where he stayed for the remaining 34 years of his life) and in 1871 became professor of mathematical physics there. </p>\n<p>His first papers (published in 1873 when he was already 34 years old) were in a sense based on taking seriously the formalism of equilibrium thermodynamics defined by Clausius and Maxwell—treating entropy and internal energy, just like pressure, volume and temperature, as variables that defined properties of materials (and notably whether they were solids, liquids or gases). Gibbs’s main idea was to “geometrize” this setup, and make it essentially a story of multivariate calculus:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img171.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactions02conn/page/n359/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img171.png\" width='620' height='515' /></a></p>\n<p>Unlike the European developers of thermodynamics, Gibbs didn’t interact deeply with other scientists—with the possible exception of Maxwell, who (a few years before his death in 1879) made a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_thermodynamic_surface' target=_blank rel=noopener>3D version of Gibbs&#8217;s thermodynamic surface out of clay</a>—and supplemented his 2D thermodynamic diagrams <a href='https://archive.org/details/theoryheat03maxwgoog/page/n5/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>after the first edition of his textbook <em>Theory of Heat</em></a> with renderings of 3D versions:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img172.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/theoryheat03maxwgoog/page/n5/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img172.png\" width='507' height='399' /></a></p>\n<p>Three years later, Gibbs began publishing what would be a 300-page work defining what has become the standard formalism for equilibrium chemical thermodynamics. He began with a quote from Clausius:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory11922img55.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactions03conn/page/108/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory11922img55.png\" width='594' height='399' /></a></p>\n<p>In the years that followed, <a href='https://www.eng.uc.edu/~beaucag/Classes/AdvancedMaterialsThermodynamics/Books/Gibbs%20G.W.%20-%20Collected%20works.%20Thermodynamics.%20Volume%201-Longmans%20(1928).pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Gibbs’s work</a>—stimulated by Maxwell—mostly concentrated on electrodynamics, and later quaternions and vector analysis. But Gibbs published a few more small papers on thermodynamics—always in effect taking equilibrium (and the Second Law) for granted. </p>\n<p>In 1882—a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Turner_Eddy' target=_blank rel=noopener>Henry Eddy</a> (1844–1921) (who in 1879 had written a <a href='https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnyjps&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=10' target=_blank rel=noopener>book on thermodynamics</a>, and in 1890 would become president of the University of Cincinnati), claimed that “radiant heat” could be used to violate the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img174.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofamep20amer/page/334/mode/2\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img174.png\" width='620' height='310' /></a></p>\n<p>Gibbs soon published a 2-page rebuttal (in the <a href='https://www.science.org/toc/science/ns-1/6' target=_blank rel=noopener>6th-ever issue of <em>Science</em> magazine</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img175.png\" data-url=\" https://archive.org/details/scientificpaper00gibbgoog/page/n439/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img175.png\" width='300' height='214' /></a></p>\n<p>Then in 1889 Clausius died, and Gibbs wrote an obituary—praising Clausius but making it clear he didn’t think the kinetic theory of gases was a solved problem:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img176.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof02gibb/page/n17/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img176.png\" alt='' title='' width='600' height='146' /></a></p>\n<p>That same year Gibbs announced a short course that he would teach at Yale on “The <em>a priori</em> Deduction of Thermodynamic Principles from the Theory of Probabilities”. After a decade of work, this evolved into Gibbs’s last publication—an original and elegant book that’s largely defined how the Second Law has been thought about ever since:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific

begins by explaining that mechanics is about studying the time evolution of single systems:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img178.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n12/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

is going to do something different: he is going to look at what he’ll call an ensemble of systems, and see how the distribution of their characteristics changes over time:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img179.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n12/mode/2up\"><img

explains that these “inquiries” originally arose in connection with deriving the laws of thermodynamics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img180.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

this area—which he’s calling statistical mechanics—is worth investigating even independent of its connection to thermodynamics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img181.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

this effort will be relevant to the foundations of thermodynamics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img182.png\"

src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img182.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"89\" /></a></p>\n<p>He immediately then goes on to what he’ll claim is the way to think about the relation of “observed thermodynamics” to his exact statistical mechanics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img183.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

interesting—if, in the light of history, very overly optimistic—claim that “the laws of thermodynamics may be easily obtained from the principles of statistical mechanics”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img184.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img

first the text of the book reads very much like a typical mathematical work on mechanics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img185.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n26/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

“going statistical”, talking about the “density” of systems in “phase” (i.e. with respect to the variables defining the configuration of the system). And a few pages in, he’s proving the fundamental result that the density of “phase fluid” satisfies a continuity equation (which we’d now call the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Liouville equation</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img186.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n34/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img186.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s all quite elegant, and all very rooted in the calculus-based mathematics of its time. He’s thinking about a collection of instances of a system. But while with our modern computational paradigm we’d readily be able to talk about a discrete list of instances, with his calculus-based approach he has to consider a continuous collection of instances—whose treatment inevitably seems more abstract and less explicit.</p>\n<p>He soon makes contact with the “theory of errors”, discussing in effect how probability distributions over the space of possible states evolve. But what probability distributions should one consider? By chapter 4, he’s looking at what he calls (and is still called) the “canonical distribution”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img187.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img187.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He gives a now-classic definition for the probability as a function of energy ϵ:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img188.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img188.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He observes that this distribution combines nicely when independent parts of a system are brought together, and soon he’s noting that:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img189.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img189.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But so far he’s careful to just talk about how things are “analogous”, without committing to a true connection:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img190.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n70/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img190.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>More than halfway through the book he’s defined certain properties of his probability distributions that “may &#8230; correspond to the thermodynamic notions of entropy and temperature”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img191.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n130/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img191.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"211\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next he’s on to the concept of a “microcanonical ensemble” that includes only states of a given energy. For him—with his continuum-based setup—this is a slightly elaborate thing to define; in our modern computational framework it actually becomes more straightforward than his &#8220;canonical ensemble&#8221;. Or, as he already says:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img192.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n142/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img192.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But what about the Second Law? Now he’s getting a little closer:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img193.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n156/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img193.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"94\" /></a></p>\n<p>When he says “index of probability” he’s talking about the log of a probability in his ensemble, so this result is about the fact that this quantity is extremized when all the elements of the ensemble have equal probability:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img194.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n156/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img194.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Soon he’s discussing whether he can use his index as a way—like Boltzmann tried to do with his version of entropy—to measure deviations from “statistical equilibrium”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img195.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n172/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img195.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But now Gibbs has hit one of the classic gotchas of his approach: if you look in perfect detail at the evolution of an ensemble of systems, there’ll never be a change in the value of his index—essentially because of the overall conservation of probability. Gibbs brings in what amounts to a commonsense physics argument to handle this. He says to consider putting “coloring matter” in a liquid that one stirs. And then he says that even though the liquid (like his phase fluid) is microscopically conserved, the coloring matter will still end up being “uniformly mixed” in the liquid:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img196.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n172/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img196.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He talks about how the conclusion about whether mixing happens in effect depends on what order one takes limits in. And while he doesn’t put it quite this way, he’s essentially realized that there’s a competition between the system “mixing things up more and more finely” and the observer being able to track finer and finer details. He realizes, though, that not all systems will show this kind of mixing behavior, noting for example that there are mechanical systems that’ll just keep going in simple cycles forever. </p>\n<p>He doesn’t really resolve the question of why “practical systems” should show mixing, more or less ending with a statement that even though his underlying mechanical systems are reversible, it’s somehow “in practice” difficult to go back:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img197.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n178/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img197.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite things like this, Gibbs appears to have been keen to keep the majority of his book “purely mathematical”, in effect proving theorems that necessarily followed from the setup he had given. But in the penultimate chapter of the book he makes what he seems to have viewed as a less-than-satisfactory attempt to connect what he’s done with “real thermodynamics”. He doesn’t really commit to the connection, though, characterizing it more as an “analogy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img198.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n192/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img198.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But he soon starts to be pretty clear that he actually wants to prove the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img199.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n194/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img199.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He quickly backs off a little, in effect bringing in the observer to soften the requirements:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img200.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n194/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img200.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But then he fires his best shot. He says that the quantities he’s defined in connection with his canonical ensemble satisfy the same equations as Clausius originally set up for temperature and entropy:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img201.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n196/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img201.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He adds that fluctuations (or “anomalies”, as he calls them) become imperceptible in the limit of a large system:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img202.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n196/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img202.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But in physical reality, why should one have a whole collection of systems as in the canonical ensemble? Gibbs suggests it would be more natural to look at the microcanonical ensemble—and in fact to look at a “time ensemble”, i.e. an averaging over time rather than an averaging over different possible states of the system:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img203.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n196/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img203.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gibbs has proved some results (e.g. related to the virial theorem) about the relation between time and ensemble averages. But as the future of the subject amply demonstrates, they’re not nearly strong enough to establish any general equivalence. Still, Gibbs presses on.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, as he himself recognized, things weren’t solved—and certainly the canonical ensemble wasn’t the whole story:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img204.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n206/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img204.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He discusses the tradeoff between having a canonical ensemble “heat bath” of a known temperature, and having a microcanonical ensemble with known energy. At one point he admits that it might be better to consider the time evolution of a single state, but basically decides that—at least in his continuous-probability-distribution-based formalism—he can’t really set this up:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img205.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n208/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img205.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gibbs definitely encourages the idea that his “statistical mechanics” has successfully “derived” thermodynamics. But he’s ultimately quite careful and circumspect in what he actually says. He mentions the Second Law only once in his whole book—and then only to note that he can get the same “mathematical expression” from his canonical ensemble as Clausius’s form of the Second Law. He doesn’t mention Boltzmann’s <em>H</em> theorem anywhere in the book, and—apart from one footnote concerning “difficulties long recognized by physicists”—he mentions only Boltzmann’s work on theoretical mechanics.</p>\n<p>One can view the main achievement of Gibbs’s book as having been to define a framework in which precise results about the statistical properties of collections of systems could be defined and in some cases derived. Within the mathematics and other formalism of the time, such ensemble results represented in a sense a distinctly “higher-order” description of things. Within our current computational paradigm, though, there’s much less of a distinction to be made: whether one’s looking at a single path of evolution, or a whole collection, one’s ultimately still just dealing with a computation. And that makes it clearer that—ensembles or not—one’s thrown back into the same kinds of issues about the origin of the Second Law. But even so, Gibbs provided a language in which to talk with some clarity about many of the things that come up.</p>\n<p><!--Section 12 Maxwell's Demon--></p>\n<h2 id='maxwell&rsquo;s-demon'>Maxwell&#8217;s Demon</h2>\n<p>In late 1867 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tait/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Peter Tait</a> (1831–1901)—a childhood friend of Maxwell’s who was by then a professor of “natural philosophy” in Edinburgh—was finishing his sixth book. It was entitled <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/sketchofthermody00taitrich/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sketch of Thermodynamics</a></em> and gave a brief, historically oriented and not particularly conceptual outline of what was then known about thermodynamics. He sent a draft to Maxwell, who responded with a fairly long letter:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img206.png\" data-url=\"https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PH-CAVENDISH-P-00092/1\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img206.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/212/mode/2up?view=theater' target=_blank rel=noopener>The letter</a> begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I do not know in a controversial manner the history of thermodynamics &#8230; [and] I could make no assertions about the priority of authors &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Any contributions I could make &#8230; [involve] picking holes here and there to ensure strength and stability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/212/mode/\\2up?view=theater\" target=_blank rel=noopener>he continues</a> (with “ΘΔcs” being his whimsical Greekified rendering of the word “thermodynamics”):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">To pick a hole—say in the 2nd law of ΘΔcs, that if two things are in contact the hotter cannot take heat from the colder without external agency.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Now let A and B be two vessels divided by a diaphragm &#8230; Now conceive a finite being who knows the paths and velocities of all the molecules by simple inspection but who can do no work except open and close a hole in the diaphragm by means of a slide without mass.

Tait must at some point have shown Maxwell’s letter to Kelvin, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/214/mode/\\2up?view=theater\" target=_blank rel=noopener>who wrote on it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Very good.

But Maxwell included one final chapter:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img208.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=10\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img208.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Even in 1871, after all his <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases' target=_blank rel=noopener>work on kinetic theory</a>, Maxwell is quite circumspect in his discussion of molecules:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img209.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=298\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img209.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But Maxwell’s textbook goes through a series of standard kinetic theory results, much as a modern textbook would. The second-to-last section in the whole book sounds a warning, however:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img210.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=321\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img210.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Interestingly, Maxwell continues, somewhat in anticipation of what Gibbs will say 30 years later:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img211.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=322\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img211.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But then there’s a reminder that this is being written in 1871, several decades before any clear observation of molecules was made. Maxwell says:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img212.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=322\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img212.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In other words, if there are water molecules, there must be something other than a law of averages that makes them all appear the same. And, yes, it’s now treated as a fundamental fact of physics that, for example, all electrons have exactly—not just statistically—the same properties such as mass and charge. But back in 1871 it was much less clear what characteristics molecules—if they existed as real entities at all—might have.</p>\n<p>Maxwell included one last section in his book that to us today might seem quite wild:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img213.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=323\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img213.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In other words, aware of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin' target=_blank rel=noopener>Darwin</a>’s (1809–1882) 1859 <em>Origin of Species</em>, he’s considering a kind of “speciation” of molecules, along the lines of the discrete species observed in biology. But then he notes that unlike biological organisms, molecules are “permanent”, so their “selection” must come from some kind of pure separation process:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img214.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=324\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img214.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And at the very end he suggests that if molecules really are all identical, that suggests a level of fundamental order in the world that we might even be able to flow through to “exact principles of distributive justice” (presumably for people rather than molecules):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img215.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=325\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img215.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Maxwell has described rather clearly his idea of demons. But the actual name “demon” first appears in print in a paper by Kelvin in 1874:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img216.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_nature-uk_1874-04-09_9_232/page/440/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img216.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>It’s a British paper, so—in a nod to future nanomachinery—it’s talking about (molecular) cricket bats:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img217.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_nature-uk_1874-04-09_9_232/page/442/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img217.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kelvin’s paper—like his note written on Maxwell’s letter—imagines that the demons don’t just “sort” molecules; they actually reverse their velocities, thus in effect anticipating Loschmidt’s 1876 “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#but-what-about-reversibility?' target=_blank rel=noopener>reversibility objection</a>” to Boltzmann’s <em>H</em> theorem.</p>\n<p>In an undated note, Maxwell <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/214/mode/\\2up?view=theater\" target=_blank rel=noopener>discusses demons</a>, attributing the name to Kelvin—and then starts considering the “physicalization” of demons, simplifying what they need to do: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Concerning Demons.<br />\nI. Who gave them this name? Thomson.<br />\n2. What were they by nature?

To show that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics has only a statistical certainty.<br />\n4. Is the production of an inequality of temperature their only occupation? No, for less intelligent demons can produce a difference in pressure as well as temperature by merely allowing all particles going in one direction while stopping all those going the other way. This reduces the demon to a valve. As such value him. Call him no more a demon but a valve like that of the hydraulic ram, suppose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It didn’t take long for Maxwell’s demon to become something of a fixture in expositions of thermodynamics, even if it wasn’t clear how it connected to other things people were saying about thermodynamics. And in 1879, for example, Kelvin gave a talk all about Maxwell’s “sorting demon” (like other British people of the time he referred to Maxwell as “Clerk Maxwell”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img218.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mathematicalphys05kelvuoft/page/20/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img218.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Kelvin describes—without much commentary, and without mentioning the Second Law—some of the feats of which the demon would be capable.

One might think that the observability of Brownian motion would make something like a Maxwell’s demon possible. And indeed in 1912 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Smoluchowski/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Marian Smoluchowski</a> (1872–1917) suggested <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_ratchet' target=_blank rel=noopener>experiments that one could imagine</a> would “systematically harvest” Brownian motion—but showed that in fact they couldn’t. In later years, a sequence of arguments were advanced that the mechanism of a Maxwell’s demon just couldn’t work in practice—though even today microscopic versions of what amount to Maxwell’s demons are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#maxwell&rsquo;s-demon' target=_blank rel=noopener>routinely being investigated</a>.</p>\n<p><!--Timeline section--></p>\n<h2 id='what-happened-to-those-people?'>What Happened to Those People?</h2>\n<p>We’ve finally now come to the end of the story of how the original framework for the Second Law came to be set up.

Clausius, Boltzmann and Gibbs are today celebrated mainly for their contributions to thermodynamics; Kelvin and Maxwell also for other things. Clausius and Gibbs were in a sense “pure professors”; Boltzmann, Maxwell and especially Kelvin also had engagement with the more general public.</p>\n<p>All of them spent the majority of their lives in the countries of their birth—and all (with the exception of Carnot) were able to live out the entirety of their lives without time-consuming disruptions from war or other upheavals:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img222_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img222.png\" alt='' title='' width='541' height=''> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<h3>Sadi Carnot (1796&ndash;1832)</h3>\n<p>Almost all of what is known about Sadi Carnot as a person comes from a single biographical note written nearly half a century after his death by his younger brother <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Carnot' target=_blank rel=noopener>Hippolyte Carnot</a> (who was a distinguished French politician—and sometime education minister—and father of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadi_Carnot_(statesman)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sadi Carnot</a> who would become president of France). Hippolyte Carnot <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f86.image\" target=_blank rel=noopener>began by saying that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nAs the life of Sadi Carnot was not marked by any notable event, his biography would have occupied only a few lines; but a scientific work by him, after remaining long in obscurity, brought again to light many years after his death, has caused his name to be placed among those of great inventors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Carnots’ father was close to Napoleon, and Hippolyte explains that when Sadi was a young child he ended up being babysat by “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Jos%C3%A9phine' target=_blank rel=noopener>Madame Bonaparte</a>”—but one day wandered off, and was found inspecting the operation of a nearby mill, and quizzing the miller about it. For the most part, however, throughout his life, Sadi Carnot apparently kept very much to himself—while with quiet intensity showing a great appetite for intellectual pursuits from mathematics and science to art, music and literature, as well as practical engineering and the science of various sports.</p>\n<p>Even his brother Hippolyte can’t explain quite how Sadi Carnot—at the age of 28—suddenly “came out” and in 1824 published his book on thermodynamics. (As we discussed above, it no doubt had something to do with the work of <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Carnot/' target=_blank rel=noopener>his father</a>, who died two years earlier.) Sadi Carnot funded the publication of the book himself—having 600 copies printed (at least some of which remained unsold a decade later). But after the book was published, Carnot appears to have returned to just privately doing research, living alone, and never publishing again in his lifetime. And indeed he lived only another eight years, dying (apparently after some months of ill health) in the same Paris cholera outbreak that claimed <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Maximilien_Lamarque' target=_blank rel=noopener>General Lamarque</a> of <em>Les Misérables</em> fame.</p>\n<p>Twenty-three pages of <a href='https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f96' target=_blank rel=noopener>unpublished personal notes</a> survive from the period after the publication of Carnot’s book. Some are general aphorisms and life principles: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Speak little of what you know, and not at all of what you do not know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Why try to be witty? I would rather be thought stupid and modest than witty and pretentious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">God cannot punish man for not believing when he could so easily have enlightened and convinced him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The belief in an all-powerful Being, who loves us and watches over us, gives to the mind great strength to endure misfortune.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">When walking, carry a book, a notebook to preserve ideas, and a piece of bread in order to prolong the walk if need be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But others are more technical—and in fact reveal that Carnot, despite having based his book on caloric theory, had <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f107\" target=_blank rel=noopener>realized that it probably wasn’t correct</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">When a hypothesis no longer suffices to explain phenomena, it should be abandoned. This is the case with the hypothesis which regards caloric as matter, as a subtile fluid.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The experimental facts tending to destroy this theory are as follows: The development of heat by percussion or friction of bodies &#8230; The elevation of temperature which takes place [when] air [expands into a] vacuum &#8230; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f109\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nAt present, light is generally regarded as the result of a vibratory movement of the ethereal fluid. Light produces heat, or at least accompanies radiating heat, and moves with the same velocity as heat. Radiating heat is then a vibratory movement. It would be ridiculous to suppose that it is an emission of matter while the light which accompanies it could be only a movement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nCould a motion (that of radiating heat) produce matter (caloric)? No, undoubtedly; it can only produce a motion. Heat is then the result of a motion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then—in a rather clear enunciation of <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f111\" target=_blank rel=noopener>what would become</a> the First Law of thermodynamics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nHeat is simply motive power, or rather motion which has changed form. It is a movement among the particles of bodies. Wherever there is destruction of motive power there is, at the same time, production of heat in quantity exactly proportional to the quantity of motive power destroyed. Reciprocally, wherever there is destruction of heat, there is production of motive power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carnot <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f110\" target=_blank rel=noopener>also wonders</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nLiquefaction of bodies, solidification of liquids, crystallization—are they not forms of combinations of integrant molecules? Supposing heat due to a vibratory movement, how can the passage from the solid or the liquid to the gaseous state be explained?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no indication of how Carnot felt about this emerging rethinking of thermodynamics, or of how it might affect the results in his book. But Carnot clearly hoped to do experiments (as outlined in his notes) to test what was really going on. But as it was, he presumably didn’t get around to any of them—and his notes, ahead of their time as they were, did not resurface for many decades, by which time the ideas they contained had already been discovered by others.</p>\n<h3>Rudolf Clausius (1822&ndash;1888)</h3>\n<p>Rudolf Clausius was born in what’s now Poland (and was then Prussia), one of more than 14 children of an education administrator and pastor. He went to university in Berlin, and, after considering doing history, eventually specialized in math and physics. After graduating in 1844 he started teaching at a top high school in Berlin (which he did for 6 years), and meanwhile earned his PhD in physics. His career took off after his breakout paper on thermodynamics appeared in 1850. For a while he was a professor in Berlin, then for 12 years in Zürich, then briefly in Würzburg, then—for the remaining 19 years of his life—in Bonn.</p>\n<p>He was a diligent—if, one suspects, somewhat stiff—professor, notable for the clarity of his lectures, and his organizational care with students. He seems to have been a competent administrator, and late in his career he spent a couple of years as the president (“rector”) of his university. But first and foremost, he was a researcher, writing about a hundred papers over the course of his career. Most physicists of the time devoted at least some of their efforts to doing actual physics experiments. But Clausius was a pioneer in the idea of being a “pure theoretical physicist”, inspired by experiments and quoting their results, but not doing them himself. </p>\n<p>The majority of Clausius’s papers were about thermodynamics, though late in his career his emphasis shifted more to electrodynamics. Clausius’s papers were original, clear, incisive and often fairly mathematically sophisticated. But from his very first paper on thermodynamics in 1850, he very much adopted a macroscopic approach, talking about what he considered to be “bulk” quantities like energy, and later entropy. He did explore some of the potential mechanics of molecules, but he never really made the connection between molecular phenomena and entropy—or the Second Law. He had a number of run-ins about academic credit with Kelvin, Tait, Maxwell and Boltzmann, but he didn’t seem to ever pay much attention to, for example, Boltzmann’s efforts to find molecular-based probabilistic derivations of Clausius’s results.</p>\n<p>It probably didn’t help that after two decades of highly productive work, two misfortunes befell Clausius. First, in 1870, he had volunteered to lead an ambulance corps in the Franco-Prussian war, and was wounded in the knee, leading to chronic pain (as well as to his habit of riding to class on horseback). And then, in 1875, Clausius’s wife died in the birth of their sixth child—leaving him to care for six young children (which apparently he did with great conscientiousness). Clausius nevertheless continued to pursue his research—even to the end of his life—receiving many honors along the way (like election to no less than 40 professional societies), but it never again rose to the level of significance of his early work on thermodynamics and the Second Law.</p>\n<h3>Kelvin (William Thomson) (1824&ndash;1907)</h3>\n<p>Of the people we’re discussing here, by far the most famous during their lifetime was Kelvin. In his long career he wrote more than 600 scientific papers, received dozens of patents, started several companies and served in many administrative and governmental roles. His father was a math professor, ultimately in Glasgow, who took a great interest in the education of his children. Kelvin himself got an early start, effectively going to college at the age of 10, and becoming a professor in Glasgow at the age of 22—a position in which he continued for 53 years.</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s breakout work, done in his twenties, was on thermodynamics. But over the years he also worked on many other areas of physics, and beyond, mixing theory, experiment and engineering. Beginning in 1854 he became involved in a technical megaproject of the time: the attempt to lay a transatlantic telegraph cable. He wound up very much on the front lines, helping out as a just-in-time physicist + engineer on the cable-laying ship. The first few attempts didn’t work out, but finally in 1866—in no small part through Kelvin’s contributions—a cable was successfully laid, and Kelvin (or William Thomson, as he then was) became something of a celebrity. He was made “Sir William Thomson” and—along with two other techies—formed his first company, which had considerable success in exploiting telegraph-cable-related engineering innovations.</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s first wife died after a long illness in 1870, and Kelvin, with no children and already enthusiastic about the sea, bought a fairly large yacht, and pursued a number of nautical-related projects. One of these—begun in 1872—was the construction of an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide-predicting_machine' target=_blank rel=noopener>analog computer for calculating tides</a> (basically with 10 gears for adding up 10 harmonic tide components), a device that, with progressive refinements, continued to be used for close to a century. </p>\n<p>Being rather charmed by Kelvin’s physicist-with-a-big-yacht persona, I once purchased a letter that Kelvin wrote in 1877 on the letterhead of “Yacht Lalla Rookh”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img223.png\"><img loading='lazy'\n src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img223.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='300' height=''></a></p>\n<p>The letter—in true academic style—promises that Kelvin will soon send an article he’s been asked to write on elasticity theory. And in fact he did write the article, and it was an <a href='https://archive.org/details/encyclopaedia-britannica-9ed-1875/Vol%207%20%28DEA-ELD%29%20193916234.23/page/796/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>expository one</a> that appeared in the <a href='https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.209714' target=_blank rel=noopener>9th edition of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Kelvin was a prolific (if, to modern ears, sometimes rather pompous) writer, who took exposition seriously. And indeed—finding the textbooks available to him as a professor inadequate—he worked over the course of a dozen years (1855–1867) with his (and Maxwell&#8217;s) friend Peter Guthrie Tait to produce the influential <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/treatisnatphil01kelvrich/page/n7/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Treatise on Natural Philosophy</a></em>. </p>\n<p>Kelvin explored many topics and theories, some more immediately successful than others. In the 1870s he suggested that perhaps <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-14--history-of-elementary-particles/'>atoms might be knotted vortices</a> in the (luminiferous) aether (causing Tait to begin developing knot theory)—a hypothesis that&#8217;s in some sense a Victorian prelude to modern ideas about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>particles in our Physics Project</a>.</p>\n<p>Throughout his life, Kelvin was a devout Christian, writing that &#8220;The more thoroughly I conduct scientific research, the more I believe science excludes atheism.” And indeed this belief seems to make an appearance in his implication that humans—presumably as a result of their special relationship with God—might avoid the Second Law. But more significant at the time was Kelvin&#8217;s skepticism about Charles Darwin&#8217;s 1859 theory of natural selection, believing that there must in the end be a &#8220;continually guiding and controlling intelligence&#8221;. Despite being somewhat ridiculed for it, Kelvin talked about the possibility that <a href='https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/608/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>life might have come to Earth from elsewhere via meteorites</a>, believing that his estimates of the age of the Earth (which didn&#8217;t take into account radioactivity) made it too young for the things Darwin described to have occurred.</p>\n<p>By the 1870s, Kelvin had become a distinguished man of science, receiving all sorts of honors, assignments and invitations. And in 1876, for example, he was invited to Philadelphia to chair the committee judging electrical inventions at the US Centennial International Exhibition, notably reporting, in the terms of the time:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img224.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/670/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img224.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='460' height=''></a></p>\n<p>Then in 1892 a <a href='https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/904/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>&#8220;peerage of the realm&#8221; was conferred</a> on him by Queen Victoria. His wife (he had remarried) and various friends (including Charles Darwin’s son George) suggested he pick the title “Kelvin”, after the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Kelvin' target=_blank rel=noopener>River Kelvin</a> that flowed by the university in Glasgow. And by the end of his life “Lord Kelvin” had accumulated enough honorifics that they were just summarized with “&#8230;” (the MD was an honorary degree conferred by the University of Heidelberg because “<a href='https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/1108/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>it was the only one at their disposal which he did not already possess</a>”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img225.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mathematicalphys06kelvuoft/page/n9/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img225.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='555' height='143'> </a></p>\n<p>And when Kelvin died in 1907 he was given a state funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey near Newton and Darwin.</p>\n<h3>James Clerk Maxwell (1831&ndash;1879)</h3>\n<p>James Clerk Maxwell lived only 48 years but in that time managed to do a remarkable amount of important science. His early years were spent on a 1500-acre family estate (inherited by his father) in a fairly remote part of Scotland—to which he would return later. He was an only child and was homeschooled—initially by his mother, until she died, when he was 8. At 10 he went to an upscale school in Edinburgh, and by the age of 14 had written his <a href='https://archive.org/details/scientificpapers01maxw/page/n37/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>first scientific paper</a>. At 16 he went as an undergraduate to the University of Edinburgh, then, effectively as a graduate student, to Cambridge—coming second in the final exams (“Second Wrangler”) to a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Routh' target=_blank rel=noopener>Edward Routh</a>, who would spend most of his life coaching other students on those very same exams.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of years, Maxwell was a professor, first in Aberdeen, then in London. In Aberdeen he married the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Clerk_Maxwell' target=_blank rel=noopener>daughter of the university president</a>, who would soon be his <a href='https://archive.org/details/scientificpapers01maxw/page/426/' target=_blank rel=noopener>&#8220;Observer K&#8221;</a> (for “Katherine”) in his classic work on color vision. But after nine fairly strenuous years as a professor, Maxwell in 1865 “retired” to his family estate, supervising a house renovation, and in “rural solitude” (recreationally riding around his estate on horseback with his wife) having the most scientifically productive time of his life. In addition to his work on things like the kinetic theory of gases, he also wrote his 2-volume <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/electricandmagne01maxwrich/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</a></em>, which ultimately took 7 years to finish, and which, with considerable clarity, described his approach to electromagnetism and what are now called “Maxwell’s Equations”. Occasionally, there were hints of his “country life”—like his 1870 “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/232' target=_blank rel=noopener>On Hills and Dales</a>” that in his characteristic mathematicize-everything way gave a kind of “pre-topological” analysis of contour maps (perhaps conceived as he walked half a mile every day down to the mailbox at which journals and correspondence would arrive):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img226.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/240/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img226.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='253' height='350'> </a></p>\n<p>As a person, Maxwell was calm, reserved and unassuming, yet cheerful and charming—and given to <a href='https://archive.org/details/lifeofjamesclerk00camprich/page/576' target=_blank rel=noopener>writing (arguably sometimes sophomoric) poetry</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img227.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/lifeofjamesclerk00camprich/page/279/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img227.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='390'> </a></p>\n<p>With a certain sense of the absurd, he would occasionally publish satirical pieces in <em>Nature</em>, signing them <em>dp</em>/<em>dt</em>, which in the thermodynamic notation created by his friend Tait was equal to JCM, which were his initials. Maxwell liked games and tricks, and spinning tops featured prominently in some of his work. He enjoyed children, though never had any of his own. As a lecturer, he prepared diligently, but often got too sophisticated for his audience. In writing, though, he showed both great clarity and great erudition, for example freely quoting Latin and Greek in articles he wrote for the 9th edition of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (of which he was scientific co-editor) on topics such as “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/445/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Atom</a>” and “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/763/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ether</a>”. </p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, Maxwell was quite an enthusiast of diagrams and visual presentation (even writing an article on “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/647/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Diagrams</a>” for the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>). He was also a capable experimentalist, making many measurements (sometimes along with his wife), and in 1861 creating the first color photograph.</p>\n<p>In 1871 William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, who had studied math in Cambridge, and was now chancellor of the university, agreed to put up the money to build what became the Cavendish Laboratory and to endow a new chair of experimental physics. Kelvin having turned down the job, it was offered to the still-rather-obscure Maxwell, who somewhat reluctantly accepted—with the result that for several years he spent much of his time supervising the design and building of the lab. </p>\n<p>The lab was finished in 1874, but then William Cavendish dropped on Maxwell a large collection of papers from his great uncle Henry Cavendish, who had been a wealthy “gentleman scientist” of the late 1700s and (among other things) the discoverer of hydrogen. Maxwell liked history (as some of us do!), noticed that Cavendish had discovered Ohm’s law 50 years before Ohm, and in the end spent several years painstakingly editing and annotating the papers into a <a href='https://archive.org/details/electricalresear00caveuoft/' target=_blank rel=noopener>500-page book</a>. By 1879 Maxwell was finally ready to energetically concentrate on physics research again, but, sadly, in the fall of that year his health failed, and he died at the age of 48—having succumbed to stomach cancer, as his mother also had at almost the same age.</p>\n<h3>J. Willard Gibbs (1839&ndash;1903)</h3>\n<p>Gibbs was born near the Yale campus, and died there 64 years later, in the same house where he had lived since he was 7 years old (save for three years spent visiting European universities as a young man, and regular summer “out-in-nature” vacations). <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs_Sr.' target=_blank rel=noopener>His father</a> (who, like, “our Gibbs” was named “Josiah Willard”—making “our Gibbs” be called “Willard”) came from an old and distinguished intellectual and religious New England family, and was a professor of sacred languages at Yale. Willard Gibbs went to college and graduate school at Yale, and then spent his whole career as a professor at Yale. </p>\n<p>He was, it seems, a quiet, modest and rather distant person, who radiated a certain serenity, regularly attended church, had a small circle of friends and lived with his two sisters (and the husband and children of one of them). He diligently discharged his teaching responsibilities, though his lectures were very sparsely attended, and he seems not to have been thought forceful enough in dealing with people to have been called on for many administrative tasks—though he became the treasurer of his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_School' target=_blank rel=noopener>former high school</a>, and himself was careful enough with money that by the end of his life he had accumulated what would <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%24100k+1903+dollars'>now be several million dollars</a>.</p>\n<p>He had begun his academic career in practical engineering, for example <a href='https://patents.google.com/patent/US53971A' target=_blank rel=noopener>patenting an &#8220;improved [railway] car-brake&#8221;</a>, but was soon drawn in more mathematical directions, favoring a certain clarity and minimalism of formulation, and a cleanliness, if not brevity, of exposition. His work on thermodynamics (initially published in the rather obscure <em>Transactions of the Connecticut Academy</em>) was divided into two parts: the first, in the 1870s, concentrating on macroscopic equilibrium properties, and second, in the 1890s, concentrating on microscopic “statistical mechanics” (as Gibbs called it). Even before he started on thermodynamics, he’d been interested in electromagnetism, and between his two “thermodynamic periods”, he again worked on electromagnetism. He studied Maxwell’s work, and was at first drawn to the then-popular formalism of quaternions—but soon decided to invent his own approach and notation for vector analysis, which at first he presented only in notes for his students, though it later became widely adopted. </p>\n<p>And while Gibbs did increasingly mathematical work, he never seems to have identified as a mathematician, modestly stating that “If I have had any success in mathematical physics, it is, I think, because I have been able to dodge mathematical difficulties.” His last work was his book on statistical mechanics, which—with considerable effort and perhaps damage to his health—he finished in time for publication in connection with the Yale bicentennial in 1901 (an event which notably also brought a visit from Kelvin), only to die soon thereafter.</p>\n<p>Gibbs had a few graduate students at Yale, a notable one being <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lee de Forest</a>, inventor of the vacuum tube (triode) electronic amplifier, and radio entrepreneur. (de Forest’s 1899 PhD thesis was entitled “Reflection of Hertzian Waves from the Ends of Parallel Wires”.) Another student of Gibbs was <a href='https://ethw.org/Lynde_Wheeler' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lynde Wheeler</a>, who became a government radio scientist, and who wrote a biography of Gibbs, of which I have a copy bought years ago at a used bookstore—that I was now just about to put back on a shelf when I opened its front cover and found an inscription:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img228.png\"><img loading='lazy'\n src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img228.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='620' height='305'> </a></p>\n<p>And, yes, it’s a small world, and “To Willard” refers to Gibbs’s sister’s son (<a href='https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/creator/145649#/titles' target=_blank rel=noopener>Willard Gibbs Van Name</a>, who became a naturalist and wrote a <a href='https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015067216146&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=5' target=_blank rel=noopener>1929 book about national park deforestation</a>).</p>\n<h3>Ludwig Boltzmann (1844&ndash;1906)</h3>\n<p>Of the people we’re discussing, Boltzmann is the one whose career was most focused on the Second Law. Boltzmann grew up in Austria, where his father was a civil servant (who died when Boltzmann was 15) and his mother was something of an heiress. Boltzmann did his PhD at the University of Vienna, where his professor notably gave him a copy of some of Maxwell’s papers, together with an English grammar book. Boltzmann started publishing his own papers near the end of his PhD, and soon landed a position as a professor of mathematical physics in Graz. Four years later he moved to Vienna as a professor of mathematics, soon moving back to Graz as a professor of “general and experimental physics”—a position he would keep for 14 years. </p>\n<p>He’d married in 1876, and had 5 children, though a son died in 1889, leaving 3 daughters and another son. Boltzmann was apparently a clear and lively lecturer, as well as a spirited and eager debater. He seems, at least in his younger years, to have been a happy and gregarious person, with a strong taste for music—and some charming do-it-your-own-way tendencies. For example, wanting to provide fresh milk for his children, he decided to just buy a cow, which he then led from the market through the streets—though had to consult his colleague, the professor of zoology, to find out how to milk it. Boltzmann was a capable experimental physicist, as well as a creator of gadgets, and a technology enthusiast—promoting the idea of airplanes (an application for gas theory!) and noting their potential power as a means of transportation.</p>\n<p>Boltzmann had always had mood swings, but by the early 1890s he claimed they were getting worse. It didn’t help that he was worn down by administrative work, and had worsening asthma and increasing nearsightedness (that he’d thought might be a sign of going blind). He moved positions, but then came back to Vienna, where he embarked on writing what would become a 2-volume book on <em>Gas Theory—</em>in effect contextualizing his life’s work. The introduction to the first volume laments that “gas theory has gone out of fashion in Germany”. The introduction to the second volume, written in 1898 when Boltzmann was 54, then says that “attacks on the theory of gases have begun to increase”, and <a href='https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/page/n212/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\n&#8230; it would be a great tragedy for science if the theory of gases were temporarily thrown into oblivion because of a momentary hostile attitude toward it, as, for example, was the wave theory [of light] because of Newton’s authority.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nI am conscious of being only an individual struggling weakly against the stream of time. But it still remains in my power to contribute in such a way that, when the theory of gases is again revived, not too much will have to be rediscovered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But even as he was writing this, Boltzmann had pretty much already wound down his physics research, and had basically switched to exposition, and to philosophy. He moved jobs again, but in 1902 again came back to Vienna, but now also as a professor of philosophy. He gave an inaugural lecture, first quoting his predecessor <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Ernst+Mach'>Ernst Mach</a> (1838–1916) as saying “I do not believe that atoms exist”, then discussing the philosophical relations between reality, perception and models. Elsewhere he discussed things like his view of the different philosophical character of models associated with differential equations and with atomism—and he even wrote an article on the general topic of “Models” for <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (which curiously also talks about “in pure mathematics, especially geometry, models constructed of papier-mâché and plaster”). Sometimes Boltzmann’s philosophy could be quite polemical, like his attack on <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Arthur+Schopenhauer\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Schopenhauer</a>, that ends by saying that “men [should] be freed from the spiritual migraine that is called metaphysics”. </p>\n<p>Then, in 1904, Boltzmann addressed the Vienna Philosophical Society (a kind of predecessor of the Vienna Circle) on the subject of a &#8220;Reply to a Lecture on Happiness by Professor Ostwald”. <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Wilhelm+Ostwald'>Wilhelm Ostwald</a> (1853–1932) (a chemist and social reformer, who was a personal friend of Boltzmann’s, but intellectual adversary) had proposed the concept of “energy of will” to apply mathematical physics ideas to psychology. Boltzmann mocked this, describing its faux formalism as “dangerous for science”. Meanwhile, Boltzmann gives his own Darwinian theory for the origin of happiness, based essentially on the idea that unhappiness is needed as a way to make organisms improve their circumstances in the struggle for survival. </p>\n<p>Boltzmann himself was continuing to have problems that he attributed to then-popular but very vague &#8220;diagnosis&#8221; of &#8220;neurasthenia&#8221;, and had even briefly been in a psychiatric hospital. But he continued to do things like travel. He visited the US three times, in 1905 going to California (mainly Berkeley)—which led him to write a witty piece entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/populreschrifte00boltgoog/page/n438/mode/\\\n2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>A German Professor&#8217;s Trip to El Dorado</a>&#8221; that concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Yes, America will achieve great things. I believe in these people, even after seeing them at work in a setting where they’re not at their best: integrating and differentiating at a theoretical physics seminar&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 1905 Einstein published his Boltzmann-and-atomism-based results on Brownian motion and on photons. But it’s not clear Boltzmann ever knew about them. For Boltzmann was sinking further. Perhaps he’d overexerted himself in California, but by the spring of 1906 he said he was no longer able to teach. In the summer he went with his family to an Italian seaside resort in an attempt to rejuvenate. But a day before they were to return to Vienna he failed to join his family for a swim, and his youngest daughter found him hanged in his hotel room, dead at the age of 62.</p>\n<p><!--Section 13 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='coarse-graining-and-the-&ldquo;modern-formulation&rdquo;'>Coarse-Graining and the &ldquo;Modern Formulation&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>After Gibbs’s 1902 book introducing the idea of ensembles, most of the language used (at least <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics' target=_blank rel=noopener>until now</a>!) to discuss the Second Law was basically in place. But in 1912 one additional term—representing a concept already implicit in Gibbs’s work—was added: coarse-graining. Gibbs had discussed how the phase fluid representing possible states of a system could be elaborately mixed by the mechanical time evolution of the system. But realistic practical measurements could not be expected to probe all the details of the distribution of phase fluid; instead one could say that they would only sample “coarse-grained” aspects of it.</p>\n<p>The term “coarse-graining” first appeared in a survey article entitled “The Conceptual Foundations of the Statistical Approach in Mechanics”, written for the German-language <em>Encyclopaedia of the Mathematical Sciences</em> by Boltzmann’s former student <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Paul Ehrenfest</a>, and his wife <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Tatiana Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img229.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/52/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img229.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The article also introduced all sorts of now-standard notation, and in many ways can be read as a final summary of what was achieved in the original development around the foundations of thermodynamics and the Second Law. (And indeed the article was sufficiently “final” that when it was republished as a <a href='https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>book in 1959</a> it could still be presented as usefully summarizing the state of things.)</p>\n<p>Looking at the article now, though, it’s notable how much it recognized was not at all settled about the Second Law and its foundations. It places Boltzmann squarely at the center, stating in its preface:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img230.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/n9/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img230.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The section titles are already revealing:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img231.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/n15/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img231.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And soon they’re starting to talk about “loose ends”, and lots of them. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ergodicity-and-global-behavior'>Ergodicity</a> is something one can talk about, but there’s no known example (and with this definition it was later proved that there couldn’t be):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img232.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/22/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img232.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But, they point out, it’s something Boltzmann needed in order to justify his results:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img233.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/24/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img233.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Soon they’re talking about Boltzmann’s sloppiness in his discussion of the <em>H</em> curve:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img234.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/24/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img234.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then they’re on to talking about Gibbs, and the gaps in his reasoning:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img235.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/55/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img235.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In the end they conclude:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img236.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/67/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img236.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In other words, even though people now seem to be buying all these results, there are still plenty of issues with their foundations. And despite people’s implicit assumptions, we can in no way say that the Second Law has been “proved”.</p>\n<p><!--Section 14 Radiant Heat, the Second Law and Quantum Mechanics--></p>\n<h2 id='radiant-heat,-the-second-law-and-quantum-mechanics'>Radiant Heat, the Second Law and Quantum Mechanics</h2>\n<p>It was already realized in the 1600s that when objects get hot they emit “heat radiation”—which can be transferred to other bodies as “radiant heat”. And particularly following Maxwell’s work in the 1860s on electrodynamics it came to be accepted that radiant heat was associated with electromagnetic waves propagating in the “luminiferous aether”. But unlike the molecules from which it was increasingly assumed that one could think of matter as being made, these electromagnetic waves were always treated—particularly on the basis of their mathematical foundations in calculus—as fundamentally continuous. </p>\n<p>But how might this relate to the Second Law? Could it be, perhaps, that the Second Law should ultimately be attributed not to some property of the large-scale mechanics of discrete molecules, but rather to a feature of continuous radiant heat?</p>\n<p>The basic equations assumed for mechanics—originally due to Newton—are reversible. But what about the equations for electrodynamics? Maxwell’s equations are in and of themselves also reversible. But when one thinks about their solutions for actual electromagnetic radiation, there can be fundamental irreversibility. And the reason is that it’s natural to describe the emission of radiation (say from a hot body), but then to assume that, once emitted, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p455--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>the radiation just &#8220;escapes to infinity”</a>—rather than ever reversing the process of emission by being absorbed by some other body.</p>\n<p>All the various people we’ve discussed above, from Clausius to Gibbs, made occasional remarks about the possibility that the Second Law—whether or not it could be “derived mechanically”—would still ultimately work, if nothing else, because of the irreversible emission of radiant heat.</p>\n<p>But the person who would ultimately be most intimately connected to these issues was Max Planck—though in the end the somewhat-confused connection to the Second Law would recede in importance relative to what emerged from it, which was basically the raw material that led to quantum theory.</p>\n<p>As a student of Helmholtz&#8217;s in Berlin, Max Planck got interested in thermodynamics, and in 1879 wrote a 61-page PhD thesis entitled “On the Second Law of Mechanical Heat Theory”. It was a traditional (if slightly streamlined) discussion of the Second Law, very much based on Clausius’s approach (and even with the same title as <a href='https://archive.org/details/berdenzweitenha00claugoog/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Clausius&#8217;s 1867 paper</a>)—and without any mention whatsoever of Boltzmann:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img237.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOctQEACAAJ&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&#038;cad=0#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img237.png\" width='620' height='446' /></a></p>\n<p>For most of the two decades that followed, Planck continued to use similar methods to study the Second Law in various settings (e.g. elastic materials, chemical mixtures, etc.)—and meanwhile ascended the German academic physics hierarchy, ending up as a professor of theoretical physics in Berlin. Planck was in many ways a physics traditionalist, not wanting to commit to things like “newfangled” molecular ideas—and as late as 1897 (with his assistant Zermelo having made his “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-recurrence-objection'>recurrence objection</a>” to Boltzmann’s work) still saying that he would “abstain completely from any definite assumption about the nature of heat”. But regardless of its foundations, Planck was a true believer in the Second Law, for example in 1891 asserting that it “must extend to all forces of nature &#8230; not only thermal and chemical, but also electrical and other”.</p>\n<p>And in 1895 he began to investigate how the Second Law applied to electrodynamics—and in particular to the &#8220;heat radiation&#8221; that it had become clear (particularly through <a href=\"https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hertz_Heinrich/\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Heinrich Hertz</a>’s (1857–1894) experiments) was of electromagnetic origin. In 1896 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wien/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wilhelm Wien</a> (1864–1928) suggested that the heat radiation (or what we now call <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=blackbody+radiation'>blackbody radiation</a>) was in effect produced by tiny Hertzian oscillators with velocities following a Maxwell distribution.</p>\n<p>Planck, however, had a different viewpoint, instead introducing the concept of “natural radiation”—a kind of intrinsic thermal equilibrium state for radiation, with an associated intrinsic entropy. He imagined “resonators” interacting through Maxwell’s equations with this radiation, and in 1899 invented a (rather arbitrary) formula for the entropy of these resonators, that implied (through the laws of electrodynamics) that overall entropy would increase—just like the Second Law said—and when the entropy was maximized it gave the same result as Wien for the spectrum of blackbody radiation. In early 1900 he sharpened his treatment and began to suggest that with his approach Wien’s form of the blackbody spectrum would emerge as a provable consequence of the universal validity of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>But right around that time experimental results arrived that disagreed with Wien’s law. And by the end of 1900 Planck had a new hypothesis, for which he finally began to rely on ideas from Boltzmann. Planck started from the idea that he should treat the behavior of his resonators statistically. But how then could he compute their entropy? He quotes (for the first time ever) his simplification of Boltzmann’s formula for entropy:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img238.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/originalpapersin00plan/page/38/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img238.png\" width='620' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>As he <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\" target=_blank rel=noopener>explains it</a>—claiming now, after years of criticizing Boltzmann, that this is a “theorem”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">We now set the entropy <em>S</em> of the system proportional to the logarithm of its probability <em>W</em>&#8230; In my opinion this actually serves as a definition of the probability <em>W</em>, since in the basic assumptions of electromagnetic theory there is no definite evidence for such a probability. The suitability of this expression is evident from the outset, in view of its simplicity and close connection with a theorem from kinetic gas theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But how could he figure out the probability for a resonator to have a certain energy, and thus a certain entropy? For this he turns directly to Boltzmann—who, as a matter of convenience in his 1877 paper had introduced discrete values of energy for molecules. Planck simply states that it’s “necessary” (i.e. to get the experimentally right answer) to treat the resonator energy “not as a continuous, infinitely divisible quantity, but as a discrete quantity composed of an integral number of finite equal parts”. As an example of how this works he gives a table just like the one in <a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012336965?urlappend=%3Bseq=178%3Bownerid=13510798885803827-180' target=_blank rel=noopener>Boltzmann&#8217;s paper</a> from nearly a quarter of a century earlier:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img239.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img239.png\" width=\"629\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>Pretty soon he’s deriving the entropy of a resonator as a function of its energy, and its discrete energy unit ϵ:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img240.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img240.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>Connecting this to blackbody radiation he claims that each resonator’s energy unit is connected to its frequency according to</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img241.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img241.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>so that its entropy is</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img242.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img242.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>“[where] <em>h</em> and <em>k</em> are universal constants”. </p>\n<p>In a similar situation Boltzmann had effectively taken the limit ϵ&rarr;0, because that’s what he believed corresponded to (“calculus-based”) physical reality.

And in doing this it takes him only a few lines to derive what’s now called the Planck spectrum for blackbody radiation (i.e. for “radiation in equilibrium”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img243.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img243.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>And then by fitting this result to the data of the time he gets “Planck’s constant” (the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=planck%27s+constant'>correct result is 6.62</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img244.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img244.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, this was essentially the birth of quantum mechanics—essentially as a spinoff from an attempt to extend the domain of the Second Law. Planck himself didn’t seem to internalize what he’d done for at least another decade. And it was really Albert Einstein’s 1905 analysis of the photoelectric effect that made the concept of the quantization of energy that Planck had assumed (more as a calculational hypothesis than anything else) seem to be something of real physical significance—that would lead to the whole development of quantum mechanics, notably in the 1920s. </p>\n<p><!--Section 15 Are Molecules Real? Continuous Versus Discrete--></p>\n<h2 id='are-molecules-real?-continuous-versus-discrete'>Are Molecules Real? Continuous Versus Discrete</h2>\n<p>As we discussed at the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-basic-arc-of-the-story' target=_blank rel=noopener>very beginning above</a>, already in antiquity there was a notion that at least things like solids and liquids might not ultimately be continuous (as they seemed), but might instead be made of large numbers of discrete “atomic” elements. By the 1600s there was also the idea that light might be “corpuscular”—and, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-second-law-is-formulated' target=_blank rel=noopener>as we discussed above</a>, gases too. But meanwhile, there were opposing theories that espoused continuity—like the caloric theory of heat. And particularly with the success of calculus, there was a strong tendency to develop theories that showed continuity—and to which calculus could be applied. </p>\n<p>But in the early 1800s—notably with the work of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=John+Dalton'>John Dalton</a> (1766–1844)—there began to be evidence that there were discrete entities participating in chemical reactions. Meanwhile, as we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases' target=_blank rel=noopener>discussed above</a>, the success of the kinetic theory of gases gave increasing evidence for some kind of—at least effectively—discrete elements in gases. But even people like Boltzmann and Maxwell were reluctant to assert that gases really were made of molecules. And there were plenty of well-known scientists (like Ernst Mach) who “opposed atomism”, often effectively on the grounds that in science one should only talk about things one can actually see or experience—not things like atoms that were too small for that.</p>\n<p>But there was something else too: with Newton’s theory of gravitation as a precursor, and then with the investigation of electromagnetic phenomena, there emerged in the 1800s the idea of a “continuous field”. The interpretation of this was fairly clear for something like an elastic solid or a fluid that exhibited continuous deformations. </p>\n<p>Mathematically, things like gravity, magnetism—and heat—seemed to work in similar ways. And it was assumed that this meant that in all cases there had to be some fluid-like “carrier” for the field. And this is what led to ideas like the luminiferous aether as the “carrier” of electromagnetic waves. And, by the way, the idea of an aether wasn’t even obviously incompatible with the idea of atoms; Kelvin, for example, had a theory that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1043e/'>atoms were vortices (perhaps knotted) in the aether</a>. </p>\n<p>But how does this all relate to the Second Law? Well, particularly through the work of Boltzmann there came to be the impression that given atomism, probability theory could essentially “prove” the Second Law. A few people tried to clarify the formal details (as we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-second-law-is-formulated' target=_blank rel=noopener>discussed above</a>), but it seemed like any final conclusion would have to await the validation (or not) of atomism, which in the late 1800s was still a thoroughly controversial theory.</p>\n<p>By the first decade of the 1900s, however, the fortunes of atomism began to change. In 1897 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=J.J.+Thomson'>J. J. Thomson</a> (1856–1940) discovered the electron, showing that electricity was fundamentally “corpuscular”. And in 1900 Planck had (at least calculationally) introduced discrete quanta of energy. But it was the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers' target=_blank rel=noopener>three classic papers of Albert Einstein in 1905</a> that—in their different ways—began to secure the ultimate success of atomism.</p>\n<p>First there was his paper “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1905_17_1/page/132/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>On a Heuristic View about the Production and Transformation of Light</a>”, which began:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic [radiation] differs in a profound, essential way from the current theoretical models of gases and other matter. We consider the state of a material body to be completely determined by the positions and velocities of a finite number of atoms and electrons, albeit a very large number. But the electromagnetic state of a region of space is described by continuous functions &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then points out that optical experiments look only at time-averaged electromagnetic fields, and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1905_17_1/page/132/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In particular, blackbody radiation, photoluminescence, [the photoelectric effect] and other phenomena associated with the generation and transformation of light seem better modeled by assuming that the energy of light is distributed discontinuously in space. According to this picture, the energy of a light wave emitted from a point source is not spread continuously over ever larger volumes, but consists of a finite number of energy quanta that are spatially localized at points of space, move without dividing and are absorbed or generated only as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, he’s suggesting that light is “corpuscular”, and that energy is quantized. When he begins to get into details, he’s soon talking about the “entropy of radiation”—and, then, in three core sections of his paper, he’s basing what he’s doing on “Boltzmann’s principle”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img245.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1905_17_1/page/138/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img245.png\" width='584' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Two months later, Einstein produced another paper: “Investigations on the Theory of Brownian Motion”. Back in 1827 the British botanist <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Robert+Brown&#038;assumption=%7B%22C%22%2C+%22Robert+Brown%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22Person%22%7D&#038;assumption=%7B%22DPClash%22%2C+%22PersonE%22%2C+%22Robert+Brown%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22RobertBrown%3A%3Ahqyc2%22%7D'>Robert Brown</a> (1773–1858) had seen under a microscope tiny grains (ejected by pollen) randomly jiggling around in water. Einstein <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/andp.19053220806\" target=_blank rel=noopener>began his paper</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In this paper it will be shown that according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of microscopically visible size suspended in a liquid will perform movements of such magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope, on account of the molecular motions of heat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He doesn’t explicitly mention Boltzmann in this paper, but there’s Boltzmann’s formula again:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img246.png\" data-url=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/andp.19053220806\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img246.png\" width='370' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And by the next year it’s become clear experimentally that, yes, the jiggling Robert Brown had seen was in fact the result of impacts from discrete, real water molecules.</p>\n<p>Einstein’s third 1905 paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”—in which he introduced <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#deriving-special-relativity'>relativity theory</a>—wasn’t so obviously related to atomism. But in showing that the luminiferous aether will (as Einstein put it) “prove superfluous” he was removing what was (<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>almost!</a>) the last remaining example of something continuous in physics.</p>\n<p>In the years after 1905, the evidence for atomism mounted rapidly, segueing in the 1920s into the development of quantum mechanics. But what happened with the Second Law? By the time atomism was generally accepted, the generation of physicists that had included Boltzmann and Gibbs was gone. And while the Second Law was routinely invoked in expositions of thermodynamics, questions about its foundations were largely forgotten. Except perhaps for one thing: people remembered that “proofs” of the Second Law had been controversial, and had depended on the controversial hypothesis of atomism. But—they appear to have reasoned—now that atomism isn’t controversial anymore, it follows that the Second Law is indeed “satisfactorily proved”. And, after all, there were all sorts of other things to investigate in physics.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of “footnotes” to this story. The first has to do with Einstein. Right before Einstein’s remarkable series of papers in 1905, what was he working on? The answer is: the Second Law! In 1902 he wrote a paper entitled “Kinetic Theory of Thermal Equilibrium and of the Second Law of Thermodynamics”. Then in 1903: “A Theory of the Foundations of Thermodynamics”. And in 1904: “<a href=\"https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-doc/135\" target=_blank rel=noopener>On the General Molecular Theory of Heat</a>”. The latter paper claims:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I derive an expression for the entropy of a system, which is completely analogous to the one found by Boltzmann for ideal gases and assumed by Planck in his theory of radiation. Then I give a simple derivation of the Second Law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what&#8217;s actually there is not quite what&#8217;s advertised:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img247.png\" data-url=\"https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-doc/136\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img247.png\" width='470' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>It’s a short argument—about interactions between a collection of heat reservoirs. But in a sense it already assumes its answer, and certainly doesn’t provide any kind of fundamental “derivation of the Second Law”. And this was the last time Einstein ever explicitly wrote about deriving the Second Law. Yes, in those days it was just too hard, even for Einstein.</p>\n<p>There’s another footnote to this story too. As we said, at the beginning of the twentieth century it had become clear that lots of things that had been thought to be continuous were in fact discrete. But there was an important exception: space. Ever since <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Euclid</a> (~300 BC), space had almost universally been implicitly assumed to be continuous. And, yes, when quantum mechanics was being built, people did wonder about whether space might be discrete too (and even in 1917 <a href='https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/314' target=_blank rel=noopener>Einstein expressed the opinion</a> that eventually it would turn out to be). But over time the idea of continuous space (and time) got so entrenched in the fabric of physics that when I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-7--space-as-a-network'>started seriously developing</a> the ideas that became our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> based on space as a discrete network (or what—in homage to the dynamical theory of heat one might call the “dynamical theory of space”) it seemed to many people quite shocking. And looking back at the controversies of the late 1800s around atomism and its application to the Second Law it’s charming how familiar many of the arguments against atomism seem. Of course it turns out they were wrong—as they <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>seem again to be</a> in the case of space.</p>\n<p><!--Section 16 The Twentieth Century--></p>\n<h2 id='the-twentieth-century'>The Twentieth Century</h2>\n<p>The foundations of thermodynamics were a hot topic in physics in the latter half of the nineteenth century—worked on by many of the most prominent physicists of the time. But by the early twentieth century it’d been firmly eclipsed by other areas of physics. And going forward it’d receive precious little attention—with most physicists just assuming it’d “somehow been solved”, or at least “didn’t need to be worried about”. </p>\n<p>As a practical matter, thermodynamics in its basic equilibrium form nevertheless became very widely used in engineering and in chemistry. And in physics, there was steadily increasing interest in doing statistical mechanics—typically enumerating states of systems (quantum or otherwise), weighted as they would be in idealized thermal equilibrium. In mathematics, the field of ergodic theory developed, though for the most part it concerned itself with systems (such as ordinary differential equations) involving few variables—making it relevant to the Second Law essentially only by analogy.</p>\n<p>There were a few <a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_mathematische-annalen_1909_67/page/354/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>attempts to &#8220;axiomatize&#8221; the Second Law</a>, but mostly only at a macroscopic level, not asking about its microscopic origins. And there were also attempts to generalize the Second Law to make robust statements not just about equilibrium and the fact that it would be reached, but also about what would happen in systems driven to be in some manner away from equilibrium. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem about small perturbations from equilibrium—established in the mid-1900s, though anticipated in Einstein&#8217;s work on Brownian motion—was one example of a widely applicable result. And there were also related ideas of “minimum entropy production”—as well as “maximum entropy production”. But for large deviations from equilibrium there <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-6-1--history-of-emergence-of-order/'>really weren&#8217;t convincing general results</a>, and in practice most investigations basically used phenomenological models that didn&#8217;t have obvious connections to the foundations of thermodynamics, or derivations of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, through most of the twentieth century there were progressively more elaborate mathematical analyses of Boltzmann&#8217;s equation (and the <em>H</em> theorem) and their relation to rigorously derivable but hard-to-manage concepts like the BBGKY hierarchy. But despite occasional claims to the contrary, such approaches ultimately never seem to have been able to make much progress on the core problem of deriving the Second Law. </p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the story of entropy. And in a sense this had three separate threads. The first was the notion of entropy—essentially in the original form defined by Clausius—being used to talk quantitatively about heat in equilibrium situations, usually for either engineering or chemistry. The second—that we&#8217;ll discuss a little more below—was entropy as a qualitative characterization of randomness and degradation. And the third was entropy as a general and formal way to measure the &#8220;effective number of degrees of freedom&#8221; in a system, computed from the log of the number of its achievable states.</p>\n<p>There are definitely correspondences between these different threads. But they&#8217;re in no sense &#8220;obviously equivalent”. And much of the mystery—and confusion—that developed around entropy in the twentieth century came from conflating them. </p>\n<p>Another piece of the story was information theory, which arose in the 1940s. And a core question in information theory is how long an &#8220;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-5--history-of-data-compression/'>optimally compressed</a>&#8221; message will be. And (with various assumptions) the average such length is given by a ∑<em>p</em> log <em>p</em> form that has essentially the same structure as Boltzmann&#8217;s expression for entropy. But even though it&#8217;s &#8220;mathematically like entropy&#8221; this has nothing immediately to do with heat—or even physics; it&#8217;s just an abstract consequence of needing log Ω bits (i.e. log Ω degrees of freedom) to specify one of Ω possibilities. (Still, the coincidence of definitions led to an &#8220;entropy branding&#8221; for various essentially information-theoretic methods, with claims sometimes being made that, for example, the thing called <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-9--estimation-of-parameters-in-probabilistic-models/'>entropy must always be maximized</a> &#8220;because we know that from physics&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>There&#8217;d been an initial thought in the 1940s that there&#8217;d be an &#8220;inevitable Second Law&#8221; for systems that &#8220;did computation&#8221;. The argument was that logical gates (like And and Or) take 2 bits of input (with 4 overall states 11, 10, 01, 00) but give only 1 bit of output (1 or 0), and are therefore fundamentally irreversible. But in the 1970s it became clear that it&#8217;s perfectly possible to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-2--reversible-computation/'>do computation reversibly</a> (say with 2-input, 2-output gates)—and indeed this is what&#8217;s used in the typical formalism for quantum circuits.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>mentioned elsewhere</a>, there were some computer experiments in the 1950s and beyond on model systems—like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>hard sphere gases</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>nonlinear springs</a>—that showed some sign of Second Law behavior (though less than might have been expected). But the analysis of these systems very much concentrated on various regularities, and not on the effective randomness associated with Second Law behavior. </p>\n<p>In another direction, the 1970s saw the application of thermodynamic ideas to black holes. At first, it was basically a pure analogy. But then quantum field theory calculations <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-16--vacuum-fluctuations/'>suggested that black holes should produce thermal radiation</a> as if they had a certain effective temperature. By the late 1990s there were more direct ways to &#8220;compute entropy&#8221; for black holes, by enumerating possible (quantum) configurations consistent with the overall characteristics of the black hole. But such computations in effect assume (time-invariant) equilibrium, and so can&#8217;t be expected to shed light directly on the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Talking about black holes brings up gravity. And in the course of the twentieth century there were scattered efforts to understand the effect of gravity on the Second Law. Would a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1021b/'>self-gravitating gas</a> achieve &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; in the usual sense? Does gravity violate the Second Law? It&#8217;s been difficult to get definitive answers. Many specific simulations of <em>n</em>-body gravitational systems were done, but without global conclusions for the Second Law. And there were cosmological arguments, particularly about the role of gravity in accounting for entropy in the early universe—but not so much about the actual evolution of the universe and the effect of the Second Law on it. </p>\n<p>Yet another direction has involved quantum mechanics. The standard formalism of quantum mechanics—like classical mechanics—is fundamentally reversible. But the formalism for measurement introduced in the 1930s—arguably as something of a hack—is fundamentally irreversible, and there&#8217;ve been continuing arguments about whether this could perhaps &#8220;explain the Second Law&#8221;. (I think our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>Physics Project finally provides more clarity</a> about what&#8217;s going on here—but also tells us this isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s &#8220;needed&#8221; for the Second Law.)</p>\n<p>From the earliest days of the Second Law, there had always been scattered but ultimately unconvincing assertions of exceptions to the Second Law—usually based on elaborately constructed machines that were claimed to be able to achieve perpetual motion &#8220;just powered by heat&#8221;. Of course, the Second Law is a claim about large numbers of molecules, etc.—and shouldn&#8217;t be expected to apply to very small systems. But by the end of the twentieth century it was starting to be possible to make micromachines that could operate on small numbers of molecules (or electrons). And with the right control systems in place, it was argued that such machines could—at least in principle—effectively be used to set up Maxwell&#8217;s demons that would systematically violate the Second Law, albeit on a very small scale.</p>\n<p>And then there was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-mechanoidal-phase-and-bulk-molecular-biology' target=_blank rel=noopener>the question of life</a>. Early formulations of the Second Law had tended to talk about applying only to &#8220;inanimate matter”—because somehow living systems didn&#8217;t seem to follow the same process of inexorable &#8220;dissipation to heat&#8221; as inanimate, mechanical systems. And indeed, quite to the contrary, they seemed able to take disordered input (like food) and generate ordered biological structures from it. And indeed, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Schrodinger/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Erwin Schrödinger</a> (1887–1961), in his 1944 book <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/whatislifephysic0000schr/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>What Is Life?</a></em> talked about &#8220;negative entropy&#8221; associated with life. But he—and many others since—argue that life doesn&#8217;t really violate the Second Law because it&#8217;s not operating in a closed environment where one should expect evolution to equilibrium. Instead, it&#8217;s constantly being driven away from equilibrium, for example by &#8220;organized energy&#8221; ultimately coming from the Sun.</p>\n<p>Still, the concept of at least locally “antithermodynamic” behavior is often considered to be a potential <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--defining-life/'>general signature of life</a>. But already by the early part of the 1900s, with the rise of things like biochemistry, and the decline of concepts like “life force” (which seemed a little like “caloric”), there developed a strong belief that the Second Law must at some level always apply, even to living systems. But, yes, even though the Second Law seemed to say that one can’t “unscramble an egg”, there was still the witty rejoinder: “unless you feed it to a chicken”. </p>\n<p>What about biological evolution? Well, Boltzmann had been an enthusiast of Darwin’s idea of natural selection. And—although it’s not clear he made this connection—it was pointed out many times in the twentieth century that just as in the Second Law reversible underlying dynamics generate an irreversible overall effect, so also in Darwinian evolution effectively reversible individual changes aggregate to what at least <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-5--history-of-biological-complexity/'>Darwin thought was an &#8220;irreversible&#8221; progression</a> to things like the formation of higher organisms.</p>\n<p>The Second Law also found its way into the social sciences—sometimes under names like “entropy pessimism”—most often being used to justify the necessity of “Maxwell’s-demon-like” active intervention or control to prevent the collapse of economic or social systems into random or incoherent states. </p>\n<p>But despite all these applications of the Second Law, the twentieth century largely passed without significant advances in understanding the origin and foundations of the Second Law. Though even by the early 1980s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#statistical-mechanics-and-simple-programs' target=_blank rel=noopener>I was beginning to find results</a>—based on computational ideas—that seemed as if they might finally give a foundational understanding of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>what&#8217;s really happening in the Second Law</a>, and the extent to which the Second Law can in the end be “derived” from underlying “mechanical” rules.</p>\n<p><!--Section 17 What the Textbooks Said: The Evolution of Certainty--></p>\n<h2 id='what-the-textbooks-said:-the-evolution-of-certainty'>What the Textbooks Said: The Evolution of Certainty</h2>\n<p>Ask a typical physicist today about the Second Law and they’re likely to be very sure that it’s “just true”. Maybe they’ll consider it “another law of nature” like the conservation of energy, or maybe they’ll think it is something that was “proved long ago” from basic principles of mathematics and mechanics. But as we’ve discussed here, there’s really nowhere in the history of the Second Law that should give us this degree of certainty. So where did all the certainty come from? I think in the end it’s a mixture of a kind of don’t-question-this-it-comes-from-sophisticated-science mystique about the Second Law, together with a century and a half of “increasingly certain” textbooks. So let’s talk about the textbooks.</p>\n<p>While early contributions to what we now call thermodynamics (and particularly those from continental Europe) often got published as monographs, the first “actual textbooks” of thermodynamics already started to appear in the 1860s, with three examples (curiously, all in French) being:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img248.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/principesdether00saingoog/page/n10/mode/1up?ref=ol&#038;view=theater\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img248.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And in these early textbooks what one repeatedly sees is that the Second Law is simply cited—without much comment—as a &#8220;principle&#8221; or &#8220;axiom&#8221; (variously attributed to Carnot, Kelvin or Clausius, and sometimes called “the Principle of Carnot&#8221;), from which theory will be developed. By the 1870s there&#8217;s a bit of confusion starting to creep in, because people are talking about the &#8220;Theorem of Carnot&#8221;. But, at least at first, by this they mean not the Second Law, but the result on the efficiency of heat engines that Carnot derived from this.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, there are questions in textbooks about the validity of the Second Law. A notable one, that we discussed above when we talked about Maxwell’s demon, shows up under the title “Limitation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics” at the end of Maxwell’s 1871 <em>Theory of Heat</em>.</p>\n<p>Tait’s largely historical 1877 <em>Sketch of Thermodynamics</em> notes that, yes, the Second Law hasn’t successfully been proved from the laws of mechanics:</p>\n<p><a

actually “proved the Second Law”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img251.png\"

Law, but then talks about “molecular hypotheses from which Carnot’s principle has been derived”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\"

confusion like the section in Alexandre Gouilly’s (1842–1906) 1877 <em>Mechanical Theory of Heat</em> that’s entitled “Second Fundamental Theorem of Thermodynamics or the Theorem of Carnot”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img253.png\"

practical expositions (that are often incredibly similar to each other) with no particular theoretical discussion of the Second Law, its origins or validity. </p>\n<p>In 1891 there’s an “official

In 1895 Boltzmann published his <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lectures on Gas Theory</a></em>, which includes a final chapter about the <em>H</em> theorem and its relation to the Second Law. Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/n421/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>goes through</a> his mathematical derivations for gases, then (rather over-optimistically) asserts that they&#8217;ll also work for solids and liquids:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">We have looked mainly at processes in gases and have calculated the function <em>H</em> for this case. Yet the laws of probability that govern atomic motion in the solid and liquid states are clearly not qualitatively different &#8230; from those for gases, so that the calculation of the function <em>H</em> corresponding to the entropy would not be more difficult in principle, although to be sure it would involve greater mathematical difficulties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But soon he’s <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/n421/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>discussing the more philosophical aspects of things</a> (and by the time Boltzmann wrote this book, he was a professor of philosophy as well as physics). He says that the usual statement of the Second Law is “asserted phenomenologically as an axiom” (just as he says the infinite divisibility of matter also is at that time):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; the Second Law is formulated in such a way that the unconditional irreversibility of all natural processes is asserted as an axiom, just as general physics based on a purely phenomenological standpoint asserts the unconditional divisibility of matter without limit as an axiom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One might then expect him to say that actually the Second Law is somehow provable from basic physical facts, such as the First Law. But actually his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/10/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>claims</a> about any kind of “general derivation” of the Second Law are rather subdued:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Since however the probability calculus has been verified in so many special cases, I see no reason why it should not also be applied to natural processes of a more general kind. The applicability of the probability calculus to the molecular motion in gases cannot of course be rigorously deduced from the differential equations for the motion of the molecules. It follows rather from the great number of the gas molecules and the length of their paths, by virtue of which the properties of the position in the gas where a molecule undergoes a collision are completely independent of the place where it collided the previous time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But he still believes in the ultimate applicability of the Second Law, and feels he needs to <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\\npage/n422/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>explain why</a>—in the face of the Second Law—the universe as we perceive “still has interesting things going on”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; small isolated regions of the universe will always find themselves “initially” in an improbable state. This method seems to me to be the only way in which one can understand the Second Law—the heat death of each single world—without a unidirectional change of the entire universe from a definite initial state to a final state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/10/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>talks about the idea</a> that elsewhere in the universe things might be different—and that, for example, entropy might be systematically decreasing, making (he suggests) perceived time run backwards:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In the entire universe, the aggregate of all individual worlds, there will however in fact<br />\noccur processes going in the opposite direction. But the beings who observe such processes will simply reckon time as proceeding from the less probable to the more probable states, and it will never be discovered whether they reckon time differently from us, since they are separated from us by eons of time and spatial distances 10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup> times the distance of Sirius—and moreover their language has no relation to ours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most other textbook discussions of thermodynamics are tamer than this, but the rather anthropic-style argument that “we live in a fluctuation” comes up over and over again as an ultimate way to explain the fact that the universe as we perceive it isn’t just a featureless maximum-entropy place.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are roughly three general streams of textbooks that end up discussing the Second Law. There are books about rather practical thermodynamics (of the type pioneered by Clausius), that typically spend most of their time on the equilibrium case. There are books about kinetic theory (effectively pioneered by Maxwell), that typically spend most of their time talking about the dynamics of gas molecules. And then there are books about statistical mechanics (as pioneered by Gibbs) that discuss with various degrees of mathematical sophistication the statistical characteristics of ensembles. </p>\n<p>In each of these streams, many textbooks just treat the Second Law as a starting point that can be taken for granted, then go from there. But particularly when they are written by physicists with broader experience, or when they are intended for a not-totally-specialized audience, textbooks will quite often attempt at least a little justification or explanation for the Second Law—though rather often with a distinct sleight of hand involved.</p>\n<p>For example, when Planck in 1903 wrote his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.154233/page/n7/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Treatise on Thermodynamics</a> he had a chapter in his discussion of the Second Law, misleadingly entitled &#8220;Proof&#8221;. Still, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich/page/86/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>he explains that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The second fundamental principle of thermodynamics [Second Law] being, like the first, an empirical law, we can speak of its proof only in so far as its total purport may be deduced from a single self-evident proposition. We, therefore, put forward the following proposition as being given directly by experience. It is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle, and produce no effect except the raising of a weight and the cooling of a heat-reservoir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, his “proof” of the Second Law is that nobody has ever managed to build a perpetual motion machine that violates it. (And, yes, this is more than a little reminiscent of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--p-versus-np-questions/'><em>P</em> ≠ <em>NP</em></a>, which, through computational irreducibility, is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#why-the-second-law-works'>related to the Second Law</a>.) But after many pages, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich/page/102/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>he says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In conclusion, we shall briefly discuss the question of the possible limitations to the Second Law. If there exist any such limitations—a view still held by many scientists and philosophers—then this [implies an error] in our starting point: the impossibility of perpetual motion &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(In the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.154233/page/n119/mode/\\\n2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>1905 edition of the book he adds a footnote</a> that frankly seems bizarre in view of his—albeit perhaps initially unwilling—role in the initiation of quantum theory five years earlier: &#8220;The following discussion, of course, deals with the meaning of the Second Law only insofar as it can be surveyed from the points of view contained in this work avoiding all atomic hypotheses.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>He ends by <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich/page/104/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>basically saying</a> &#8220;maybe one day the Second Law will be considered necessarily true; in the meantime let&#8217;s assume it and see if anything goes wrong&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Presumably the time will come when the principle of the increase of the entropy will be presented without any connection with experiment. Some metaphysicians may even put it forward as being <em>a priori</em> valid. In the meantime, no more effective weapon can be used by both champions and opponents of the Second Law than the indefatigable endeavour to follow the real purport of this law to the utmost consequences, taking the latter one by one to the highest court of appeal experience.

A notable example was in <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Eddington/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Arthur Eddington</a>’s (1882–1944) 1929 <em>The Nature of the Physical World</em>—where now the Second Law is exalted as having the “supreme position among the laws of Nature”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img16.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/natureofphysical00eddi/page/74/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img16.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Although Eddington does admit that the Second Law is probably not “mathematically derivable”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img17.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/natureofphysical00eddi/page/76/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img17.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And even though in the twentieth century questions about thermodynamics and the Second Law weren’t considered “top physics topics”, some top physicists did end up talking about them, if nothing else in general textbooks they wrote. Thus, for example, in the 1930s and 1940s people like <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermi/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Enrico Fermi</a> (1901–1954) and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Pauli/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfgang Pauli</a> (1900–1958) wrote in some detail about the Second Law—though rather strenuously avoided discussing foundational issues about it. </p>\n<p><a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lev Landau</a> (1908–1968), however, was a different story. In 1933 he wrote a paper “<a href='https://archive.org/details/d.-ter-haar-collected-papers-of-l.-d.-landau/page/69/mode/1up?q=69' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Universe</a>” which basically argues that our everyday experience is only possible because “the world as a whole does not obey the laws of thermodynamics”—and suggests that perhaps relativistic quantum mechanics (which he says, quoting <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bohr_Niels/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Niels Bohr</a> (1885–1962), could be crucial in the center of stars) might fundamentally violate the Second Law. (And yes, even today it’s not clear how “relativistic temperature” works.)</p>\n<p>But this kind of outright denial of the Second Law had disappeared by the time Lev Landau and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lifshitz/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Evgeny Lifshitz</a> (1915–1985) wrote the 1951 version of their book <em>Statistical Mechanics</em>—though they still <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n40/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>showed skepticism</a> about its origins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">There is no doubt that the foregoing simple formulations [of the Second Law] accord with reality; they are confirmed by all our everyday observations. But when we consider more closely the problem of the physical nature and origin of these laws of behaviour, substantial difficulties arise, which to some extent have not yet been overcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Their book <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n40/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>, discussing Boltzmann’s fluctuation argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Firstly, if we attempt to apply statistical physics to the entire universe &#8230; we immediately encounter a glaring contradiction between theory and experiment. According to the results of statistics, the universe ought to be in a state of complete statistical equilibrium. &#8230; Everyday experience shows us, however, that the properties of Nature bear no resemblance to those of an equilibrium system; and astronomical results show that the same is true throughout the vast region of the Universe accessible to our observation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">We might try to overcome this contradiction by supposing that the part of the Universe which we observe is just some huge fluctuation in a system which is in equilibrium as a whole. The fact that we have been able to observe this huge fluctuation might be explained by supposing that the existence of such a fluctuation is a necessary condition for the existence of an observer (a condition for the occurrence of biological evolution). This argument, however, is easily disproved, since a fluctuation within, say, the volume of the solar system only would be very much more probable, and would be sufficient to allow the existence of an observer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What do they think is the way out? The <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n40/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>effect of gravity</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; in the general theory of relativity, the Universe as a whole must be regarded not as a closed system but as a system in a variable gravitational field. Consequently the application of the law of increase of entropy does not prove that statistical equilibrium must necessarily exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But they say this isn’t the end of the problem, essentially noting the reversibility objection. How should this be overcome? First, they suggest the solution might be that the observer somehow “artificially closes off the history of a system”, but then they add:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Such a dependence of the laws of physics on the nature of an observer is quite inadmissible, of course.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n41/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continue</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">At the present time it is not certain whether the law of increase of entropy thus formulated can be derived on the basis of classical mechanics. &#8230; It is more reasonable to suppose that the law of increase of entropy in the above general formulation arises from quantum effects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They talk about the interaction of classical and quantum systems, and what amounts to the explicit irreversibility of the traditional formalism of quantum measurement, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n42/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>then say</a> that if quantum mechanics is in fact the ultimate source of irreversibility:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; there must exist an inequality involving the quantum constant ℏ which ensures the validity of the law and is satisfied in the real world&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about other textbooks? <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Edward_Mayer' target=_blank rel=noopener>Joseph Mayer</a> (1904–1983) and <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Maria+Goeppert+Mayer' target=_blank rel=noopener>Maria Goeppert Mayer</a>’s (1906–1972) 1940 <em>Statistical Mechanics</em> has the rather charming</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img18.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n15/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img18.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>though in the end they sidestep difficult questions about the Second Law by basically making convenient definitions of what <em>S</em> and Ω mean in <em>S</em> = <em>k</em> log Ω.</p>\n<p>For a long time one of the most cited textbooks in the area was <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Richard+Tolman'>Richard Tolman</a>’s (1881–1948) 1938 <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Principles of Statistical Mechanics</a></em>. Tolman (basically following Gibbs) begins by explaining that statistical mechanics is about making predictions when all you know are probabilistic statements about initial conditions:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img19.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/principlesofstat0000tolm/page/n22/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img19.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Tolman continues:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img20.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n15/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img20.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He notes that, historically, statistical mechanics was developed for studying systems like gases, where (in a vague foreshadowing of the concept of computational irreducibility) “it is evident that we should be quickly lost in the complexities of our computations” if we try to trace every molecule, but where, he claims, statistical mechanics can still accurately tell us “statistically” what will happen:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img21.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n17/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img21.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But where exactly should we get the probability distributions for initial states from? Tolman says he’s going to consider the kinds of mathematically defined ensembles that Gibbs discusses. And tucked away at the end of a chapter he admits that, well, yes, this setup is really all just a postulate—set up so as to make the results of statistical mechanics “merely a matter for computation”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img22.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n83/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img22.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>On this basis Tolman then derives Boltzmann’s <em>H</em> theorem, and his <img style=\"margin-bottom: -6px\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/sw18history1423img32.png\" width= '15' height='22'> “coarse-grained” generalization (where, yes, the coarse-graining ultimately operates according to his postulate). For 530 pages, there’s not a single mention of the Second Law. But finally, on page 558 Tolman is at least prepared to talk about an “analog of the Second Law”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img23.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n573/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img23.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And basically what Tolman argues is that his <img style=\"margin-bottom: -6px\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/sw18history1423img32.png\" width= '15' height='22'> can reasonably be identified with thermodynamic entropy <em>S</em>.

Wanting to make use of the Second Law, but concerned about the reversibility objections, Reichenbach introduces the notion of “branch systems”—essentially parts of the universe that can eventually be considered isolated, but which were once connected to other parts that were responsible for determining their (“nonrandom”) effective initial conditions:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img27.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/directionoftimee0000reic/page/119/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img27.png\" width='403' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Most textbooks that cover the Second Law use one of the formulations that we’ve already discussed. But there is one more formulation that also sometimes appears, usually associated with the name &#8220;Carathéodory&#8221; or the term “axiomatic thermodynamics”. </p>\n<p>Back in the first decade of the twentieth century—particularly in the circle around <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/' target=_blank rel=noopener>David Hilbert</a> (1862–1943)—there was a lot of enthusiasm for axiomatizing things, including physics. And in 1908 the mathematician <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Caratheodory/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Constantin Carathéodory</a> (1873–1950) suggested an axiomatization of thermodynamics. His essential idea—that he developed further in the 1920s—was to consider something like Gibbs’s phase fluid and then roughly to assert that it gets (in some measure-theoretic sense) “so mixed up” that there aren’t “experimentally doable” transformations that can unmix it. Or, in his <a href='https://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>original formulation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In any arbitrary neighborhood of an arbitrarily given initial point there is a state that cannot be arbitrarily approximated by adiabatic changes of state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There wasn’t much pickup of this approach—though <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Born/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Max Born</a> (1882–1970) supported it, Max Planck dismissed it, and in 1939 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chandrasekhar/' target=_blank rel=noopener>S. Chandrasekhar</a> (1910–1995) based his <a href='https://archive.org/details/introductiontost0000chan/page/24/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>exposition of stellar structure</a> on it. But in various forms, the approach did make it into a few textbooks. An example is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Pippard' target=_blank rel=noopener>Brian Pippard</a>’s (1920–2008) otherwise rather practical 1957 <em>The Elements of Classical Thermodynamics</em>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img28.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementsofclassi0000abpi_q7i4/page/30/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img28.png\" width='594' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Yet another (loosely related) approach is the “postulatory formulation” on which <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Herbert+Callen'>Herbert Callen</a>’s (1919–1993) 1959 textbook <em>Thermodynamics</em> is based:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img29.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/thermodynamicsin0000call/page/n11/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img29.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In effect this is now “assuming the result” of the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img30.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/thermodynamicsin0000call/page/24/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img30.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Though in an appendix he rather tautologically states:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img31.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/thermodynamicsin0000call/page/317/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img31.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>So what about other textbooks? A famous set are <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Feynman/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Richard Feynman</a>’s (1918–1988) 1963 <em>Lectures on Physics</em>. Feynman starts his discussion of the Second Law quite carefully, describing it as a “hypothesis”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img32.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/444/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img32.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Feynman says he’s not going to go very far into thermodynamics, though quotes (and criticizes) Clausius’s statements:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img33.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/452/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img33.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But then he launches into a whole chapter on “Ratchet and pawl”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img34.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/464/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img34.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>His goal, he explains, is to analyze a device (similar to what Marian Smoluchowski <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#maxwell&rsquo;s-demon' target=_blank rel=noopener>had considered in 1912</a>) that one might think by its one-way ratchet action would be able to “harvest random heat” and violate the Second Law. But after a few pages of analysis he claims that, no, if the system is in equilibrium, thermal fluctuations will prevent systematic “one-way” mechanical work from being achieved, so that the Second Law is saved.</p>\n<p>But now he applies this to Maxwell’s demon, claiming that the same basic argument shows that the demon can’t work:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img35.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/468/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img35.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But what about reversibility? Feynman first discusses what amounts to Boltzmann&#8217;s fluctuation idea:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img36.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/472/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img36.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But then he opts instead for the argument that for some reason—then unknown—the universe started in a “low-entropy” state, and has been “running down” ever since:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img37.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/472/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img37.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>By the beginning of the 1960s an immense number of books had appeared that discussed the Second Law. Some were based on macroscopic thermodynamics, some on kinetic theory and some on statistical mechanics. In all three of these cases there was elegant mathematical theory to be described, even if it never really addressed the ultimate origin of the Second Law. </p>\n<p>But by the early 1960s there was something new on the scene: computer simulation. And in 1965 that formed the core of <a href='https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/in-memoriam/files/frederick-reif.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fred Reif</a>’s (1927–2019) textbook <em>Statistical Physics</em>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img259.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img259.png\" width=\"582\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>In a sense the book is an exploration of what simulated hard sphere gases do—as analyzed using ideas from statistical mechanics. (The simulations had computational limitations, but they could go far enough to meaningfully see most of the basic phenomena of statistical mechanics.)</p>\n<p>Even the front and back covers of the book provide a bold statement of both reversibility and the kind of randomization that’s at the heart of the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img260.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img260.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But inside the book the formal concept of entropy doesn&#8217;t appear until page 147—where it&#8217;s defined very concretely in terms of states one can explicitly enumerate:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img261.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img261.png\" width=\"582\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>And finally, on page 283—after all necessary definitions have been built up—there’s a rather prosaic statement of the Second Law, almost as a technical footnote:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img262.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img262.png\" width=\"380\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Looking though many textbooks of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics it’s striking how singular Reif’s “show-don’t-tell” computer-simulation approach is. And, as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>I describe in detail elsewhere</a>, for me personally it has a particular significance, because this is the book that in 1972, at the age of 12, launched me on what has now been a 50-year journey to understand the Second Law and its origins. </p>\n<p>When the first textbooks that described the Second Law were published nearly a century and a half ago they often (though even then not always) expressed uncertainty about the Second Law and just how it was supposed to work. But it wasn’t long before the vast majority of books either just “assumed the Second Law” and got on with whatever they wanted to apply it to, or tried to suggest that the Second Law had been established from underlying principles, but that it was a sophisticated story that was “out of the scope of this book” but to be found elsewhere. And so it was that a strong sense emerged that the Second Law was something whose ultimate character and origins the typical working scientist didn’t need to question—and should just believe (and protect) as part of the <a href='https://archive.org/details/twoculturesscien00snow/page/16/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>standard canon of science</a>.</p>\n<p><!--Section 18 So Where Does This Leave the Second Law?--></p>\n<h2 id='so-where-does-this-leave-the-second-law?'>So Where Does This Leave the Second Law?</h2>\n<p>The Second Law is now more than 150 years old. But—at least until now—I think it’s fair to say that the fundamental ideas used to discuss it haven’t materially changed in more than a century. There’s a lot that’s been written about the Second Law. But it’s always tended to follow lines of development already defined over a century ago—and mostly those from Clausius, or Boltzmann, or Gibbs.</p>\n<p>Looking at word clouds of titles of the thousands of publications about the Second Law over the decades we see just a few trends, like the appearance of the “generalized Second Law” in the 1990s relating to black holes:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img260_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img263.png\" alt='' title='' width='592' height='245'> </div>\n<p>But with all this activity why hasn’t more been worked out about the Second Law? How come after all this time we still don’t really even understand with clarity the correspondence between the Clausius, Boltzmann and Gibbs approaches—or how their respective definitions of “entropy” are ultimately related? </p>\n<p>In the end, I think the answer is that it needs a new paradigm—that, yes, is fundamentally based on computation and on ideas like computational irreducibility. A little more than a century ago—with people still actively arguing about what Boltzmann was saying—I don’t think anyone would have been too surprised to find out that to make progress would need a new way of looking at things. (After all, just a few years earlier Boltzmann and Gibbs had needed to bring in the new idea of using probability theory.)</p>\n<p>But as we discussed, by the beginning of the twentieth century—with other areas of physics heating up—interest in the Second Law was waning. And even with many questions unresolved people moved on. And soon several academic generations had passed. And as is typical in the history of science, by that point nobody was questioning the foundations anymore. In the particular case of the Second Law there was some sense that the uncertainties had to do with the assumption of the existence of molecules, which had by then been established. But more important, I think, was just the passage of “academic time” and the fact that what might once have been a matter of discussion had now just become a statement in the textbooks—that future academic generations should learn and didn’t need to question.</p>\n<p>One of the unusual features of the Second Law is that at the time it passed into the “standard canon of science” it was still rife with controversy. How did those different approaches relate? What about those “mathematical objections”? What about the thought experiments that seemed to suggest exceptions? It wasn’t that these issues were resolved. It was just that after enough time had passed people came to assume that “somehow that must have all been worked out ages ago”. </p>\n<p>And it wasn’t that there was really any pressure to investigate foundational issues. The Second Law—particularly in its implications for thermal equilibrium—seemed to work just fine in all its standard applications. And it even seemed to work in new domains like black holes. Yes, there was always a desire to extend it. But the difficulties encountered in trying to do so didn’t seem in any obvious way related to issues about its foundations.</p>\n<p>Of course, there were always a few people who kept wondering about the Second Law. And indeed I’ve been surprised at how much of a <em>Who’s Who</em> of twentieth-century physics this seems to have included. But while many well-known physicists seem to have privately thought about the foundations of the Second Law they managed to make remarkably little progress—and as a result left very few visible records of their efforts.</p>\n<p>But—as is so often the case—the issue, I believe, is that a fundamentally new paradigm was needed in order to make real progress. When the “standard canon” of the Second Law was formed in the latter part of the nineteenth century, calculus was the primary tool for physics—with probability theory a newfangled addition introduced specifically for studying the Second Law. And from that time it would be many decades before even the beginnings of the computational paradigm began to emerge, and nearly a century before phenomena like computational irreducibility were finally discovered. Had the sequence been different I have no doubt that what I have now been able to understand about the Second Law would have been worked out by the likes of Boltzmann, Maxwell and Kelvin. </p>\n<p>But as it is, we’ve had to wait more than a century to get to this point. And having now studied the history of the Second Law—and seen the tangled manner in which it developed—I believe that we can now be confident that we have indeed successfully been able to resolve many of the core issues and mysteries that have plagued the Second Law and its foundations over the course of nearly 150 years.</p>\n<p><span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c42c1f\"><em>Note</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Almost all of what I say here is based on my reading of primary literature, assisted by modern tools and by my latest understanding of the Second Law.

Parce que dès septembre ça redémarre fort avec la rentrée scolaire, etc. Mais en attendant, reposons-nous les doigts&nbsp;pieds en éventail et parlons de notre sécurité en ligne avec l&rsquo;antivirus de Surfshark.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Offre promotionnelle du moment : activez Surfshark antivirus pour 3.49€/mois, soit 76% d&rsquo;économies sur l&rsquo;abonnement 1 an !</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous suivez ce site depuis ses débuts (il y a presque 20 ans), vous savez que j&rsquo;ai&nbsp;souvent parlé des différentes menaces qui apparaissaient sur la toile. D&rsquo;ailleurs je me suis prêté à un petit exercice que seuls les vieux peuvent se permettre de faire sur leur propre site : j&rsquo;ai fouillé dans <a href=\"https://korben.info/category/infos/securite\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/category/infos/securite\">mes archives sécu</a> pour voir un peu comment la sécurité à évoluée entre 2004 et aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certaines menaces ont bien sûr disparu, d&rsquo;autres ont vu le jour et certaines existent toujours malgré les années. On va faire le tour de tout ça et voir comment Surfshark vous permet de vous en protéger. Non seulement avec son antivirus, mais aussi avec le reste de suite de services comme&nbsp;<a href=\"https://korben.info/partez-en-vacances-avec-surfshark-vpn.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/partez-en-vacances-avec-surfshark-vpn.html\">son VPN</a> (dont je vous parle régulièrement), son système d&rsquo;alerte, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Malware,&nbsp;logiciels espions&nbsp;&amp; ransomware&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On va commencer par ce qui reste sans doute l&rsquo;une des plus grandes familles de&nbsp;menaces à l&rsquo;heure actuelle. Il est bien loin le temps où vous étiez contaminé&nbsp;via <a href=\"https://korben.info/le-premier-pv-malware-est-arrive.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/le-premier-pv-malware-est-arrive.html\">une fausse contravention</a>&nbsp;reçue afin de&nbsp;vous faire installer un logiciel malveillant (j&rsquo;avais prévenu, j&rsquo;ai retrouvé quelques anciennes pépites vintage).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"204\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kbn.im/surfshark-antivirus\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée de ces infections est de contaminer votre système&nbsp;via un matériel hardware (genre clé USB), un document&nbsp;ou un téléchargement&nbsp;vérolé, de faire&nbsp;planter votre réseau et/ou de récupérer des données sensibles à votre insu. C&rsquo;est déjà pénible lorsque ça vous arrive en tant que particulier, mais ça l&rsquo;est encore plus pour une organisation. Voir c&rsquo;est carrément dangereux si vous gérez des informations très personnelles ou permettant d&rsquo;identifier des gens avec une grande précision (documents médicaux, impôts &#8230;).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les ransomwares&nbsp;(oui en français ont dit rançongiciels, mais &#8230; beuuurk) sont un peu comme le stade supérieur&nbsp;des malwares, sorte d&rsquo;évolution dans Pokémon. Ils vont être capables de chiffrer vos fichiers de manière à ce que vous ne puissiez plus y accéder, puis vous demander une rançon afin de vous débloquer tout ça. Ils visent le plus souvent les entreprises (qui peuvent payer plus), mais pas toujours.&nbsp;Vous vous rappelez&nbsp;de Wannacry il y a 6 ans&nbsp;? En cause, une faille Windows qui touchait tous les systèmes, incluant les particuliers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chevaux de Troie / Trojans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Une&nbsp;sous-catégorie de&nbsp;la catégorie précédente, à la différence que l&rsquo;infection se fait le plus souvent via un logiciel malveillant. Vous téléchargez un outil ressemblant à l&rsquo;original, mais dans lequel un programme malicieux est incorporé. Vous pensiez&nbsp;gratter quelques euros&nbsp;en récupérant en outil payant de manière gratuite ? Bravo&nbsp;jeunes&nbsp;rebelzzz, vous avez même&nbsp;eu droit&nbsp;un petit&nbsp;bonus gratuit 😉</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"384\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l2Sqb9bZGvtTaHWNi/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Botnets et DDoS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>De nombreux appareils connectés à Internet, et non protégés ou ayant téléchargé une application malsaine,&nbsp;ont été contaminés par&nbsp;divers virus au fil des années. Un botnet est une collection de machines ayant été infectées et formant un réseau. Ce réseau&nbsp;peut&nbsp;alors être utilisé pour envoyer des&nbsp;requêtes (et faire tomber des sites) ou des messages par milliers (par exemple des mails de phishing). Dans le cas présent la menace n&rsquo;est pas directe, mais une protection aurait pu empêcher&nbsp;ces appareils de propager&nbsp;virus et compagnie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">L&rsquo;hameçonnage aka Phishing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Un autre type de menace assez ancienne, mais elle a pris encore plus d&rsquo;ampleur ces dernières années avec l&rsquo;arrivée des cryptos. Le domaine est particulièrement ciblé, car certains s&rsquo;y lancent sans trop savoir ce qu&rsquo;ils font et sont donc des cibles de choix&nbsp;(non Metamask ne vous contactera jamais, non Trustwallet ne vous demandera jamais votre clé privée &#8230;).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"250\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/8eteLyVqRlL1AOz7Uz/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Le but ici est de faire passer pour crédible une communication&nbsp;du site auquel les vilains veulent avoir accès (banques, plateformes crypto/bourse &#8230;). Que ce soit en vous balançant un mail ou via une communication sur les réseaux sociaux, souvent avec un certain degré d&rsquo;urgence (« Cliquez vite sinon votre portefeuille risque d&rsquo;être bloqué pour toujouuuuurs »).&nbsp;Ou même de vous&nbsp;gruger avec un nom de domaine qui&nbsp;est écrit&nbsp;avec des&nbsp;caractères différents (<a href=\"https://korben.info/se-proteger-contre-attaques-de-phishing-utilisent-noms-de-domaine-dautres-alphabets.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/se-proteger-contre-attaques-de-phishing-utilisent-noms-de-domaine-dautres-alphabets.html\">attaque homographique</a>).&nbsp;Vous cliquez sur le lien envoyé ou vous vous rendez sur le site, vous entrez vos identifiants et boom le piège se referme. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cryptojacking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le cryptojacking est une menace qui semblait un peu passée de mode après avoir&nbsp;pas mal fait parler d&rsquo;elle autour de 2018. Il s&rsquo;agissait de vous faire installer une application quelconque (sur votre&nbsp;navigateur par exemple) qui minait de la crypto (surtout du Monero) à votre insu&nbsp;en arrière-plan. Les principaux navigateurs ont vite réagi, mais il semblerait que la pratique ait continué à progresser avec de nouveaux records en 2022. Il y a quelques mois, on a même trouvé un mineur de crypto caché <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pirated-final-cut-pro-infects-your-mac-with-cryptomining-malware/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pirated-final-cut-pro-infects-your-mac-with-cryptomining-malware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dans les versions illégales de Final Cut Pro</a> d&rsquo;Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Injection dans les pubs / Malvertising</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus récente, cette technique utilise les espaces publicitaires&nbsp;des sites pour injecter du code malveillant. Pour résumer, il s&rsquo;agit pour les attaquants de compromettre un des serveurs diffusant la publicité et de rediriger le clic sur celle-ci vers leur propre site ou d&rsquo;installer discrètement un logiciel corrompu (type exploit kit ou autres). Dans certains cas cela peut même se faire sans interaction, juste en visitant une page, via la simple exécution d&rsquo;un JavaScript ou de Flash (qui se perd heureusement).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o752lstY4OCun1YVq/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Solution : Surfshark Antivirus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>La solution pour ne plus entendre parler de ces différentes menaces et vous moquer de ceux qui se font encore avoir ?&nbsp;(se moquer c&rsquo;est mal, sachez-le). <strong>De bons comportements sur le web et un&nbsp;bon antivirus</strong> comme celui de Surfshark (dispo pour macOS, Android et Windows). Ce dernier, qui utilise le très bon moteur d&rsquo;Avira,&nbsp;va en effet mettre en place de manière automatisée différentes couches de protection :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>surveillance en temps réel et en continu</li>\n\n\n\n<li>analyses de vos disques durs (manuelles ou programmées à intervalle régulier)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>scan de tous les fichiers que vous téléchargez</li>\n\n\n\n<li>analyse des pièces jointes reçues&nbsp;dans vos&nbsp;mails</li>\n\n\n\n<li>prémunit des attaques Zéro Day (failles connues, mais non encore patchées)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>sécurise la caméra et le&nbsp;micro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bloque les publicités</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Et tout cela de manière intuitive (interface épurée) et surtout légère pour votre machine, pas besoin d&rsquo;avoir une grosse bécane pour le faire tourner. Son autre avantage est bien entendu d&rsquo;être intégré aux autres produits Surfshark, ce qui vous permet de tout gérer à partir de la même interface. En gros, <strong>vous pouvez l&rsquo;oublier et il fera le nécessaire en tâche de fond</strong>. De plus, par rapport à mon premier article sur le sujet, <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Surfshark Antivirus</a> a pris un peu de bouteille.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cerise sur votre glace fondante, Surfshark Antivirus propose en ce moment une <strong>offre promo à -76% sur l&rsquo;abonnement 1 an</strong> ! Vous ne payerez donc que 3.49€ par mois (HT).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Profitez-en !</a></h2>\n",

Ainsi, l&rsquo;équipe de développement d&rsquo;un jeu pourrait travailler à partir de propositions visuelles réalistes fournies par l&rsquo;outil Sky Box, ce qui ouvre un monde de possibilités pour les créateurs de jeux. Même la série à succès <em>The Witcher</em> a eu droit à sa part de concepts générés par l’IA, avec plusieurs lieux imaginés pour une éventuelle suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais ce n&rsquo;est pas tout, car Sky Box est capable d&rsquo;imaginer des collaborations créatives entre différents univers. Par exemple, elle a généré un biome cubique inspiré des îles Skellige pour une éventuelle collaboration entre CD Projekt RED et <em>Minecraft</em>.

Evidemment, les fans inconditionnels ont cherché désespérément depuis à mettre la main sur une borne d&rsquo;arcade du jeu. Mais c&rsquo;est un Graal impossible à atteindre pour le commun des mortels. Mais grâce à ce portage, c&rsquo;est de l&rsquo;histoire ancienne. Plus besoin de vendre votre âme au diable pour mettre la main sur une version borne d&rsquo;arcade tant convoitée !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans ce jeu, les joueurs prennent le rôle de personnages issus de la série et se battent contre des hordes de créatures maléfiques dans des environnements inspirés des Castlevania précédents. Le gameplay est riche et immersif, à tel point qu&rsquo;on en oublierait presque qu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un jeu d&rsquo;arcade et non d&rsquo;un des épisodes majeurs de la série. Jusqu&rsquo;à deux joueurs peuvent jouer simultanément, incitant à la coopération et permettant de partager les frissons de l&rsquo;aventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Castlevania: The Arcade - TUTORIAL - Play it RIGHT NOW on your PC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLMpnAYW3mQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Les personnages du jeu comprennent le chasseur de vampires, la tireuse d&rsquo;élite et la petite sorcière. Chacun d&rsquo;eux présente ses propres compétences et armes ce qui permet d&rsquo;apporter de la fraîcheur à chaque partie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Des créatures bien connues telles que Dracula et la Mort font également partie de ce jeu et apportent une touche nostalgique, rappelant les heures que nous avons passées à affronter ces boss redoutables, et qui sont en soi un clin d&rsquo;œil aux fans de longue date. On notera également la qualité graphique et l&rsquo;ambiance sonore, toujours fidèle à l&rsquo;esprit Castlevania, riche en références à la grande époque de la franchise.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1925583851\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124507\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors si vous souhaitez redécouvrir ce classique oublié ou si vous cherchez à affronter les créatures de la nuit au côté d&rsquo;un ami, je vous conseille vivement de vous pencher sur Castlevania: The Arcade. Le dump de la carte PCB étant désormais disponible, une fois installé, vous aurez enfin la possibilité de jouer sur votre PC, seul ou en coopération. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour ce qui est des optimisations, je dois dire que le jeu tourne remarquablement bien sur PC, et ce même pour des configurations plus modestes. Bien entendu, il ne vous offrira pas une expérience 100% identique à celle de la borne d&rsquo;arcade d&rsquo;origine, notamment en ce qui concerne les contrôleurs spécifiques. Toutefois, ce léger compromis vaut largement la peine si cela signifie pouvoir mettre la main sur ce morceau d&rsquo;histoire vidéoludique et satisfaire vos envies de chasse aux monstres !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En résumé, <em>Castlevania: The Arcade</em> est un trésor à la fois pour les amateurs de la série Castlevania et les fans de jeux d&rsquo;arcade en général. Si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas familier avec la série, c&rsquo;est également une excellente occasion de vous plonger dans cet univers par le biais d&rsquo;un gameplay amusant et coopératif. C&rsquo;est une cette chance de revivre les frissons des jeux d&rsquo;arcades des années 2000, le cul visé dans un fauteuil de games bien confortable ^^.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le temps est venu d&rsquo;affronter les forces du mal et de libérer le monde des griffes de l&rsquo;obscurité. À vos fouets, chasseurs de vampires !

Veillez à ce que la taille de votre image ne dépasse pas 600 x 600 pixels, sinon elle sera redimensionnée automatiquement. Et si vous avez un compte premium, vous bénéficierez d&rsquo;une taille maximale de 1000 x 1000 pixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois votre image téléchargée, il vous suffit de suivre ces 3 étapes pour obtenir un fichier STL à partir de votre fichier JPG ou PNG :</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Définissez les dimensions et les autres options selon vos préférences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cliquez sur le bouton « Convert to STL » pour lancer la conversion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Téléchargez votre fichier STL nouvellement créé.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Le processus de conversion analysera alors chaque pixel de l&rsquo;image en niveaux de gris et attribuera une hauteur en 3D en fonction de la luminosité. Je vous fais une petite analogie simple à comprendre : imaginez que chaque pixel corresponde à un monticule de sable sur une plage. Plus le pixel est lumineux, plus le monticule est élevé.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trois modes sont disponibles lors de la conversion : le mode Standard, le mode Extrude Color, et le mode Extrude. Le mode Extrude Color fonctionne de la même manière que le mode Standard mais intègre également les informations de couleur pour créer un modèle 3D plus réaliste et détaillé.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-656577290\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124507\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, en mode standard, c&rsquo;est tout un concept : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-htce.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152540\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-htce.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-htce-300x136.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-htce-768x347.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Mais en mode Extrude, on peut partir d&rsquo;un simple dessin comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/an-ufo-a-spacecraft-object-illustration-in-uncolored-outline-simple-hand-drawn-drawing-of-a-single-space-object-a-doodle-isolated-on-white-for-outer-space-theme-design-free-vector-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152542\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/an-ufo-a-spacecraft-object-illustration-in-uncolored-outline-simple-hand-drawn-drawing-of-a-single-space-object-a-doodle-isolated-on-white-for-outer-space-theme-design-free-vector-1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/an-ufo-a-spacecraft-object-illustration-in-uncolored-outline-simple-hand-drawn-drawing-of-a-single-space-object-a-doodle-isolated-on-white-for-outer-space-theme-design-free-vector-1-300x191.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/an-ufo-a-spacecraft-object-illustration-in-uncolored-outline-simple-hand-drawn-drawing-of-a-single-space-object-a-doodle-isolated-on-white-for-outer-space-theme-design-free-vector-1-768x490.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et arriver à un vrai objet comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hutr.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152543\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hutr.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hutr-300x135.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hutr-768x346.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pour les amateurs de jeux vidéo et les développeurs d&rsquo;applications 3D, cet outil est une véritable aubaine.

Ensuite, tapez un texte neutre comme point de départ (« face »), puis modifiez le texte cible pour y inclure l&rsquo;édition souhaitée, telle que « face with blue eyes ». Vous verrez alors les résultats aussi étonnants que flippants de l&rsquo;IA à l&rsquo;œuvre, modifiant l&rsquo;image en fonction de vos instructions.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hogr.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152534\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hogr.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hogr-300x195.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230529-hogr-768x499.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, ce n&rsquo;est pas encore parfait mais c&rsquo;est amusant à essayer.

Tout comme <a href=\"https://korben.info/doom-retro-portage-windows.html\">Doom Retro</a>, il est basé sur l&rsquo;excellent Chocolate Doom, dont la réputation n&rsquo;est plus à faire. Pour les fans de rétrogaming comme moi, cela signifie une expérience de jeu améliorée, avec un affichage en top résolution, un rendu en écran large pouvant aller jusqu&rsquo;à 24:9, et certaines limitations du jeu supprimées. Tout cela, bien sûr, sans entacher la compatibilité originale avec Vanilla Doom et Chocolate Doom.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-318380252\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124505\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_1' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_1\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos1' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos1\"></div></div><p>Admirez ce passage en écran large : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/widescreen.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152500\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Parmi les nombreuses fonctionnalités de Crispy Doom, certaines retiennent particulièrement l&rsquo;attention. La liberté de mouvement notamment au niveau de l&rsquo;angle de vue offre une perspective de jeu beaucoup plus immersive. L&rsquo;ajout de <a href=\"http://www.gameart.eu/publi/dossiers/lexique/reticule-de-visee.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">réticules</a> pour faciliter la visée est également une amélioration bienvenue : après tout, quoi de plus naturel, quand on n&rsquo;est pas chasseur, que de savoir exactement où l&rsquo;on tire ^^ ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Côté interface, je suis ravi de découvrir un HUD minimaliste (HUD, ça veut dire affichage tête haute), qui n&rsquo;encombre pas l&rsquo;écran d&rsquo;infos inutiles. Pour ne rien gâcher, une fonctionnalité de capture d&rsquo;écran vraiment clean a été ajoutée, permettant de capturer nos exploits sans les encombrer avec les éléments de l&rsquo;interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bien sûr, une longue liste d&rsquo;autres améliorations sont également de la partie, comme les chiffres de la barre d&rsquo;état qui ont été colorisés, la possibilité de marcher sur ou sous des monstres et des cadavres suspendus (brrr), ou encore l&rsquo;inclinaison des armes lors du tir pour encore plus de réalisme.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-190116022\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124507\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Je vous invite à consulter la liste complète des fonctionnalités <a href=\"https://crispy-doom.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ici</a>, mais l&rsquo;un des atouts majeurs de Crispy Doom, selon moi, est sa capacité à offrir toutes ces améliorations sous la forme d&rsquo;options que vous êtes libres d&rsquo;activer ou non via le menu « Crispness », en ligne de commande ou grâce à l&rsquo;outil <em>crispy-doom-setup</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/menu.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152501\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Crispy Doom prend également en charge les fichiers DEHACKED et au format BEX, ce qui élargit considérablement les possibilités de customisation du jeu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez télécharger Crispy Doom pour Windows, MacOS ou Linux depuis la <a href=\"https://crispy-doom.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">page de téléchargement officielle</a>. Les fondus de nouveautés pourront également se tourner vers les versions nightly du soft pour avoir les dernières options et corrections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Là où Crispy Doom assure graaaave, c&rsquo;est dans sa documentation bien détaillée et bien bien complète. Impossible de se sentir perdu, avec des explications claires sur les codes de triche, les contrôles, ou encore les paramètres à utiliser en ligne de commande. Notez qu&rsquo;à part Doom, il existe également des portages pour d&rsquo;autres jeux comme Crispy Heretic, Crispy Hexen and Crispy Strife pour ceux qui veulent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour finir, je tiens à saluer le travail de Fabian Greffrath, qui maintient le projet Crispy Doom. Sans lui, cette version améliorée du jeu culte n&rsquo;aurait pas vu le jour. Si vous avez des bugs ou des problèmes à signaler, vous pourrez le faire via l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom/issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Issue Tracker</a> de GitHub. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prêts à replonger dans les méandres de Doom ? </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1930725044\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124508\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p><a href=\"https://crispy-doom.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">C&rsquo;est à découvrir par ici</a>.</p>\n",

Aujourd&rsquo;hui, je partage avec vous cette bibliothèque de reconnaissance faciale vraiment top : <a href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">face_recognition</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette lib repose sur la pointe de la technologie en matière de reconnaissance faciale, notamment grâce à <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://dlib.net/\" target=\"_blank\">dlib</a>. D&rsquo;ailleurs, elle revendique une précision impressionnante de 99,38 % au benchmark <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/\" target=\"_blank\">Labeled Faces in the Wild</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La bibliothèque face_recognition offre une panoplie de fonctionnalités : Elle détecte les faces sur les photos, repère les traits du visage (yeux, nez, bouche et menton) et reconnaît les personnes. Vous pouvez même combiner cette bibliothèque avec d&rsquo;autres libs Python pour effectuer une reconnaissance faciale en temps réel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour l&rsquo;installer, assurez-vous d&rsquo;avoir Python 3.3+ ou Python 2.7, ainsi que macOS ou Linux. Ensuite, un simple </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pip3 install face_recognition</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-889917746\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124507\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>&#8230; fera l&rsquo;affaire ! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>La bibliothèque est également compatible avec <a href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#deployment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Docker</a>, et, si vous rencontrez des problèmes d&rsquo;installation, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">une machine virtuelle préconfigurée</a> est à votre disposition. De plus, des instructions d&rsquo;installation pour Windows, Rasberry Pi et FreeBSD sont également dispo sur la page Github.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La bibliothèque face_recognition contient deux programmes en ligne de commande : <code>face_recognition</code> et <code>face_detection</code>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le premier programme reconnaît les visages dans une ou plusieurs photos, tandis que le second trouve les positions des visages dans les images. Petite astuce, si vous obtenez plusieurs correspondances pour une même personne, essayez d&rsquo;ajuster l&rsquo;option <code>--tolerance</code> pour obtenir des résultats plus précis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrjs.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152481\" width=\"482\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrjs.webp 865w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrjs-300x260.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrjs-768x666.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrky.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152482\" width=\"475\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrky.webp 869w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrky-300x259.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-jrky-768x663.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pour essayer le modèle de détection de visage basé sur l&rsquo;apprentissage en profondeur, je vous invite à implémenter <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py\" target=\"_blank\">ce code</a>.

Comme d&rsquo;habitude, PyInstaller est votre meilleur ami ! Cependant, une configuration personnalisée sera nécessaire pour fonctionner correctement avec cette bibliothèque.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il est bon de noter que cette technologie présente certaines limitations. Par exemple, la reconnaissance faciale fonctionne moins bien sur les enfants et peut varier entre les groupes ethniques. Pour plus de détails, vous pouvez consulter la <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Face-Recognition-Accuracy-Problems#question-face-recognition-works-well-with-european-individuals-but-overall-accuracy-is-lower-with-asian-individuals\" target=\"_blank\">page wiki</a> qui vous expliquera tout à ce sujet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En somme, face_recognition est une bibliothèque open-source vraiment chouette permettant le développement de projets de reconnaissance faciale en Python. C&rsquo;est une bonne opportunité pour vous lancer dans la création d&rsquo;applications IA de reconnaissance faciale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition\" target=\"_blank\">À découvrir ici</a></p>\n",

C&rsquo;est un outil hyper pratique qui s&rsquo;appelle <strong>Reggy</strong>. Reggy c&rsquo;est notre super-héros qui vient à notre rescousse pour créer en 1 seconde, des identités totalement aléatoires et nous permettre de nous inscrire rapidement sur n&rsquo;importe quel site sans dévoiler notre identité réelle ! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà comment fonctionne cette merveille : une fois l&rsquo;extension installée sur Google Chrome, celle-ci propose un « remplisseur » de formulaire intégré. Ainsi, plus besoin de perdre du temps à chercher des informations à entrer dans les champs obligatoires des formulaires. Reggy les génère rapidement pour vous, tout en gardant le tout cohérent et crédible. À l&rsquo;aide de cette extension, vous pourrez alors vous inscrire sur n&rsquo;importe quel site en quelques secondes et sans avoir à réfléchir à deux fois. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gxmq.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152470\" width=\"386\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gxmq.webp 650w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gxmq-260x300.webp 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai été scotché par la façon dont Reggy génère les identités. Les noms et les informations semblent vraiment réels. Un autre point fort de cet outil est que, en plus des identités aléatoires pour le formulaire d&rsquo;inscription, il peut également générer des adresses email temporaires pour vous protéger contre les messages indésirables. Comme ça, si vous souhaitez essayer de nouveaux services sans pour autant inonder votre boîte de mails publicitaires, cet outil est fait pour vous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et voilà ! En quelques clics, Reggy vous aura permis de vous inscrire sur n&rsquo;importe quel site, en vous faisant gagner du temps et évitant de partager des informations personnelles inutiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1418877749\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124507\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas que l&rsquo;utilisation de Reggy ne doit pas être utilisée à des fins illégales ou pour contourner des restrictions importantes, comme ouvrir un compte sur une banque en ligne ou sur des services gouvernementaux qui exigent une vérification d&rsquo;identité. Prison direct sinon !! L&rsquo;outil est surtout destiné à simplifier le processus d&rsquo;inscription sur les sites et à protéger votre vie privée lorsque cela est possible et bien sûr légal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reggy/pnneajlgffpejnabhionnhdfhibijihe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici</a></strong> !</p>\n",

Cette extension Chrome a été développée avec un objectif simple en tête: aider les utilisateurs à naviguer sur le web en toute confidentialité en leur permettant de modifier les données perso renvoyées par le navigateur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gjxq-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152459\" width=\"260\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gjxq-2.webp 581w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gjxq-2-232x300.webp 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vytal vous permet ainsi de modifier et personnaliser un certain nombre de paramètres pour apparaître comme si vous accédiez à Internet depuis un emplacement, une région, ou un appareil différent. Vous pouvez ainsi changer votre fuseau horaire, votre localisation, votre géolocalisation, et votre user agent.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1045126709\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124507\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Avec Vytal, vous pouvez choisir de vous faire passer pour un utilisateur se trouvant dans un autre pays, voire sur un autre continent, mais attention, il ne modifiera pas votre IP, donc c&rsquo;est complémentaire d&rsquo;un bon vieux VPN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous vous demandez peut-être comment Vytal parvient à tromper les sites web que vous visitez ?  Et bien, la réponse réside dans l&rsquo;API chrome.debugger que Vytal utilise pour modifier les données de votre navigateur. Cela permet à l&rsquo;extension de fonctionner de manière totalement indétectable.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gjuo.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152461\" width=\"279\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gjuo.webp 587w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/05/SCR-20230524-gjuo-235x300.webp 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comparée à d&rsquo;autres extensions du marché, Vytal se distingue par sa facilité d&rsquo;utilisation et sa transparence. Pas de collecte de données en arrière-plan, pas de publicité intrusive. Tout est fait pour vous offrir l&rsquo;expérience de navigation la plus sécurisée et anonyme possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vytal fonctionne également très bien avec d&rsquo;autres extensions de confidentialité et de sécurité telles que <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stealthy/ieaebnkibonmpbhdaanjkmedikadnoje?hl=fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stealthy</a>, <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lockpw/kjcloihghgncbdkaafgkckbokjnehfmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LockPW</a> et <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-control/fjkmabmdepjfammlpliljpnbhleegehm?hl=fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WebRTC Control</a>. Il est donc conseillé de les utiliser ensemble pour renforcer votre anonymat en ligne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour terminer, je tiens à mentionner que Vytal est entièrement gratuit. Les développeurs travaillent dur pour fournir un outil de qualité à la communauté, sans chercher à monétiser leurs efforts. Si vous êtes convaincu par le potentiel de cette extension et souhaitez les remercier, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à leur faire un petit don ou à contribuer au projet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour ma découverte du jour. Je vous recommande vivement de tester Vytal. Qui sait, vous pourriez trouver cet outil indispensable pour préserver votre vie privée en ligne ?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-254727568\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackid=\"124508\" data-NKSYD1CP-trackbid=\"1\" class=\"NKSYD1CP-target\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p><a href=\"https://vytal.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici</a></p>\n",

Donc normalement, plus de chiens qui se baladent partout dans mon jardin en mode portenawak ni de boucan de bagnoles, coups de feu, mecs qui braillent tout le weekend comme si j&rsquo;habitais en centre-ville de Marseille. Enfin, jusqu&rsquo;à la prochaine fois&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aussi ce week-end, je me suis habillé en stabilo orange (sécurité oblige) pour débiter un nouvel arbre qui était tombé à cause du vent. Y&rsquo;a plus qu&rsquo;à laisser sécher ce futur bois de chauffage pendant quelques années. Vive la tronçonneuse ! Et oui j&rsquo;ai mal partout, mais j&rsquo;ai conservé mes 2 jambes. Ces activités en plein air, c&rsquo;est mieux que Basic Fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avec la fin des vacances de février, c&rsquo;est aussi un grand plaisir de retrouver tout le monde, que ce soit sur <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenFR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch</a> ou <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@korbeninfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok</a>. C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;occasion de reprendre nos échanges passionnés ;-).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai également commencé une série que je trouve très cool : The Orville. Même si elle n&rsquo;est pas récente, elle est très fun. C&rsquo;est un genre de Star Trek en rigolo. Ça permet de se détendre après une grosse journée. Je vous la conseille.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour les news. Et surtout, n&rsquo;oubliez pas de vous accrocher à vos projets et de continuer à apprendre chaque jour. J&rsquo;espère d&rsquo;ailleurs que j&rsquo;y contribue un peu. La clé du succès est la persévérance donc ne lâchez rien !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À bientôt !</p>\n",

Le plus souvent à votre insu. Je vous ai aussi fait <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-cnil.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-cnil.html\">un petit article</a> sur les lois qu&rsquo;ils sont censés respecter. Mais ce que je n&rsquo;ai pas encore abordé c&rsquo;est <strong>la manière dont cela peut vous porter directement préjudice</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, savoir que nos infos (parfois privées) se promènent un peu partout n&rsquo;est déjà pas très fun en soit. Mais réaliser qu&rsquo;il y a en plus un risque qu&rsquo;elles se retournent contre nous pour impacter négativement notre vie, c&rsquo;est encore un autre stade. Et Incogni vient à nouveau vous prêter main-forte.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/vP5tCg09mctxuPwY1C/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez lu mes articles précédents vous connaissez le principe de base : <strong>les data brokers récupèrent des tonnes d&rsquo;informations</strong> depuis de nombreuses sources (base de données revendues/hackées, profils sociaux, données publiques,&nbsp;cookies publicitaires&nbsp;&#8230;). Ils croisent alors ces différentes&nbsp;datas&nbsp;afin de&nbsp;créer&nbsp;un profil numérique le plus complet possible pour chaque internaute et les classer dans différentes catégories d&rsquo;audience (joueurs de console PlayStation, ménagère dont le hobby est la cuisine, grand sportif &#8230;). Je parie qu&rsquo;ils ont même créé une catégorie rien que pour moi : chef d&rsquo;Internet éleveur de poules ou débroussailleur poseur&nbsp;placo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et quand je parle de « chaque internaute » je ne pense pas être trop&nbsp;loin de la réalité. Vous avez un compte Amazon ? À moins d&rsquo;interdire les cookies, vos infos sont revendues à plusieurs dizaines de boites. En 2022 la CNIL a généré pour plus de 100 millions d&rsquo;amendes autour du <strong>mauvais respect de la protection des&nbsp;données personnelles des Français</strong>. Et « tout le monde » y est passé : Microsoft, Apple, Facebook (quelle surprise!)&nbsp;&#8230; même EDF&nbsp;et plus récemment l&rsquo;éditeur de jeux mobiles&nbsp;Voodoo (Helix Jump, Paper.io &#8230;).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"650\" height=\"200\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/cyt-incogni-risques-databrokers\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sauf que, en plus de ne pas respecter&nbsp;notre intimité, le profil qui est&nbsp;créé&nbsp;n&rsquo;est pas forcément toujours précis ni d&rsquo;actualité. Il peut y avoir des zones d&rsquo;ombres, des données périmées,&nbsp;un flou en fonction de la véracité même des infos que vous renseignez, des outils et services que vous utilisez au quotidien, du nombre de profils que vous utilisez, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or cela peut poser problème lorsque l&rsquo;organisme qui achète vos infos est une banque, une assurance ou encore une entreprise qui recrute.&nbsp;Et que ces derniers prennent une décision basée sur un profil qui ne représente plus&nbsp;votre situation actuelle. Aux USA, il y a déjà quelques années, un homme s&rsquo;est ainsi vu refuser un boulot à cause de données erronées récoltées par son potentiel employeur. Il a par la suite <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/smith-v-lexisnexis-screening-solutions-inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://casetext.com/case/smith-v-lexisnexis-screening-solutions-inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gagné un procès</a> contre le courtier ayant revendu ses infos, car il n&rsquo;a pas été possible de prouver à 100% que tout le concernait. L&rsquo;avantage de porter un nom assez bateau comme David Smith 😉</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/WOrD6XwdYtkr2DZ0U7/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Exemple de famille Smith en train de brouiller les pistes</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous voyez que, sur un malentendu,&nbsp;cela peut mal tourner.&nbsp;La meilleure protection à ce niveau&nbsp;reste de supprimer ses traces le plus tôt possible :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>ne pas créer un compte si ce n&rsquo;est pas nécessaire</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ne pas donner plus d&rsquo;infos que le minimum requit pour faire fonctionner le service demandé</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utiliser des outils et services adaptés (navigateur axé vie privée, messagerie chiffrée &#8230;)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>faire supprimer les données déjà stockées chez les data brokers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour ce dernier point, vous pouvez vous tourner les yeux fermés&nbsp;<a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">vers Incogni</a>. Le service de Surfshark sera d&rsquo;une aide précieuse pour faire disparaitre les informations qui sont déjà présentes dans les listes des courtiers.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Déjà, le service vous permet de définir votre propre niveau de granularité (chaque fois que j&rsquo;écris ce mot je pense aux granulés de bois pour pellet, c&rsquo;est grave docteur ?). Quelles sont les informations que vous voulez laisser&nbsp;visibles et quelles sont celles que vous voulez faire&nbsp;supprimer ? Une fois que vous avez fait vos choix, Incogni va alors contacter les data brokers au cas par cas&nbsp;afin de leur rappeler vos droits et demander&nbsp;les suppressions nécessaires dans les bases de données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si les brokers esquivent la demande ? Incogni va les relancer encore et encore, jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ça finisse pas passer. Une fois que c&rsquo;est fait, l&rsquo;outil continue à surveiller du coin de l&rsquo;oeil que le broker ne vous remet pas dans sa base. Bref il y a un vrai suivi et, en plus de protéger votre vie privée, cela va vous faire&nbsp;économiser des heures de travail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Découvrir le service Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Ce nouveau Pokémon suit les traces de pattes de  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EFd1sQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Légendes Pokémon Arceus</a> et propose des environnements ouverts, à explorer à notre guise. Dès le départ (enfin, après une séquence de didacticiel qui met en place l’histoire), on peut choisir par quel côté débuter notre expédition, par définir quel objectif atteindre en priorité, etc. C&rsquo;est aussi rafraîchissant qu’un verre de lait meumeu !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et malgré cette réelle liberté, la progression est plutôt bien dosée. On débloque régulièrement des pouvoirs pour notre monture, ce qui nous permet d’atteindre de nouvelles zones. Le niveau des Pokémons rencontrés correspond plutôt bien à notre niveau à nous (et quand ce n’est pas le cas ce n’est pas trop gênant), là dessus, c’est bien foutu. Le scénario sort un peu du schéma habituel et on prend plaisir à avancer à son rythme.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Z3Q2jj\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-2-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132851\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-2.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2) L&rsquo;école forbuissonnière</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Au centre de la map : l&rsquo;Académie. Ce n’est pas précisé clairement au départ, mais je vous conseille de vous y rendre régulièrement entre deux “missions”, car il y a des leçons à débloquer, ça nous apprend pas mal de subtilités sur le <em>gameplay </em>ou l’univers du jeu : y a des mini-quêtes, on va tisser des liens avec les profs et quelques élèves, et ça structure un peu notre progression. Et puis ça permet de récupérer plein de récompenses facilement. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-379253135\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Ces allers-retours ne sont pas agaçants, car dès le départ de l’aventure, on a accès au déplacement rapide (concrètement : téléportation) et la carte nous indique les points intéressants de manière claire. Si l’envie vous prend de chasser les créatures téracristalisées, ou de retourner découvrir une zone précise, c’est faisable !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Z3Q2jj\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132852\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-3.webp 720w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-3-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>3) Des combats pas barbants</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je m’explique. 😀 Le système de baston a toujours été sympa, mais parfois un peu fastidieux (écrans de transitions et textes un peu longs, combats aléatoires&#8230;). Dans <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EFd1sQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arceus</a>, tout cela avait été un peu bouleversé (aucun écran de transition, attaques rapides ou puissantes, Pokémon barons&#8230;), et c’était cool. Mais ici ils sont revenus en arrière sur pas mal de points. :’( Heureusement ils ont gardé certains trucs, et ajouté plein de petits détails qui nous facilitent la vie et rendent l’expérience plus fluide et agréable que dans les autres jeux canoniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capturer un Pokémon demande toujours d’entrer en combat, cependant, se cacher dans les hautes herbes et lui balancer une pokéball par surprise (dans le dos) facilitera grandement l’opération. Manger certains aliments (on peut cuisiner et faire des piques-niques) boostera nos compétences de capture ou autre. Il est possible d’avoir un Pokémon de compagnie qui se balade à nos côtés : il ira se battre automatiquement, engrangeant XP et objets sans intervention de notre part ou presque. Ça nous évite plein de combats superflus, rend l’exploration et le <em>farming </em>plus agréable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Z3Q2jj\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-4-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132853\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-4-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-4-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-4-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-4.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>4) Une interface qui QoL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus besoin d’aller voir un NPC précis planqué dans un recoin paumé, pour effectuer certaines action bien précises : les menus sont complets, et nous permettent ENFIN de quasiment tout faire quand on le souhaite (même d’apprendre d’anciennes techniques, de renommer les Pokémons, &#8230;). <strong>OUF</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aussi, pour une fois, on a un “vrai” mode multijoueur. On peut se retrouver jusqu’à 4 joueurs dans la même instance, explorer, échanger, faire des photos (🤷), participer à des raids ensemble, etc. L&rsquo;avancée dans le scénario reste indépendante, car le jeu conserve la progression de chaque joueur, mais il est possible de faire nos quêtes chacun de son côté tout en étant dans le même monde, se retrouver sur la map, faire des échanges, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Z3Q2jj\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-5-1024x723.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132854\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-5-1024x723.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-5-300x212.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-5-768x543.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-5.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>5) Violet, écarlate, tout n’est pas rose</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>J’apprécie beaucoup ce volet, mais je regrette certains points. Tout d’abord, l’aspect graphique : c’est assez vide, fade, et parfois ça rame&#8230; 🙁 Un comble quand on voit certains jeux comme les <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IZARCu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xenoblade</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Y9Rb7M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zelda</a>, ou <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KGRFPV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon Quest XI</a>, beaucoup plus jolis et fluides sur la même console !</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-132844566\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Aussi, je trouve dommage que le système de chasse/capture, tel qu&rsquo;il était implémenté dans <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3EFd1sQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arceus</a>, ne soit pas de retour. Pareil pour les “barons”, les Pokémon de différentes tailles, etc. C’était vachement fun et ça apportait de la variété au gameplay.&nbsp; Peut-être que la prochaine génération osera faire le mélange de tout ça ?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Z3Q2jj\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-6-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132855\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-6-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-6-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-6-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/02/pokemon-ecarlate-violet-6.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>En dehors de ces quelques regrets, je trouve que c’est un excellent jeu, qui renouvelle l’expérience de belle manière. La durée de vie est plus que correcte, le scénario promet quelques surprises et l&rsquo;aspect collectionnite est toujours aussi réussi. Ça apporte un bon petit coup de frais à la licence, vraiment agréable, je conseille !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Z3Q2jj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acheter Pokémon Violet</a> ou <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xUmzwD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Écarlate sur Nintendo Switch</a></h2>\n",

C&rsquo;est assez génial comme idée et je vais tout vous expliquer dans cet article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous le savez, en ce moment, niveau production électrique en France, ce n’est pas la joie. Il y a chaque jour des pics de consommation naturels parce que les gens rentrent chez eux le soir et allument le chauffage tous en même temps. Pour pallier à ça, en France, on a redémarré des usines de production d&rsquo;électricité assez polluantes (charbon par exemple) et le gouvernement a même annoncé des coupures d&rsquo;électricité. Pas cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et le discours général est : « <em>Que tout le monde fasse des efforts !</em>« .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À titre personnel, je veux bien faire des efforts, mais je ne vois pas trop ce que je peux faire de plus. Il fait entre 14° et 17° dans la maison et quand je chauffe à mort toute la journée (au bois), c&rsquo;est la canicule avec un petit 19°. Donc bon, que faire ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et bien l&rsquo;application <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://me.korben.info/9wu-survoltage\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Survoltage</strong></a> est peut-être une bonne solution pour tous ceux qui veulent à la fois faire des économies sur leur facture, et participer aux efforts communs demandés à tous les Français. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée est simple : <strong>décaler notre consommation d&rsquo;électricité lors des pics.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je participe régulièrement à Survoltage depuis quelques semaines donc je peux vous en parler sereinement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1049\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/gwf-survoltage-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Une fois téléchargée sur l&rsquo;Apple Store ou l&rsquo;Android Play Store, l&rsquo;application vous demande de vous créer un compte et de lier votre compteur Linky avec leur service. C&rsquo;est normal puisqu&rsquo;ils ont besoin de la donnée précise pour estimer votre « non-consommation ». </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/9wu-survoltage\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230131-h8f-2-1024x270.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132543\" width=\"552\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230131-h8f-2-1024x270.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230131-h8f-2-300x79.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230131-h8f-2-768x202.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230131-h8f-2-1536x405.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230131-h8f-2.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, quand vient le moment, l&rsquo;app m&rsquo;avertit lorsqu&rsquo;un « effacement » est programmé. En général c&rsquo;est de 19h à 19h30, voire 20h. Les week-ends, c&rsquo;est plutôt le matin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;indique sur l&rsquo;application que je souhaite participer à cet effacement et quand vient l&rsquo;heure, je coupe ou je ne lance pas certains appareils électriques : Radiateurs, four, lave-vaisselle&#8230;etc. Et lorsque c&rsquo;est fini, je rallume à nouveau mes appareils électriques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En faisant ça, je décale ma consommation électrique et cela présente plusieurs avantages. Tout d&rsquo;abord, je participe à l&rsquo;effort commun lors des pics de consommation électrique. Bruno Lemaire est fier de moi ^^ ! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, j&rsquo;économise de l&rsquo;argent puisque pendant 1h, mon chauffage n&rsquo;a pas tourné (et rassurez-vous, ça ne change pas grand-chose niveau confort puisqu&rsquo;il y a quand même une certaine inertie dans la maison).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__gallery\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\" style=\"flex-basis:50.05919%\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-1-507x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=600&#038;ssl=1 600w,https://i2.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-1-507x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=900&#038;ssl=1 900w,https://i2.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-1-507x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=1200&#038;ssl=1 1200w,https://i2.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-1-507x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=1267&#038;ssl=1 1267w\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"2560\" data-id=\"132540\" data-link=\"https://korben.info/?attachment_id=132540\" data-url=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-1-507x1024.webp\" data-width=\"1267\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-1-507x1024.webp?ssl=1\" data-amp-layout=\"responsive\"/></figure></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\" style=\"flex-basis:49.94081%\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-2-506x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=600&#038;ssl=1 600w,https://i0.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-2-506x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=900&#038;ssl=1 900w,https://i0.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-2-506x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=1200&#038;ssl=1 1200w,https://i0.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-2-506x1024.webp?strip=info&#038;w=1264&#038;ssl=1 1264w\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"2560\" data-id=\"132541\" data-link=\"https://korben.info/?attachment_id=132541\" data-url=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-2-506x1024.webp\" data-width=\"1264\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/visuel-telephone-2-506x1024.webp?ssl=1\" data-amp-layout=\"responsive\"/></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, il faut savoir qu&rsquo;une énergie décalée, c&rsquo;est une énergie qui ensuite n&rsquo;est pas à 100% reconsommée donc ça fait encore des économies de ce point de vue là.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour nous récompenser de ce qu&rsquo;on n&rsquo;a pas consommé, Survoltage nous offre des points qui seront plus tard échangeables contre des euros ou des dons (ils attendent une certification pour ça). Donc on y gagne sur tous les tableaux pour un peu qu&rsquo;on joue le jeu de couper le jus aux bons moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certains se contentent de baisser le chauffage ou de lancer un lave-linge un peu plus tard, alors que d&rsquo;autres utilisateurs coupent carrément le disjoncteur et partent faire un tour pendant 1h. Ensuite, ce que vous n&rsquo;avez pas consommé est comptabilisé dans l&rsquo;application et vous pouvez voir ce que vous avez économisé + les points E-Watts gagnés + la quantité de CO2 économisés ce qui fait de vous les premiers écologistes de France et viendra au fil du temps compenser un peu l&#8217;empreinte carbone de votre iPhone dernier cri 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je vous rassure, rien n&rsquo;est obligatoire. Si certains jours, vous ne pouvez pas réduire votre consommation ou que vous zappez, pas de soucis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voila c&rsquo;est comme ça que fonctionnent les opérateurs d&rsquo;effacement. Ils aident le réseau électrique à effacer la crête des pics de consommation. Les marchés européens leur paye l&rsquo;électricité non consommée au même tarif qu&rsquo;une électricité consommée et Survoltage en reverse environ 60%. D&rsquo;après Survoltage, en jouant le jeu tous les jours, vous pouvez gagner jusqu&rsquo;à 15% d&rsquo;économie sur votre facture à l&rsquo;année en plus des points EWATT gagnés.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un truc intéressant avec Survoltage, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez également automatiser la coupure de vos appareils avec votre domotique et un compte IFTTT (ça utilise des webhooks). Idéal pour les têtes en l&rsquo;air !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et bien sûr l&rsquo;application est totalement gratuite. Le mieux c&rsquo;est donc de l&rsquo;installer et de tester le concept pour voir si ça convient avec votre rythme. En tout cas, il y a un petit côté addictif de voir les points s&rsquo;accumuler ainsi que les économies de CO2 et même mes enfants sont fans de jouer au jeu « Survoltage » le soir.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/9wu-survoltage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TÉLÉCHARGER SURVOLTAGE</a></h2>\n",

Ce programme qui peut tourner sous Windows, macOS et Linux a juste besoin lors de sa compilation de la ROM d&rsquo;origine dans sa première version US du jeu pour en extraire les ressources (les niveaux, les images, les musiques) qui sont évidemment encore copyrightées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-k3z.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132389\" width=\"496\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-k3z.webp 832w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-k3z-300x277.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-k3z-768x709.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Mais une fois que c&rsquo;est fait, il y a plus qu&rsquo;à lancer le binaire et vous pourrez jouer nativement au jeu Zelda &#8211; Link To The Past.

Pour info, je vous ai également mis un code promo à la fin de l&rsquo;article qui permet d&rsquo;obtenir 200 euros de réduction sur l&rsquo;appareil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XGIMI est une marque qui a été lancé en 2013 et qui travaille pas mal de partenaires comme Google, Harman Kardon ou encore Texas Instruments.

Ce projecteur dispose d&rsquo;un moteur optique 4K, d&rsquo;une résolution de 3840 x 2160, soit 8,29 millions de pixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/a89-xgimitrk\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Autant dire que les films sont encore plus sympa qu&rsquo;avant même si j&rsquo;ai découvert à cette occasion que Netflix voulait m&rsquo;escroquer un forfait supérieur pour de la 4K. Non merci :-).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Habituellement, regarder un film sur un projo quand il fait jour dehors, c&rsquo;est moyen. Mais avec sa luminosité de 2200 ANSI lumens, c&rsquo;est parfaitement faisable et tout aussi agréable qu&rsquo;en soirée. D&rsquo;ailleurs si vous vous demandez à quelle taille d&rsquo;écran le HORIZON Pro correspond avec sa résolution, c&rsquo;est comme si vous aviez une TV de 200 pouces de diagonales (soit 4,42 mètres sur 2,52 mètres). Gigantesque non ?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132383\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl-300x114.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl-768x292.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, j&rsquo;ai été impressionné par la qualité de l&rsquo;image. J&rsquo;ai fait quelques tests avec des vidéos 4K le HDR-10 (pour un max de contrastes) et X-VUE 2.0 qui permet d&rsquo;avoir une qualité de fou en terme de rendu d&rsquo;image, avec des couleurs vives, des noirs profond et même une réduction du « bruit » présent sur l&rsquo;image (+ de clarté quoi).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132510\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-1024x768.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-768x576.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>La techno MEMC, que je ne connaissais pas avant, vient également améliorer la fluidité de l&rsquo;image, réduisant la latence, faisant disparaitre les images fantômes et compensant la perte de détail sur l&rsquo;image. C&rsquo;est très sympa surtout pour les amateurs de films d&rsquo;action ou les gamers qui voient ainsi leur expérience visuelle grandement améliorée (on évite la nausée).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et même si j&rsquo;ai déjà des lunettes qui filtrent la lumière bleue, et bien sachez que ce projecteur protégera vos petits yeux grâce à sa réduction native de la lumière bleue.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132516\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-1024x768.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-768x576.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Il s&rsquo;adapte à toutes les surfaces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et surtout, au niveau des fonctionnalités de réglage, je me suis régalé. Avant je devais jouer avec les molettes pour régler la netteté de l&rsquo;image, mais avec ce nouveau projecteur, c&rsquo;est un autre délire. Comme il est équipé de la technologie d&rsquo;Adaptation Intelligente de l&rsquo;Ecran (ISA), il est capable de proposer une mise au pointe entièrement automatique ainsi qu&rsquo;une correction de la distorsion trapézoïdale (si votre projo n&rsquo;est pas pile poile en face de votre mur ou que votre mur n&rsquo;est pas droit). Il dispose même d&rsquo;un mode de contournement intelligent des obstacles, ce qui permet de régler l&rsquo;affichage pour qu&rsquo;il esquive un tableau sur le mur ou une plante verte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici une démo où il esquive le fond vert et fait la mise au point tout seul. Puis je règle l&rsquo;angle de la projection avec la télécommande.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/output.webm\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour la hauteur d&rsquo;affichage, pas de pied réglable par contre. Donc il faudra vous procurer un trépied réglable, un support ou tout simplement un meuble à la bonne hauteur. Moi j&rsquo;ai juste calé un petit bouquin en dessous pour lui donner la bonne inclinaison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, ce que je peux vous dire qu&rsquo;il est très silencieux. C&rsquo;est pas une soufflerie comme d&rsquo;autres vidéo projecteur de qualité moindre. Et il embarque un système audio Harman Kardon, soit 2 haut-parleurs large bande actifs de 8 W chacun, développés spécifiquement pour lui. Du coup, j&rsquo;ai pas besoin de brancher d&rsquo;enceintes ou de mettre un casque pour avoir un son de qualité cinéma DTS-HD et DTS Studio Sound, compatible Dolby Digital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Et le logiciel ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Au niveau du soft, c&rsquo;est de l&rsquo;Android TV avec bien sûr Google Play pour pouvoir installer toutes les applications que vous voulez (Molotov, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney Plus mais également des jeux ou des applications comme Spotify&#8230;etc). Comme Android TV embarque un système de commande vocale « OK Google », vous pouvez même piloter le projecteur à la voix. Et si ce n&rsquo;est pas votre truc, il y a bien sûr une télécommande en plastique et métal avec une bonne prise en main (elle est suffisamment lourde pour ne pas faire toc) et est vraiment très agréable à utiliser.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132378\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Et évidemment pour les gamers, le projecteur dispose d&rsquo;un mode « jeu » avec une latence basse de 35ms et également d&rsquo;un mode « 3D » pour ceux qui veulent se repasser Avatar avec les lunettes. Enfin, en matière de connectivité, il y a tout ce qu&rsquo;il faut à savoir un port DC, 2 ports USB, 2 HDMI, 1 port ethernet, 1 connecteur audio, un connecteur optique, le Bluetooth 5.0 et évidemment, il se connecte en Wifi à votre routeur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si ça vous intéresse, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à vous renseigner davantage sur les fonctionnalités et les « spécificités » techniques pour vous faire une idée de tout ce que ce projecteur peut vous offrir.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>200 € de réduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Il est dispo au prix de 1 699 euros sur le site de XGIMI ou sur Amazon et <strong>avec le code promo </strong>« <strong>Korben</strong>« <strong>, vous pouvez économiser 200 euros et obtenir ce projecteur pour 1499 euros</strong> directement sur la page</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/xgimilink\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://me.korben.info/xgimilink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HORIZON PRO de XGIMI</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Offre valable jusqu&rsquo;au 6 février.</p>\n",

Pour générer une nouvelle clé de chiffrement, vous pouvez procéder comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>age-keygen -o key.txt</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Celle-ci sera stockée dans key.txt. Ensuite, vous pourrez l&rsquo;utiliser pour chiffrer un fichier comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>age --encrypt -i key.txt -o fichier.age fichier.txt</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou directement avec la clé avec le paramètre -r .

La plupart des gens sont dans le superficiel, ce qui est normal puisque tout le monde se méfie de tout le monde, et personne n&rsquo;a le temps d&rsquo;approfondir les échanges. C&rsquo;est triste.

Cette application remet au goût du jour le concept de « correspondants » en connectant des gens du monde entier en fonction de leurs centres d&rsquo;intérêts et d&rsquo;autres critères.

Et c&rsquo;est totalement anonyme&#8230; Vous n&rsquo;avez besoin que d&rsquo;un pseudo pour commencer à vous trouver des amis avec qui échanger.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1292454732\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Les témoignages sur le site sont vraiment sympas&#8230; Ça a sorti certaines personnes de la dépression, d&rsquo;autres ont trouvé l&rsquo;amour, ou un ami, d&rsquo;autres ont monté des projets avec leur correspondant.

Slowly permet de toucher cela du doigt, sans pression, sans mettre quoi que ce soit dans la balance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simplement une discussion qui peut durer quelques jours ou se transformer en amitié de toute une vie.

Évidemment déjà à l&rsquo;époque, je m&rsquo;intéressais beaucoup à la cybersécurité, mais à ma connaissance, il n&rsquo;y avait aucune école spécialisée sur ce sujet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heureusement, ça a bien changé, car maintenant, les passionnés de cybersécurité ont l&#8217;embarras du choix au niveau des écoles qui forment à des métiers « cyber ».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant, la cybersécurité est partout dans notre vie quotidienne et les menaces en ligne (dont je vous parle régulièrement) sont nombreuses. Cela peut provoquer des catastrophes humaines, mais également économiques et c&rsquo;est aussi un terrain d&rsquo;affrontement pour les armées du monde entier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est pour ça que j&rsquo;aimerai vous présenter le <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://me.korben.info/12e-bts-stcyr-drhat\" target=\"_blank\">BTS Cyber-Défense de Saint Cyr</a> qui est une formation assez unique en son genre puisqu&rsquo;elle a été lancée en 2017 sur l&rsquo;initiative de l’Armée de Terre et des services spécialisés du Ministère des Armées. Il s’agit avant tout de répondre aux besoins de recrutement de l&rsquo;armée en matière de cybersécurité. C&rsquo;est un peu comme si l&rsquo;armée vous disait : &nbsp;«&nbsp;<em>Vous aimez la cybersécurité ? Alors, venez nous aider à protéger notre pays !</em>&nbsp;». </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Les combattants numériques (#JDEF)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9d50jUXV-w?start=546&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Je suis sûr que si vous êtes encore au lycée</strong>, en sortie de Bac STI2D, Bac Scientifique ou Bac Pro SN, ça peut vous intéresser. Il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un <strong>BTS CIEL </strong>(Cybersécurité, Informatique et réseaux, Électronique, anciennement BTS SNIR)  reprenant en totalité le programme officiel de l&rsquo;Éducation Nationale, sauf qu&rsquo;en plus, ils y ont rajouté des spécificités propres au Ministère des Armées. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce <a href=\"https://me.korben.info/12e-bts-stcyr-drhat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>BTS Cyber-Défense de Saint Cyr</strong></a> va bien au-delà d&rsquo;une simple formation de 2 ans après le bac : c&rsquo;est carrément une nouvelle vie qui s&rsquo;offre à ceux qui choisiront cette voie puisqu&rsquo;un contrat d&rsquo;engagement est signé avec le Ministère. Vous serez logé (c&rsquo;est de l’internat), nourri et blanchi avec un peu d&rsquo;argent de poche et en 2 ans, vous obtiendrez un niveau opérationnel se rapprochant de celui de quelqu&rsquo;un qui aurait fait une licence. Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, c&rsquo;est une formation intense.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/7uv-bts-stcyr-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et en sortie, lorsque vous réussirez votre diplôme, <strong>un emploi vous sera proposé</strong> (et il sera obligatoire), soit en tant que civil pour rejoindre les services spécialisés du Ministère des Armées (Commandement des systèmes d’information, cyberdéfense, renseignement), soit en tant que militaire, c’est-à-dire que vous intégrerez un régiment quelque part en France. Vous suivrez alors une formation complémentaire spécifique, soit à l’École des Transmissions, soit au sein du service pour lequel vous travaillerez. Et si vous voulez continuer les études, et bien c’est toujours possible et même encouragé, mais uniquement en cours à distance / cours du soir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est ouvert à toutes les personnes de nationalité française et vous n&rsquo;avez pas nécessairement besoin d&rsquo;avoir des connaissances en informatique à l&rsquo;entrée. Il faut juste être motivé, exigeant avec soi-même et avoir une très bonne capacité de travail. Et surtout, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, être bien motivé pour travailler au Ministère des Armées. Notez que les admissions dans cette formation sont également ouvertes aux candidats en réorientation après une première année d&rsquo;études dans un domaine scientifique ou technique.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts2-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132531\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts2-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts2.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors y&rsquo;a quoi exactement dans cette formation de 40h de cours par semaine ? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et bien évidemment, vous aurez des cours de cybersécurité (connaissance du milieu, défense et attaque) à hauteur de 4h par semaine, des cours d’anglais (4h par semaine au total) avec le passage du TOEIC, histoire d’être au point. Il y a également 4h de sport par semaine donc c’est mieux si vous êtes en bonne condition physique. Et également une préparation militaire supérieure. Ça veut dire que vous allez tout apprendre sur la chose militaire, de la reconnaissance des grades au maniement des armes en passant par une formation de commandement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts3sport-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132528\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts3sport-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts3sport-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts3sport-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts3sport.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Hé oui, c’est indispensable puisqu’après, ceux qui choisiront la voie militaire pourront se retrouver en train de taper des lignes de commande dans un shell lors d’une opération dans un pays étranger. Bref, un boulot de technicien supérieur dans des conditions de travail exceptionnelles, des moyens uniques avec des missions que vous ne pourriez jamais réaliser dans une entreprise classique, comme de la lutte informatique réellement offensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici un peu à quoi ressemble le quotidien d&rsquo;une personne qui a suivi ce cursus au sein de l&rsquo;armée :</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Cyber, un combat virtuel bien réel (#JDEF)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HM_XUsLbNvo?start=885&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Des travaux pratiques sont également donnés par des employeurs militaires et civils, ce qui vous permettra d’être bien dans le bain avec la réalité du terrain et en fin de première année, vous effectuerez 5 semaines de stage au Ministère des Armées, histoire de parfaire encore plus votre formation en vous confrontant aux réalités du métier.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts4-prof-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132527\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts4-prof-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts4-prof-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts4-prof-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/bts4-prof.webp 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est cool également avec cette formation, c&rsquo;est que tout est teinté cybersécurité, y compris les cours plus traditionnels d&rsquo;informatique, et que les profs sont tous issus du monde professionnel, avec pour certains, une expérience dans le secteur de la défense. Donc si vous aimez la cybersécurité et votre pays, je pense que c&rsquo;est une voie intéressante à envisager, avec tous les avantages d&rsquo;une carrière militaire (qui a dit la retraite ? );-))</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si ça vous chauffe, vous pouvez faire votre demande <a href=\"https://me.korben.info/hyn-bts-stcyr-parcoursup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sur <strong>ParcourSup</strong> en cliquant ici</a>.

Les vrais utilisent depuis toujours le package iproute-tc (prononcez ipéroute et pas i-prout, s&rsquo;il vous plait), qui est un outil permettant de contrôler le trafic réseau mais pour aller à l&rsquo;essentiel sans se prendre la tête, le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de se tourner vers Wonder Shaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonder Shaper utilise TC d&rsquo;Iproute mais simplifie totalement son fonctionnement. Pour l&rsquo;installer, clonez ce dépôt : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper.git</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Placez vous dedans, puis lancez la commande comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>./wondershaper -a eth0 -u 4096 -d 8192</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Remplacez eth0 par le nom de votre interface réseau (ifconfig vous aidera à connaitre leurs noms). Puis spécifiez avec le paramètre -u la quantité d&rsquo;upload que vous voulez autoriser. Ici c&rsquo;est 4 Mbps. Et avec le paramètre -d, la quantité de download. Ici c&rsquo;est 8 Mbps.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1925555768\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Et voilà.

Tout d&rsquo;abord, j&rsquo;en peux plus de ces fake news, de ces ramassis de conneries et de tout ce que les assombris du bocal relaient toute la journée sur leurs réseaux sociaux ou sur des médias douteux. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je pense vraiment qu&rsquo;on devrait faire fermer tous ces sites qui font la promotion de ces fausses informations tant cela fait des dégâts dans notre société. Et également, dans le respect et avec beaucoup de tendresse, écarteler les gens qui relaient ces fake news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si je trouve ça bien que Google mette ce genre de chose en avant, c&rsquo;est parce qu&rsquo;il faut se rendre à l&rsquo;évidence : La plupart des gens sont de grosses feignasses quand il s&rsquo;agit de vérifier une information.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-888526240\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Par manque de temps bien sûr, et parce qu&rsquo;à l&rsquo;école, on ne leur a jamais vraiment appris à faire preuve d&rsquo;esprit critique ou à aller au-delà de ce qu&rsquo;on peut lire. Et même si je me souviens avoir appris à décomposer un article de presse, je n&rsquo;ai jamais dans le cadre scolaire, appris à comprendre et analyser une information ou à déterminer la fiabilité d&rsquo;un relai d&rsquo;information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, dans la tête de la plupart d&rsquo;entre nous, un article sur FranceTV Info, sur JeanMarcMorandini, sur FranceSoir, ou encore sur une page Facebook quelconque, a la même valeur, la même crédibilité car : « Vue sur Internet ».</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/conspi-734x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132152\" width=\"611\" height=\"852\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/conspi-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/conspi-215x300.jpg 215w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/conspi-768x1071.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/conspi.jpg 1004w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Donc comme les gens sont ce qu&rsquo;ils sont, et qu&rsquo;on ne va pas se transformer en debunkeur du jour au lendemain, encore moins en croisant des sources, c&rsquo;est plutôt cool qu&rsquo;on mette ce genre d&rsquo;information directement sous le nez de tout le monde.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je tiens d&rsquo;ailleurs à saluer les journalistes qui font, contre vents et marées, ce travail abominable de fact checking qui consiste dans la plupart des cas, à rappeler des évidences scientifiques en le sourçant pour se faire ensuite insulter sur Twitter par des centaines d&rsquo;abrutis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors même si je sais que les esprits les plus stupides proclament à longueur de journée que « <em>EUX, font leurs propres recherches</em> » et que l&rsquo;ouverture de leur bouche est inversement proportionnelle à leur ouverture d&rsquo;esprit, la vérité, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;ils cherchent que dalle et se contentent de répéter bêtement les âneries de leurs influenceurs hyper-stars (je vous laisse deviner lesquels).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors pour ceux qui peuvent encore être un peu sauvés, car pas dans la croyance, et qui se posent effectivement des questions, j&rsquo;ai ce qu&rsquo;il vous faut.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1191227137\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Grâce à Google, vous allez pouvoir vérifier si toutes les « informations » que Tata Corinne ou votre collègue Thierry relaient sur Facebook / Twitter / TikTok sont fondées.

Cela implique donc par exemple <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">les data brokers</a> dont j&rsquo;ai déjà parlé sur ce site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer, les data brokers vont récupérer vos informations personnelles (depuis différents services et base de données) et essayer de les croiser pour obtenir une fiche la plus complète possible à votre propos. De l&rsquo;adresse mail, à l&rsquo;adresse physique en passant par vos mots de passe ou vos données bancaires. Cela dans le but de les revendre à prix d&rsquo;or à des démarcheurs ou d&rsquo;autres organismes. Selon le data broker&nbsp;cette recherche&nbsp;va aller de simplement récupérer des informations légales (que vous avez données à divers services/sites) jusqu&rsquo;à l&rsquo;illégalité pure et simple (hack de base de données, etc.). Bref le panel est large et croyez-moi, VOS infos sont chez des dizaines d&rsquo;entre eux (voir mon <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">test personnel d&rsquo;Incogni</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce sont ces revendeurs&nbsp;et ces acheteurs&nbsp;qui sont entrés un peu plus dans le collimateur de la CNIL depuis début de l&rsquo;an dernier. Avec un rappel prononcé de leurs obligations en décembre 2022. Ce qu&rsquo;il faut savoir c&rsquo;est que ce genre de pratique n&rsquo;est PAS interdite par le RGPD, ce n&rsquo;est donc pas aussi simple que de dire qu&rsquo;il faut tous les épingler, il existe une marge de manoeuvre.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"360\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/b96-incognicnil-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La première chose qui leur est demandée est justement de<strong> s&rsquo;assurer de la légalité des données</strong>. Notamment qu&rsquo;elles ont bien été récoltées avec l&rsquo;accord de la personne.&nbsp;Dans la majorité des cas ce sera&nbsp;que la personne a bien validé ou coché la case des conditions générales &amp; Co lorsqu&rsquo;elle s&rsquo;est inscrite ou qu&rsquo;elle a rempli&nbsp;un formulaire. Pour ceux qui refusent ces transmissions de données dès l&rsquo;inscription, cela ne doit bien entendu&nbsp;jamais se retrouver chez un data broker, et encore moins être revendu par ce dernier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le second point c&rsquo;est que <strong>les données ne soient pas conservées plus longtemps que ne le demande la CNIL</strong>. À savoir 3 ans après la fin de l&rsquo;acte qui a généré la relation commerciale (que ce soit l&rsquo;achat sur un site e-commerce, la&nbsp;délivrance d&rsquo;une&nbsp;prestation diverse, la fin d&rsquo;une garantie&nbsp;&#8230;). De plus, tout ce qui a trait à la gestion d&rsquo;un contentieux, à la comptabilité, etc. (bref toute la paperasse administrative) doit être exclu&nbsp;par défaut&nbsp;et ne pas être partagé.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Là où le règlement de la&nbsp;CNIL va plus loin, c&rsquo;est dans le fait que les acquéreurs des données&nbsp;doivent eux aussi s&rsquo;assurer que tout est légal. Et nous en informer (dans un délai d&rsquo;un mois), en citant leur source, si ce n&rsquo;est pas le cas.&nbsp;Nous dire à&nbsp;qui ils ont acheté nos informations en somme et nous demander notre accord. Et ça, c&rsquo;est plutôt cool parce que ça permet de savoir où nos infos ont trainé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"320\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/WmjRRRrcUgb1WXM24M/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ils doivent pouvoir prouver que nous avons donné notre consentement pour tout démarchage. C&rsquo;est parfois inscrit de manière explicite dans les conditions générales ou les formulaires que nous validons en créant un compte quelconque. En vous inscrivant sur WhatsApp, vos données sont partagées avec Facebook &amp; Co. Ce genre de choses. Dans le cas inverse à lui de recueillir votre assentiment. Et si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas d&rsquo;accord, il doit respecter votre demande de retrait/modification de sa liste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, ça, c&rsquo;est la théorie. Pas toujours simple à faire respecter ou difficile à gérer au cas par cas. Comment vraiment savoir qui a quoi ? À qui avez-vous donné les droits de partage sur tel site en 2017 ? Etc. Si vous préférez déléguer ou prendre les devants, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\">il y a Incogni</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme je l&rsquo;ai déjà expliqué dans d&rsquo;autres articles, le job d&rsquo;Incogni va être proactif, avant même que les sociétés aient à vous contacter. Vous lui indiquez les données que vous acceptez de partager et celles que vous ne voulez plus voir sur le web et il va faire le taf à votre place.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"281\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/vN3fMMSAmVwoo/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il commencera par analyser le contenu de ce que possèdent des dizaines de data brokers sur vous. Et ensuite il les contactera pour leur demander de supprimer ce qui ne vous convient pas. De cette manière les acheteurs n&rsquo;auront déjà plus accès à ces informations lorsqu&rsquo;ils vont acquérir une base de données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si les data brokers ne font pas le boulot ? Incogni va continuer à les harceler régulièrement. Et si cela ne suffit toujours pas ? Alors vous pourrez peut-être vous tourner vers la CNIL. Mais, pour&nbsp;5-6€/mois, le service de Surfshark est plutôt pratique. J&rsquo;ai pris quelques minutes pour mettre en place mon test et depuis ce sont des dizaines de brokers qui m&rsquo;ont retiré de leurs listes. Et qui continuerons, car l&rsquo;outil veille au grain pour le cas où ils me réintégreraient en scred.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Testez Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Et bien cela commence peu à peu à revenir à la normale, avec le rendez-vous tech&nbsp;annuel <strong>Master Dev France</strong>&nbsp;(ex meilleur Développeur de France&nbsp;qui a&nbsp;été lancé en 2013 pour la première fois),&nbsp;après&nbsp;une pause de&nbsp;2 ans, crise sanitaire&nbsp;oblige).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cet évènement majeur propose notamment le plus grand concours de code en live (sans filet !) de l’Hexagone, ainsi que diverses conférences animées par des personnalités de la tech et en lien avec des sujets qui nous parlent à tous !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce 9 mars 2023 marque donc la 8e édition et <strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/3RrFwiX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vous pouvez vous y inscrire gratuitement</a></strong> !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"284\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/ler-MDF-trk\" alt=\"Master Dev France 2023\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous n’avez jamais participé à l’une des précédentes&nbsp;éditions, et que vous ne savez pas trop à quoi vous attendre, vous pourrez y retrouver un tas d’activités différentes. Il y a bien sûr la partie salon ainsi que de nombreuses animations qui prendront une place conséquente au bâtiment de la Porte de Versailles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous&nbsp;allez pouvoir y&nbsp;retrouver plusieurs dizaines d’entreprises (grands groupes français, associations majeures du numérique&nbsp;…), des écoles de la tech, des éditeurs…&nbsp;qui présenteront leur travail et/ou vous feront participer à divers workshops, etc. Sans oublier les médias qui vont se faire le plaisir de relayer l’évènement&nbsp;! Bref vous allez pouvoir mettre les mains dans le cambouis et faire un truc assez fou : discuter avec de vraies gens et leur&nbsp;poser des questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et en spécial bonus, <strong>Master Dev France offrira un NFT</strong> réalisé par l’artiste Léo&nbsp;Caillard&nbsp;à chaque visiteur de l&rsquo;événement ! Les visiteurs pourront collecter des&nbsp;NFTs&nbsp;auprès des partenaires de l&rsquo;événement&nbsp;via des QR codes&nbsp;disposés&nbsp;à l&rsquo;entrée et sur leurs stands.&nbsp; Partenaire de la Talent&nbsp;Fair, évènement RH dédié aux développeurs et recruteurs du Web3, Master Dev France offrira à ses visiteurs une expérience unique : la fusion de son NFT avec celui de la « Talent&nbsp;Fair&nbsp;» de&nbsp;la Paris Blockchain Week. Une première mondiale dans le cadre d’un événement professionnel !&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le programme prévoit&nbsp;<strong>une bonne&nbsp;vingtaine de conférences</strong>&nbsp;sur des sujets tech d’actualité, notamment&nbsp;le <strong>Web3</strong>&nbsp;(et l’Internet décentralisé au sens large),&nbsp;&nbsp;l’<strong>Intelligence Artificielle</strong>, les applications quantiques du futur…Du coup ce sera l’occasion d’avoir de bonnes introductions pour ceux qui voudraient en apprendre plus sur le&nbsp;métavers, la blockchain, le hack éthique, la cybersécurité, la régulation dans la crypto,&nbsp;l’éthique autour de l’IA, les algorithmes, l’inclusion numérique etc. En fin de journée, il y aura même un concert gratuit ! Ne mangez pas trop à midi, il faudra être en forme&nbsp;😉</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xPEQktRd4wa15ppQwq/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En parallèle de ces conférences&nbsp;(et c’est ce qui fait battre mon petit cœur un peu plus fort), il y aura <strong>un&nbsp;gros concours pour les développeurs et développeuses</strong>. Le choix des armes sera assez vaste puisque chacun pourra choisir son langage préféré parmi une liste de 15 (PHP, Python, Java, C++ …).&nbsp;2000 participants de toute l’Europe sont attendus pour ce concours de code live qui offrira 3 très beaux challenges algorithmiques et des prix plutôt sympas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus de 30 000€ sont à se répartir entre les meilleurs. Il y aura même une récompense pour celui ou celle qui codera de la manière la plus écoresponsable. 7 sessions qualificatives (sélection des 25 meilleurs de chaque)&nbsp;+ la finale qui&nbsp;formeront une sorte de fil rouge de la journée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous êtes dev et vous voulez participer ? Il est encore temps <strong><a href=\"https://www.masterdevfrance.com/concours/?utm_campaign=MDF&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=influence&amp;utm_content=korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">de vous inscrire via ce formulaire</a></strong>. Et si c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;un d&rsquo;entre vous qui l&#8217;emporte je veux <s>30% des gains</s> un « merci tonton Korben » sur scène lors de la remise du prix :p</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"266\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/h8ZRNWU2CDeA48fCYi/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sur place vous allez pouvoir jongler entre conférences et sessions de code live tout au long de la journée. Ce genre d’évent c’est souvent assez sport pour faire tout ce qui nous intéresse donc pensez à planifier un peu. Tout en sachant que votre planning va tomber à l’eau une fois sur place parce que vous vous serez laissé entrainer par un truc ou l’autre. En tous cas c’est toujours ce qu’il m’arrive&nbsp;😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une autre ambition de Master Dev France est de mettre en lumière la place des femmes dans le milieu du dev et de la tech. Eh oui, notre monde professionnel est encore trop souvent&nbsp;perçu comme un milieu où&nbsp;elles n’ont pas toute la présence qu’elles méritent. Cela se traduit notamment par une équipe 100% féminine pour le concours de code et la présence de nombreuses intervenantes expertes de leurs sujets&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/salon-mdf-2023.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132556\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/salon-mdf-2023.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/salon-mdf-2023-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La journée (qui attend 5000 visiteurs)&nbsp;est organisée par <a href=\"https://www.docaposte.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Docaposte</a>, la filiale numérique de La Poste, experte dans le traitement de la data et des données sensibles en particulier (comme les signatures électroniques, l’hébergement des dossiers médicaux, l’archivage numérique ou tout ce qui touche à l’identité numérique…).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En tous cas&nbsp;ça fait du bien de revoir ce genre de salons et de conférences de manière&nbsp;régulière dans un monde post-pandémie !&nbsp;Des tas de devs et de geeks vont enfin pouvoir retrouver un semblant de vie sociale, quelques jours&nbsp;chaque année&nbsp;😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’évènement se tiendra le jeudi&nbsp;9 mars 2023&nbsp;au Parc des Expositions de Paris,&nbsp;Porte de Versailles – Hall 5.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/3RrFwiX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inscrivez-vous gratuitement au&nbsp;Master Dev France 2023 !</a></h2>\n",

Il connaît également tous les arguments de curl (il y en a plus de 300 !!), y compris ceux qui ont été supprimés des versions récentes (et donc ignorés la plupart du temps). Il peut également convertir les données JSON en objets natifs et génère le code capable de le lire soit à partir d&rsquo;un fichier ou d&rsquo;un flux en entrée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malheureusement, seul le protocole HTTP est pris en charge, et les générateurs de code pour d&rsquo;autres langages sont moins complets que le générateur pour Python. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour utiliser <a href=\"https://curlconverter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">curlconverter</a>, vous pouvez l&rsquo;installer en tant que bibliothèque JavaScript avec la commande </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>npm install curlconverter</code></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou comme outil utilisable en ligne de commande comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>npm install --global curlconverter</code></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici un exemple de code généré à partir de cette commande :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ curlconverter --data \"hello=world\" example.com\nimport requests\n\ndata = {\n    'hello': 'world',\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post('http://example.com', data=data)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1758613486\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Bref, super pratique pour ceux qui veulent se simplifier le processus de création de requêtes HTTP dans leur langage favori, tout en se reposant sur des commandes curl plus familières.</p>\n",

On les développe ou on les utilise sans vraiment se poser de question sur leurs performances réelles. Et c&rsquo;est dommage car en tant que développeur, vous aimeriez peut être mesurer le temps d&rsquo;exécution d&rsquo;un script shell pour savoir s&rsquo;il est plus rapide qu&rsquo;une version précédente. Ou pouvoir comparer la rapidité d&rsquo;exécution de différents programmes afin de sélectionner le meilleur !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pas de souci, j&rsquo;ai ce qu&rsquo;il vous faut. Cela s&rsquo;appelle <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Hyperfine</strong></a> et c&rsquo;est un outil de benchmarking qui s&rsquo;utilise en ligne de commande et qui permet de comparer les temps d&rsquo;exécution de différents programmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est très utile pour mesurer par exemple les performances des programmes qui effectuent beaucoup d&rsquo;écritures et de lectures sur un disque afin de voir comment ils se comportent avec ou sans cache, ou sur un disque dur ou un SSD. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyperfine dispose de nombreuses fonctionnalités pour vous aider à obtenir des résultats précis et fiables, notamment une analyse statistique sur plusieurs exécutions, la prise en charge de commandes shell arbitraires et un retour constant sur l&rsquo;avancement du benchmark et les estimations en cours.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-2718436\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Pour l&rsquo;utiliser, vous pouvez par exemple faire un benchmark de n&rsquo;importe quelle commande comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>hyperfine COMMANDE_A_EVALUER</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour tester la commande <code>sleep</code> par exemple, on fera comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>hyperfine 'sleep 0.3'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, par défaut, Hyperfine effectuera au moins 10 exécutions du programme et prendra sa mesure à chaque fois pendant 3 secondes pendant au moins 3 secondes. Notez que vous pouvez changer cette durée de test en utilisant l&rsquo;option <code>-r</code> ou <code>--runs</code> et en spécifiant la durée derrière.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"754\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7a31394f5978452e676966.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132051\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous souhaitez comparer les temps d&rsquo;exécution de différents programmes, vous pouvez également passer plusieurs commandes à Hyperfine. Ainsi pour pour comparer les temps d&rsquo;exécution de <code>hexdump</code> et <code>xxd</code>, vous pouvez appeler hyperfine comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>hyperfine 'hexdump VOTRE_FICHIER' 'xxd VOTRE_FICHIER'</code></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Par exemple si vous avez un doute sur les performances d&rsquo;une nouvelle version d&rsquo;un outils, Hyperfine peut vous aider à la comparer avec une version précédente.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyperfine vous permet également de réaliser des benchmarks où un seul paramètre change à chaque exécutions. Ca permet de mesurer le comportement d&rsquo;un programme en fonction des paramètres que vous lui faites digérer. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-746537889\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Au niveau des exports, c&rsquo;es top puisque vous pouvez récupérer ensuite les résultats au format CSV, JSON, Markdown&#8230;etc afin d&rsquo;analyser ensuite tout ça au calme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">c&rsquo;est un petit outil en ligne de commande</a> qui ne paye pas de mine mais qui vous sera d&rsquo;une grande aide pour faire vos benchmarks et comparer le temps d&rsquo;exécution de vos propres codes ou d&rsquo;outils tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amusez-vous bien !</p>\n",

Du coup pour contourner ce problème, Apple a développé l&rsquo;émulateur Rosetta, qui permet d&rsquo;exécuter les applications non compatibles (pour architecture Intel quoi&#8230;) sur cette architecture ARM. C&rsquo;est cool, mais évidemment, c&rsquo;est moins performant donc il vaut mieux choper une version native de vos outils pour Silicon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>M&rsquo;enfin, si je vous parle de ça, c&rsquo;est parce que je passe ma vie dans le Terminal et parfois, certains outils fonctionnent mal également à cet endroit. J&rsquo;avais trouvé un moyen de lancer un terminal.app en mode de compatibilité Rosetta, mais Apple a bloqué la possibilité de dupliquer l&rsquo;application Terminal.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-imh-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131966\" width=\"243\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-imh-2.webp 344w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-imh-2-138x300.webp 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Tant pis, j&rsquo;ai trouvé une autre solution que je vous présente et qui est assez simple. Cela se passe au niveau de votre fichier .zshrc. Pour rappel, ce fichier de configuration est utilisé par le shell ZSH sur les systèmes d&rsquo;exploitation Unix / Linux, et donc macOS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il est consulté à chaque fois que ZSH est lancé et permet de personnaliser les paramètres et les comportements de ZSH selon vos préférences. Cela permet par exemple de changer le look de l&rsquo;interface de commande, d&rsquo;ajouter des alias ou encore des chemins d&rsquo;accès. Si vous n&rsquo;avez pas de Shell ZSH sur votre macOS, vous pouvez l&rsquo;activer par défaut en lançant un terminal et en tapant cette ligne de commande : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1640447358\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Nous aujourd&rsquo;hui, on va ajouter ces fameux alias pour pouvoir avoir un terminal compatible ARM ou INTEL à la demande. Ouvrez à nouveau un terminal sur votre Mac, et lancez la commande suivante pour ouvrir le fichier de config : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>nano ~/.zshrc</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajoutez ensuite les 2 alias suivants dans le fichier, à la fin de celui-ci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>alias arm=\"env /usr/bin/arch -arm64 /bin/zsh --login\"\nalias intel=\"env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh --login\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, je crée donc 2 alias : arm et intel qui vont permettre de changer l&rsquo;architecture utilisée par votre terminal zsh. C&rsquo;est aussi simple que cela.

Les scientifiques (et Fox Mulder) estiment que l&rsquo;astéroïde avait une taille d&rsquo;environ 40 m de diamètre et qu&rsquo;il voyageait à environ 15 km/s lors de l&rsquo;impact. Cet astéroïde est tombé dans une zone peu peuplée, ce qui a limité le nombre de victimes&#8230; Heureusement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"574\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fao.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131959\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fao.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fao-300x172.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fao-768x441.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fas.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131960\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fas.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fas-300x173.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-fas-768x444.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1544034974\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Impressionnant non ?

Donc ça peut être ce soir ou dans 10 millions d&rsquo;années, on ne peut pas y faire grand-chose. L&rsquo;avantage c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;on aurait surement un jour de congé le lendemain ;-))</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selon les estimations, il y a environ 1 million d&rsquo;astéroïdes de taille supérieure à 1 km de diamètre qui se baladent dans le système solaire et qui seraient une menace potentielle pour la Terre. Mais seulement 20 000 d&rsquo;entre eux ont été détectés et sont étudiés à ce jour&#8230; gloups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous aimez les catastrophes plus nucléaires, <a href=\"https://korben.info/bombe-nucleaire-quels-degats-chez-vous.html\">ça se passe par ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merci à Letsar pour le partage !</p>\n",

Les zombies sont bien dégueu quand même et je comprends mieux l&rsquo;objectif à long terme des champignons de Paris de prendre la capitale. Je suis retourné également au cinéma pour la dernière fois de ma vie, je pense, tant certains humains qui fréquentent les salles obscures font tout pour gâcher le plaisir des autres. J&rsquo;ai donc vu Avatar 2. C&rsquo;était bien, mais trop long et trop d&rsquo;eau partout. Je crois que j&rsquo;en ai encore dans les poumons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinon, bah toujours en mode bricole dans la maison. J&rsquo;ai encore de l&rsquo;enduit à faire, une chatière à poser, un poêle à bois à domotiser et quelques arbres arrachés avec la tempête à débiter. C&rsquo;est du taf ! J&rsquo;ai également commencé à regarder les presses à pellets et je ne sais pas encore si c&rsquo;est un bon investissement. Si vous pratiquez la fabrication de pellets, je veux bien un retour d&rsquo;expérience et des conseils :). Puis je cuisine toujours autant ce qui me permet de faire des économies et de manger mieux.

Voici un exemple de code pour illustrer la création d&rsquo;un nouveau fichier Excel et ajouter une feuille de calcul et une valeur à cette feuille. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/xuri/excelize/v2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    f := excelize.NewFile()\n    // Créer une nouvelle feuille.\n    index := f.NewSheet(\"Sheet2\")\n    // Définir la valeur d'une cellule.\n    f.SetCellValue(\"Sheet2\", \"A2\", \"Hello world.\")\n    f.SetCellValue(\"Sheet1\", \"B2\", 100)\n    // Définir la feuille active du classeur.\n    f.SetActiveSheet(index)\n    // Enregistrer le fichier xlsx par le chemin donné.\n    if err := f.SaveAs(\"Book1.xlsx\"); err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-100380283\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Easyyyy ! </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131924\" width=\"781\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, pour lire un fichier Excel, vous pouvez utiliser la méthode « ReadFile » comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/xuri/excelize/v2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    f, err := excelize.OpenFile(\"Book1.xlsx\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    defer func() {\n        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {\n            fmt.Println(err)\n        }\n    }()\n    // Obtenir la valeur de la cellule par nom de feuille de calcul donné et axe.\n    cell, err := f.GetCellValue(\"Sheet1\", \"B2\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    fmt.Println(cell)\n    // Obtenez toutes les lignes de la feuille Sheet1.\n    rows, err := f.GetRows(\"Sheet1\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    for _, row := range rows {\n        for _, colCell := range row {\n            fmt.Print(colCell, \"\\t\")\n        }\n        fmt.Println()\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xuri.me/excelize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pratique non ?</a></p>\n",

On peut également étendre ses fonctionnalités avec des modules si besoin.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/resizeHorizontal.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131906\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En termes de fonctionnalités, il permet d&rsquo;éditer des vidéos, d&rsquo;en créer « from scratch » à partir de couleurs et d&rsquo;effets aléatoirement générés et il prend en charge de toutes les résolutions comme des vidéos 4K ou des photos DSLR. Au niveau des exports, c&rsquo;est pareil, il peut aussi bien pondre un post Instagram (1:1), une story Instagram (9:16), un format pour YouTube (16:9) ou toutes les autres dimensions dont vous avez besoin. C&rsquo;est vraiment un outil génial pour les créateurs qui font de la vidéo et qui ont besoin de sortir un même contenu sur plusieurs plateformes qui acceptent des formats et des tailles de vidéos différentes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1763237998\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Voici un rendu d&rsquo;une vidéo produite avec Editly : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"This video was created from code!

Il supporte également du JavaScript / HTML5 Canvas / Fabric.js pour tout ce qui est « écrans personnalisés » ou pour pouvoir ajouter des superpositions dynamiques sur les vidéos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pourrez également exporter un GIF, ajouter des effets de vignette, conserver 1 seule source audio ou au contraire en mixer plusieurs, ou encore rajouter des fondus automatiques et de la normalisation sur le son.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ce qui concerne l&rsquo;installation, cette merveille peut fonctionner sous Windows, macOS ou Linux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour l&rsquo;installer, vous devez entrer la commande suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm i -g editly</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois installé, vous pourrez alors utiliser l&rsquo;interface en ligne de commande pour assembler rapidement une vidéo ou utiliser son API JavaScript  pour créer des choses plus complexes. Et comme je l&rsquo;évoquais avant, vous pouvez également utiliser des fichiers JSON pour spécifier les paramètres du montage attendu. Je vous invite à lire la documentation pour en savoir plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1143698013\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Ce mode de fonctionnement « automatisé » de l&rsquo;édition vidéo va vous faire gagner un max de temps si vous souhaitez par exemple créer un diaporama à partir de dizaines d&rsquo;images en rajoutant du texte par-dessus, ou encore créer une bande-annonce ou une vidéo promo.

Cette société qui a l&rsquo;ambition de changer le visage de la robotique en plaçant l&rsquo;imaginaire au cœur de la technologie a donc pour objectif de créer des « robots-personnages » qui sont à la fois performants dans leur travail, mais qui offrent également une expérience inédite pour les personnes qui le croisent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je ne savais vraiment pas ce que j&rsquo;allais voir et la surprise a été très agréable. La société porte bien son nom, puisque lors de la présentation, Miroki n&rsquo;a pas été présenté comme un robot purement fonctionnel, mais vraiment comme un personnage avec son univers, son histoire, etc. L&rsquo;objectif étant, je pense, d&rsquo;éviter l&rsquo;effet Uncanny Valley bien connu des concepteurs de robots humanoïdes, qui est le malaise ressenti par les personnes en présence d&rsquo;entités artificielles proches de l&rsquo;apparence humaine, mais pas tout à fait identiques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce robot qui nous a donc été dévoilé s&rsquo;appelle Miroki et il a été conçu et développé en moins d&rsquo;un an (un record !!) par les ingénieurs d&rsquo;Enchanted Tools. Pour la petite histoire, Miroki vient d&rsquo;une planète lointaine baptisée Miroko et décide de débarquer sur Terre pour venir nous rencontrer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Enchanted Tools — L&#039;origine des Mirokaï (Version Française)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVPKgBw4S7k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Certains diront qu&rsquo;il a été ensuite réduit en esclavage par les humains, mais je vous assure qu&rsquo;il vient bosser de son plein gré ^^.

Par exemple, comme mentionné sur cette pages, avec cette lib, vous pouvez coder des outils pour faire des trucs très cool comme : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ArpSpoofing</strong>: une application qui utilise les fonctionnalités de Packet++ et Pcap++ pour effectuer du spoofing ARP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Arping</strong>: une implémentation de l&rsquo;utilitaire arping en utilisant PcapPlusPlus.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DnsSpoofing</strong>: un utilitaire en ligne de commande qui effectue du spoofing DNS en utilisant Packet++ et Pcap++.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DNSResolver</strong>: un utilitaire en ligne de commande qui résout les adresses IPv4 pour un nom d&rsquo;hôte en utilisant les protocoles ARP et DNS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>IcmpFileTransfer</strong>: une application qui montre comment transférer des fichiers entre deux machines en utilisant uniquement des messages ICMP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HttpAnalyzer</strong>: une application qui analyse le trafic HTTP et fournit des informations détaillées sur le trafic, comme le nombre et le taux de paquets, la bande passante, le nombre et le taux de flux, les requêtes et les réponses HTTP, l&rsquo;histogramme des noms d&rsquo;hôte, l&rsquo;histogramme des types de contenu, l&rsquo;histogramme des codes d&rsquo;état et bien plus encore. Peut fonctionner sur du trafic en direct ou lire des paquets depuis un fichier pcap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SSLAnalyzer</strong>: une application qui analyse le trafic SSL/TLS et fournit des informations détaillées sur le trafic, comme le nombre et le taux de paquets, la bande passante, le nombre et le taux de flux, le nombre de messages SSL/TLS, l&rsquo;histogramme des noms d&rsquo;hôte, le nombre de versions SSL/TLS, le nombre de suites de chiffrement et bien plus encore. Peut fonctionner sur du trafic en direct ou lire des paquets depuis un fichier pcap.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme cette lib C++ est conçue pour être extrêmement rapide et légère, cela lui permet de traiter tous ces paquets très rapidement avec très peu de charge sur le système. Vous pourrez bien évidement l&rsquo;utiliser sur votre OS, que ce soit du Windows, du MacOS, du Linux, de l&rsquo;Android ou encore FreeBSD (les sources sont disponibles).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici un exemple d&rsquo;implémentation pour lire des paquets : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>// create a pcap file reader\npcpp::PcapFileReaderDevice pcapReader(\"input.pcap\");\npcapReader.open();\n\n// create a pcapng file writer\npcpp::PcapNgFileWriterDevice pcapNgWriter(\"output.pcapng\");\npcapNgWriter.open();\n\n// raw packet object\npcpp::RawPacket rawPacket;\n\n// read packets from pcap reader and write pcapng writer\nwhile (pcapReader->getNextPacket(rawPacket)) {\n  pcapNgWriter.writePacket(rawPacket);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une interface graphique facile à utiliser permet également de lire et d&rsquo;écrire ces fameuses trames réseau dans des fichiers, prenant ainsi en charge les formats de fichier PCAP et PCAPNG. De plus, il contient une implémentation unique de techniques de réassemblage de paquets, notamment le réassemblage TCP qui prend en charge la retransmission TCP, les paquets TCP hors ordre et les données TCP manquantes, ainsi que la fragmentation et le défragmentation IP pour créer et réassembler des fragments IPv4 et IPv6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avec <a href=\"https://pcapplusplus.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PcapPlusPlus</a> vous pourrez également filtrer les paquets ou générer des empreintes numériques TLS pour cibler et identifier les paquets réseau de manière beaucoup plus précise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, tout ça pour dire que si votre cafetière est connectée sur le réseau, PcapPlusPlus peut même faire le café !</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-462214832\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Allez, pour installer ce truc, <a href=\"https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/quickstart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">toute la doc est là !</a> Amusez vous bien !</p>\n",

Et aujourd&rsquo;hui je vais aborder l&rsquo;aspect de l&rsquo;enrichissement des données et comment Incogni peut aider sur ce point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais d&rsquo;abord on va commencer par le début : <strong>c&rsquo;est quoi l&rsquo;enrichissement des données</strong> ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous savez déjà que l&rsquo;Internet vous scrute avec des jumelles et que la plupart des acteurs essayent de gratter le maximum d&rsquo;informations vous concernant. Plus il y en a, plus elles sont personnelles et mieux c&rsquo;est pour eux puisqu&rsquo;il peuvent dresser un profil de plus en plus précis. Et ce qui permet d&rsquo;avoir cette précision c&rsquo;est souvent via le recoupement depuis plusieurs sources.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"626\" height=\"417\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/i6u-incogni-enrichissement\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous donnez vos nom, prénom et adresse mail pour télécharger un livre blanc sur un site marketing ? Vous avez un compte fidélité sur un site e-commerce de produits de santé spécifiques (asthme, maladie cardiaque &#8230;) et&nbsp;sur lequel vous êtes connecté avec le même email ? Vous répondez à un sondage sur les bienfaits du mariage? Vous avez une société pour laquelle&nbsp;nom, prénom, adresse &amp; Co&nbsp;se trouvent sur des sites officiels publics ? Et bien en mixant&nbsp;toutes ces sources&nbsp;on obtient un profil assez complet de qui vous êtes via&nbsp;cette méthode de l&rsquo;enrichissement de données. Ces différentes données peuvent être récupérées soit tout à fait légalement, soit <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">via des data brokers</a>, des bases&nbsp;en vente au marché noir, des fuites de données, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Korben : adolescent autour de la quarantaine,&nbsp;multiples enfants, habite l&rsquo;Élysée, achète en ligne (le plus souvent des produits écologiques et des frites surgelées), s&rsquo;inquiète de sa tension artérielle et a téléchargé l&rsquo;ebook « bien manger avec ses mains ». FLIPPANT DE PERTINENCE !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"264\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/bEVKYB487Lqxy/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce qu&rsquo;il faut comprendre c&rsquo;est que le plus souvent ce n&rsquo;est pas&nbsp;fait de manière illégale par ceux qui proposent un produit ou un service. Chacun va vous&nbsp;demander les informations dont il a besoin pour satisfaire son offre, mieux cibler sa publicité ou générer sa liste d&rsquo;abonnés,&nbsp;mais sans abuser non plus. Prenons l&rsquo;exemple du livre blanc au format PDF, est-ce que vous le demanderiez si le site vous demandait votre adresse physique,&nbsp;votre situation familiale&nbsp;ou autre ? Bien sûr que non, vous l&rsquo;enverriez&nbsp;sur les roses (avec raison). Idem si WhatsApp vous demandait de fournir un carnet de santé ou vos rémunérations mensuelles. Par contre les bases de données de ces sites ou la newsletter d&rsquo;un blog peut avoir été hackées sans même que leurs créateurs ne soient au courant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres services vous disent carrément qu&rsquo;ils récolteront des données vous concernant via d&rsquo;autres sites ou applis&nbsp;sur lesquelles vous êtes présents. Mais comme personne ne lit les petits caractères et que les termes employés sont volontairement vagues &#8230; ça passe. Des exemples ? Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Google ou Twitter. En signant chez eux, vous leur donnez le droit d&rsquo;aller chercher vos informations ailleurs (avec certaines limites et une anonymisation des données &#8230; normalement). Imaginez que vous ayez un profil tout ce qu&rsquo;il y a de plus corporate sur Facebook et que vous utilisiez Twitter pour propager des conspirations platistes ou reptiliennes&nbsp;à longueur de journée de manière anonyme. Et que vous avez utilisé le même mail ou le même téléphone pour les 2. Juste, imaginez.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"281\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/rr1DGz8pXZVHVDZyu6/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn est un bon exemple qui permet l&rsquo;enrichissement de données. Vous vous inscrivez sur un site quelconque avec nom et prénom et la société derrière ce site peut aller faire une recherche LinkedIn pour enrichir votre profil avec votre poste, l&rsquo;entreprise dans laquelle vous travaillez et autres infos. Ce qui va leur permettre d&rsquo;affiner leur communication avec vous, voire d&rsquo;aller vous relancer directement sur le réseau.

Une fois qu&rsquo;il vous aura donné la liste de ceux-ci, il va les contacter tous pour leur demander d&rsquo;effacer toute trace de votre existence.

C&rsquo;est un travail en cours de développement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131873\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg.webp 924w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg-300x244.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg-768x623.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est intéressant avec Cytopia, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il est en constante évolution. Les développeurs sont sans cesse en train de travailler sur de nouvelles fonctionnalités pour améliorer l&rsquo;expérience de jeu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Par exemple, ils prévoient d&rsquo;ajouter des biomes, ces grandes régions géographiques qui ont leur propre climat et leur propre faune et flore. Cela ajoutera une nouvelle dimension à la construction de vos villes, car vous devrez tenir compte des conditions climatiques et écologiques de chaque biome lorsque vous construirez vos quartiers et vos routes.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131874\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9.webp 924w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9-300x244.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9-768x623.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1068580014\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Les développeurs travaillent également sur un mécanisme de téléchargement de mods directement dans le jeu. Vous pourrez ainsi facilement télécharger les mods créés par d&rsquo;autres joueurs pour ajouter de nouvelles fonctionnalités, de nouvelles possibilités de constructions voire de nouveaux univers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bientôt des villes sur Mars ? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et comme Cytopia est un jeu open source, vous pourrez évidemment créer vos propres mods perso si vous le souhaitez. Bien sûr, Cytopia ne néglige pas non plus l&rsquo;aspect musical du jeu. Le jeu possède sa bande-son originale avec des bruits ambiants et des effets sonores qui sont tout simplement excellents. Vous vous sentirez vraiment immergé dans votre ville virtuelle rien qu&rsquo;à vous.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131875\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cytopia est disponible sur macOS, Linux et Windows, et il devrait également y avoir une version pour Android et iOS à l&rsquo;avenir. Les développeurs travaillent également sur un langage de script similaire à du LUA pour faciliter la création de mods. Si vous êtes intéressé par le développement de Cytopia, vous pouvez retrouver <a href=\"https://github.com/CytopiaTeam/Cytopia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">le code sur Github</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;hésitez pas à essayer le jeu et à vous impliquer dans la communauté des joueurs et des développeurs si le coeur vous en dit !</p>\n",

Par exemple, vous pouvez configurer un raccourci pour ouvrir un nouveau document dans votre traitement de texte préféré, ou pour lancer une recherche sur internet dans votre navigateur. Cela vous permet d&rsquo;accéder rapidement aux fonctionnalités que vous utilisez le plus souvent, sans avoir à naviguer dans les menus de l&rsquo;application ou à utiliser des combinaisons de touches compliquées. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1377407415\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Par exemple pour lancer quelques scripts Python, c&rsquo;est génial !</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gbammc/Thor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici !</a></p>\n",

Cela peut vous paraitre abusé, mais vous n&rsquo;imaginez pas le nombre de conneries que les gens peuvent dire avec certitude. Je vous encourage à vérifier également (et discrètement).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais savoir correctement utiliser un moteur de recherche et surtout faire du tri dans les informations qui sont renvoyées, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcement simple pour tout le monde. Il faut beaucoup de pratique pour éviter les sites chelous ou les conneries de fake news que les gens adorent se repasser parce que ça les conforte dans leurs délires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bien qu&rsquo;il ne soit pas parfait, Andi est peut-être le moteur de recherche du futur. C&rsquo;est un genre de chatbot capable de répondre à toutes vos questions pour peu que vous les écriviez en anglais. Hé oui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il y a quelques semaine, <a href=\"https://korben.info/chatgpt-openai.html\"><strong>j&rsquo;ai d&rsquo;ailleurs écrit un article sur OpenAI</strong></a> qui a lancé un chatbot, basé sur son algo GPT-3, qui utilise de l&rsquo;intelligence artificielle pour générer des réponses à des questions complexes. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-79307429\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Comme GPT-3, Andi est capable de fouiller des sources de contenus pour trouver les informations pertinentes et de les présenter de manière synthétique. Cependant, contrairement à Andi, qui se concentre sur les réponses aux questions, GPT-3 peut aussi générer du texte original sur un large éventail de sujets. En utilisant l&rsquo;intelligence artificielle pour traiter les données, ces outils peuvent fournir des réponses plus précises et plus complètes que ce que nous serions capables de faire manuellement. C&rsquo;est vraiment top !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andi peut ainsi répondre à des questions basiques comme « Quelle heure est-il ? » ou encore « Quelle est la capitale de l&rsquo;Italie ?&rsquo; &#8230;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-t57.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131723\" width=\"283\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-t57.webp 604w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-t57-242x300.webp 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>&#8230;ou des choses un peu plus complexes, sans aucune difficulté. Pour cela il sélectionne une liste de sources de contenus qui correspondent à votre demande et est capable de les analyser pour en sortir l&rsquo;essentiel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je lui ai demandé de me faire un résumé de la théorie des cordes et voici ce qu&rsquo;il m&rsquo;a répondu : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131727\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq-300x208.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq-768x531.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plutôt pas mal non ?

Ça me parait impossible et je suis de ceux qui pensent que Twitter a encore une belle et longue vie devant lui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez exporté vos données Twitter, vous avez dû remarquer que vous pouvez consulter tout ça au travers d&rsquo;une page HTML fournie dans l&rsquo;archive. Mais celle-ci présente plusieurs problèmes. Par exemple, si vous cliquez sur l&rsquo;une des images contenues dans un tweet, vous êtes renvoyé vers le site de Twitter. Ce qui est complètement con si demain votre compte est supprimé ou que Twitter disparait.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131709\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq-300x146.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq-768x374.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Comment télécharger une archive de vos données Twitter ?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme les tweets sont archivés en JSON, il est compliqué de simplement les copier-coller pour les mettre ailleurs. Même les images fournies ne sont pas exactement identiques à celles que vous avez envoyées. Elles sont étrangement plus petites. C&rsquo;est dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant les DM, même s&rsquo;ils sont présents dans l&rsquo;archive, on ne peut pas savoir qui les a envoyés puisque les noms des émetteurs ont été retirés de l&rsquo;archive. Enfin, les liens inclus dans les messages ne sont pas en clair, mais sont raccourcis. Donc impossible de savoir de quoi ça cause sans cliquer dessus. Et surtout, si un jour Twitter retire son domaine lié aux URLs raccourcies, et bien plus aucun de ces liens ne fonctionnera.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1495201034\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Tous ces petits détails ont incité Tim Hutton et ses amis à agir en proposant un script baptisé Twitter Archive Parser qui « répare » tous ces défauts. En effet, une fois lancé comme ceci sur votre archive&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python parser.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le script se charge alors de convertir tous vos tweets en markdown et HTML en y intégrant les bonnes images (dans leur taille d&rsquo;origine), les vidéos et les liens intégrés. Toutes les URLs raccourcies t.co sont ainsi remplacées par les vrais liens et les images récupérées sont stockées dans un dossier spécifique pour que vous puissiez ensuite les utiliser ou les stocker ailleurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131713\" width=\"351\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54.webp 635w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54-254x300.webp 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si des pseudos sont absents de l&rsquo;archive, ce parser est également capable de retrouver tous ces identifiants manquants directement depuis Twitter.com pour les réintégrer dans l&rsquo;archive. Les DMs sont également convertis en markdown avec leurs médias, leurs liens en clair et bien sûr le pseudo des gens qui vous les ont envoyés.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, l&rsquo;outil récupère également une liste de vos followers et de vos followings ce qui peut également servir pour d&rsquo;autres choses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si le script pour intéresse, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser\" target=\"_blank\">son code est sur Github ainsi que les explications techniques pour le lancer</a>.</p>\n",

Vous installez ntfy sur <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a> (<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">F-Droid</a>) ou <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS</a> et une fois que c&rsquo;est fait, vous choisissez un « topic » qui est un genre de clé. Cette clé est publique donc créez quelque chose de random et assez long pour que personne ne puisse la deviner. Autrement, quelqu&rsquo;un pourra s&rsquo;amuser à vous envoyer des notifications. Pour l&rsquo;exemple, je vais choisir « korben1234 »</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"338\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed.webp 338w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed-135x300.webp 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, il y a plus qu&rsquo;à balancer la notification via Curl comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>curl -d \"Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀\" ntfy.sh/korben1234</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>En Python, ça donnerait ça : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>requests.post(\"https://ntfy.sh/korben1234\",\n    data=\"Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀\".encode(encoding='utf-8'))</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1035933728\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>En JavaScript : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>fetch('https://ntfy.sh/korben1234', {\n    method: 'POST', // PUT works too\n    body: 'Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀'\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est aussi simple que ça, avec un simple POST HTTP, vous pouvez recevoir ces petites alertes bien pratiques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici une démo en vidéo : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-prise-en-charge-des-contenus-embarques wp-block-embed-prise-en-charge-des-contenus-embarques\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-131698-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4\">https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4</a></video></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez personnaliser les entêtes du message, mettre une icône, joindre une image, mettre un titre et bien d&rsquo;autres choses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est le genre de petit service qui n&rsquo;a l&rsquo;air de rien, mais qui fait des miracles et sait rapidement se rendre indispensable. Ce qui est cool avec ntfy, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez <a href=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">l&rsquo;héberger vous-même</a> puisque le projet est open source.

La première, c&rsquo;est un clone de Daisy Disk (logiciel payant) qui vous permet de débusquer les fichiers les plus gros qui trainent sur votre ordinateur. Si vous avez de vieux films, de gros zip ou des programmes d&rsquo;install volumineux, celui-ci saura les retrouver et vous pourrez les dégager d&rsquo;un simple clic.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131682\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La seconde fonctionnalité vous permettra de partir à la chasse de tous les fichiers que vous avez en double. De quoi dégraisser le Willy sans douleur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131685\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Enfin, la dernière fonctionnalité nommée « Organizer » va vous permettre de faire le tri dans un répertoire en passant très rapidement en revue tout ce qui s&rsquo;y trouve pour le supprimer ou le classer dans des répertoires. Cette fonctionnalité est très utile si vous êtes comme moi et que vous stockez des centaines de fichiers dans des dossiers sans vraiment savoir ce qu&rsquo;il y a dedans. Vous pourrez facilement identifier les fichiers que vous n&rsquo;avez pas utilisés depuis longtemps et les supprimer pour gagner de l&rsquo;espace sur votre disque dur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131686\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme je le disais, Shorui est gratuit et c&rsquo;est vraiment pratique !

Il nous explique les règles, le déroulement, on se déplace sur une carte et à chaque arrêt, on va pouvoir modifier son deck (ajouts, modifications de cartes, etc.) ou combattre avec. Si l&rsquo;on perd, on recommence à zéro. Enfin pas totalement, car on débloque quand même des éléments qui vont rester d&rsquo;une partie à l&rsquo;autre. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-90183500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Au niveau du jeu en lui-même, le système ressemble à ce qu&rsquo;on peut connaître chez <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/fr-fr\" target=\"_blank\">Hearthstone</a>, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/fr\" target=\"_blank\">Magic the Gathering</a>, etc. mais bien sûr avec des subtilités qui lui sont propres (par exemple, il faut sacrifier une carte pour pouvoir en jouer une autre !

Pourtant il n&rsquo;est pas exempt de défauts, on va en parler, mais disons que le hérisson bleu n&rsquo;avait jamais réussi à me convaincre totalement depuis son passage à la troisième dimension. Certains titres étaient plutôt réussis (les Sonic Adventure, Generations, Colours, ou même Secrets Rings si si) mais j&rsquo;étais loin d&rsquo;y prendre autant de plaisir que sur Megadrive, ou plus récemment sur <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QcnqB1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonic Mania</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ça démarrait plutôt mal : des environnements « réalistes » un peu ternes et vides, des ennemis au design triste et grisâtre, un aspect sonore très épuré avec de faux airs de <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3icYk8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breath of the Wild</a>, des structures (rampes, loopings, ressorts…) qui semblent flotter dans le ciel… Bref, pas très envie d&rsquo;y jouer…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132059\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">La magie opère !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pourtant, manette en main, ça fonctionne !

Par exemple, résoudre une énigme, réaliser un défi trouvé en chemin, entrer dans le cyberespace et faire la course dans un niveau « classique », se caler une <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NZMTMPZULU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">session de pêche avec Big The Cat</a>, dégommer un mini-boss… En faisant tout ça, on va obtenir des clefs, qui nous permettent de débloquer les <em>Chaos Emeralds</em>, qui nous permettent ensuite d&rsquo;affronter le boss de l&rsquo;île en mode Super Sonic ! 🔥</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132060\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Chaque combat demande une approche différente</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est simple mais sympa à suivre, les répliques sont bien écrites, on retrouve bien la personnalité de nos héros favoris, d&rsquo;ailleurs, bravo à l&rsquo;équipe de doublage car la version française est chouette ! Aussi, les musiques sont super variées, y a quelques titres vraiment entrainants. 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On déplore de rares soucis de maniabilité, et certaines phases de jeu frustrantes (le flipper par exemple…) qui entachent un peu l&rsquo;expérience. Aussi, les graphismes sur la version Switch sont un peu à la ramasse, c&rsquo;est parfois moche. Sur PC et consoles <em>nextgen</em>, le résultat est beaucoup plus agréable voire franchement joli, même si les îles restent trop vides et ternes à mon goût. J&rsquo;espère que dans une future suite, ils sauront nous proposer des mondes plus colorés et plus vivants !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Les niveaux du cyberespace sont chatoyants, eux !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Il n&#8217;empêche que c&rsquo;est un jeu vraiment agréable, pas prise de tête, qui nous propose du fun immédiat, une très bonne durée de vie… Et d&rsquo;ailleurs, des DLCs gratuits vont sortir tout au long de l&rsquo;année avec notamment de nouveaux personnages jouables (Tails, Amy Rose&#8230; &amp; Knuckles). 😉 Alors malgré ses défauts je ne peux que vous conseiller la dernière aventure de mon hérisson favori !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Acheter Sonic Frontiers sur <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jLRYgR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GeFGoz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 4</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ieloUf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 5</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GdOvPw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox Series S</a></h2>\n",

Apparue en 2009 sur les consoles <em>nextgen</em> de l&rsquo;époque, la licence est devenue une exclusivité Nintendo en 2014 avec la sortie de la première suite sur WiiU.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Bayonetta 3 – La sorcière en action (Nintendo Switch)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHt6drrs-Ww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Il aura fallu attendre 8 ans, rien que ça, pour <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q7vYJr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">la retrouver sur Switch</a> afin de dégommer les anges avec style et cheveux. Parce que voilà, si vous ne le saviez pas, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q7vYJr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bayonetta</a> est une sorcière qui utilise ses cheveux pour invoquer toutes sortes de choses, principalement des démons, mais aussi ses vêtements&#8230; C&rsquo;est pour ça que parfois elle est à moitié à poil. 😅 Rien de choquant je vous rassure, mais ça peut être un peu gênant si quelqu&rsquo;un vous regarde jouer par-dessus l&rsquo;épaule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un élément parmi d&rsquo;autres qui caractérisent cette ambiance complètement barrée, baroque, <em>over the top</em> : le scénario, lui aussi, part dans toutes les directions. C&rsquo;est vraiment fun, inattendu, appuyé par une mise en scène extrêmement généreuse. Des villes entières sont détruites, on se balade dans le multivers, on rencontre de nouveaux personnages, et aussi de nouveaux <em>gameplays</em> : l&rsquo;expérience est extrêmement variée !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132038\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Contrairement aux apparences, l&rsquo;action reste super lisible</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On reste sur une base de <em>beat&#8217;em all</em> / <em>hack&rsquo;n&rsquo;slash</em>, avec des combos et un système de <em>scoring</em> poussé. Si le jeu est facile à prendre en main, maîtriser les subtilités et enchaîner les platines ne sera pas une mince affaire ! Il y a pas mal de coups, d&rsquo;armes, de démons à débloquer, ce qui fait qu&rsquo;on découvre toujours de nouvelles choses, on enchaîne les combats sans se lasser. Les phases d&rsquo;explorations donnent envie de tout découvrir, y a plein de choses à trouver, bref, sur le contenu là aussi c&rsquo;est très généreux.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1243728482\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Mon niveau préféré se déroule en plein Paris, ambiance post-apo : sous une lune rouge on tabasse un gros monstre sur le toit de l&rsquo;arc de triomphe, puis on est poursuivi par une horde de flics zombifiés qui se mettent à danser façon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thriller</a>, pour finir avec un hommage au <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cinqui%C3%A8me_%C3%89l%C3%A9ment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cinquième Élément</a> (preuve de bon goût car il s&rsquo;agit du meilleur film du monde, non ?)… Ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un petit aperçu de ce qui vous attend !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132039\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Viola, nouveau personnage jouable, propose un gameplay plus agressif</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore une fois (et c&rsquo;est pour ça que je vous en parle), il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un titre que j&rsquo;ai beaucoup apprécié. Tout est fun et débile, le contenu est gargantuesque, la durée de vie est conséquente, le <em>gameplay</em> est doté d&rsquo;une profondeur saisissante.

Ainsi, vous pourrez récupérer une image PNG de la zone, convertir des coordonnées GPS, lancer une recherche Flickr ou Twitter sur la zone ciblée, ouvrir un éditeur GPX, calculer des distances entre deux points&#8230;et ainsi de suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors comment ça s&rsquo;utilise ? Et bien tout d&rsquo;abord, ajoutez un signet (bookmarklet) à votre navigateur en faisant glisser le lien suivant vers votre barre de signets : <a href=\"//tankaru.github.io/OpenSwitchMapsWeb/index.html#'+location.href;})();\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenSwitchMaps Web</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou en ajoutant la fonction suivant dans un bookmark :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>JavaScript:(function(){ window.location.href='https://tankaru.github.io/OpenSwitchMapsWeb/index.html#'+location.href;})();</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, ouvrez Google Maps ou un équivalent puis cliquez sur le bookmark. Et voilà, vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à choisir le service qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est super intéressant et pratique si vous interagissez souvent avec des services de cartographie et je suis certain que vous allez découvrir plein de services cools.</p>\n",

En effet, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarovaya_law#:~:text=The%20Yarovaya%20law%20(in%20Russian,terror%20and%20public%20safety%20measures.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">depuis 2016, la Russie oblige les prestataires Telecom</a> à conserver tous le contenu des appels audio, les données, les images et les messages textes qui seraient présents sur des serveurs localisés en Russie, ainsi que les métadonnées et cela pour 6 mois. Toujours d&rsquo;après cette loi, les réseaux sociaux ou logiciels de messagerie qui utilisent du chiffrement sont également forcés de conserver un accès aux communications chiffrées pour le FSB.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131601\" width=\"602\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;objectif avec <a href=\"https://spybuster.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SpyBuster</strong></a> est donc de détecter les logiciels qui auraient des connexions avec des serveurs russes.

D&rsquo;ailleurs, ce qui serait cool, c&rsquo;est que MacPaw étende ce logiciel à d&rsquo;autres pays sympathiques comme la Chine ou les États-Unis qui eux aussi ne se privent pas de piller les données personnelles des internautes.

J&rsquo;en ai déjà parlé plusieurs fois sur le site et selon différents angles : <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">faire respecter vos droits RGPD</a>, <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">lutter contre les data brokers</a>, faire effacer ses données personnelles, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais l&rsquo;outil a aussi une bonne raison d&rsquo;exister pour d&rsquo;autres problèmes annexes que l&rsquo;on peut rencontrer au cas par cas. Moins fréquents que ceux déjà cités, mais qui existe malgré tout. C&rsquo;est le cas par exemple des arnaques au CPF, ou Compte Professionnel de Formation. Arnaques qui sont en constante augmentation depuis plusieurs années, jusqu&rsquo;à représenter presque&nbsp;45 millions d&rsquo;euros en 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"267\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/14i-incognicpf\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme vous le savez, en France et depuis 2015, chaque personne active professionnellement&nbsp;recevait chaque année un crédit d&rsquo;heures donnant droit à suivre des formations. Sauf que depuis 2019 ce crédit d&rsquo;heures a été remplacé par de la moula, chaque travailleur&nbsp;reçoit sur&nbsp;un compte&nbsp;une certaine somme à dépenser « comme il veut ». Pas en frais de restaurant ou en vacances au soleil, calmez-vous hein, mais disons que chacun peut maintenant choisir le type de service qu&rsquo;il veut utiliser avec plus de latitude (formation en ligne, etc.). Plus de 38 millions de français reçoivent ainsi plusieurs centaines d&rsquo;euros chaque année, ça fait de belles sommes. Et qui dit pognon à se faire, dit vautours.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"488\" height=\"275\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/12huzxtUKCLVTy/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Des gens à plumer ? I&rsquo;m in.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sont donc apparus des escrocs qui ont commencé à se faire passer pour des organismes ou centres de formation officiels et qui cherchent à récupérer les fonds disponibles. Vous commencez donc à recevoir des mails/SMS/appels dans lesquels on va soit vous proposer une fausse formation (souvent assez cher), soit vous demander de vous connecter à votre compte formation via un lien qu&rsquo;ils vous fournissent (et à travers lequel ils vont être capable de voler vos identifiants).&nbsp;Certains allant même jusqu&rsquo;à vous suivre sur les réseaux sociaux pour vous démarcher. Et une fois que vous leur avez&nbsp;envoyé votre crédit,&nbsp;ils vont disparaitre dans la nature. En récupérant au passage&nbsp;vos informations personnelles qui pourront éventuellement leur servir également (revente à des data brokers, usurpation d&rsquo;identité, vol de mot de passe, etc.). Pas de gaspillage ma bonne dame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;ailleurs un petit rappel : vos droits à la formation n&rsquo;ont pas de limite maximale d&rsquo;utilisation, vous pouvez les utiliser quand vous voulez (dans 6 mois ou dans 10 ans). Avant de payer une formation quelconque, prenez le temps de vérifier qu&rsquo;elle est dans les clous, reconnue et validée. Ne vous contentez pas d&rsquo;une mention sur leur site web éventuel. Cela arrive plus souvent que vous ne le pensez, plusieurs milliers de travailleurs se font avoir chaque année. Si cela a été votre cas, vous pouvez le <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.moncompteformation.gouv.fr/espace-public/comment-signaler-une-escroquerie-sur-mon-compte-formation\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.moncompteformation.gouv.fr/espace-public/comment-signaler-une-escroquerie-sur-mon-compte-formation\" target=\"_blank\">signaler ici</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation.jpg\" alt=\"Mon compte formation\" class=\"wp-image-131930\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation-300x74.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Même si une loi&nbsp;devrait être mise en place bientôt pour réguler un peu tout ça (interdiction de démarchage abusif, référencement des organismes, etc.), il n&rsquo;en reste pas moins que vous avez des armes à votre disposition dès aujourd&rsquo;hui, <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dont Incogni</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avec Incogni, vous avez la possibilité de contrôler les informations personnelles qui sont accessibles sur le web. Vous pouvez ainsi demander aux services qui ont stocké des informations sur vous de les supprimer. Cependant, il est important de noter que ces services peuvent choisir de ne pas répondre à cette demande, en fonction de leurs propres politiques et de la loi en vigueur. Si cela se produit, le service Incogni peut intervenir pour s&rsquo;assurer que la demande est traitée de manière appropriée, mais il ne peut pas garantir que toutes les informations seront effectivement supprimées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pour avoir utilisé Incogni personnellement, je peux vous dire que l&rsquo;on ne se rend pas bien compte de qui a quoi comme donnée nous concernant. Des sociétés dont vous n&rsquo;avez jamais entendu parler se retrouvent avec vos noms, adresse, numéro de téléphone, parfois numéro de sécurité sociale&nbsp;&#8230; alors que vous n&rsquo;avez jamais donné toutes ces infos à un même site. La magie des données croisées. Il suffit d&rsquo;obtenir une base de données du service X, d&rsquo;acheter une autre d’Y, de profiter d&rsquo;un hack de la messagerie du&nbsp;réseau social Z, combiner les&nbsp;3 et pouf on un profil ultra complet. Facile ensuite de vous contacter en vous donnant une certaine impression d&rsquo;être officiel puisqu&rsquo;ils ont des infos qui sont censées être réservées à des services officiels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref si vous êtes sensible au respect de votre vie privée et/ou si vous voulez vous protéger à l&rsquo;avenir, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à jeter un oeil sur le service. Pour moins de 6€/mois, ils vont gérer tout à votre place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Découvrir Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Son nom : <a href=\"https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ChaiNNer</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChaiNNer est un outil de traitement d&rsquo;images qui utilise un fonctionnement à case de graphiques avec des noeuds et des liens entre ces noeuds, ce qui permet d&rsquo;enchainer des tâches relatives aux images. On y retrouve des fonctionnalités assez classiques de recadrage, de redimensionnement&#8230;etc., mais également des tâches infiniment plus complexes puisqu’utilisant des réseaux neuronaux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131556\" width=\"665\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot.webp 866w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot-300x260.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot-768x665.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, dans vos pipelines, vous pourrez augmenter la taille des images sans perte de qualité avec des algos de type ESRGan, ou rafraichir des photos anciennes avec des modèles de restauration de visage&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil codé en Python est disponible sur tous les OS (macOS, Windows, Linux) et supporte PyTorch, NCNN et ONNX. Une fois lancé, tout ce que vous avez à faire, c&rsquo;est de glisser / déposer des noeuds et de les connecter entre eux. Chaque poignée présente sur un noeud dispose de fonctions spécifiques selon sa couleur, ce qui permet de savoir quoi relier avec quoi. Un vrai jeu d&rsquo;enfant.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1448860395\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Et une fois que vous êtes satisfait de votre « pipe », vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à cliquer sur le bouton vert « Run » pour lancer le process.

Son nom : L&rsquo;AFG01 de  CHEFREE.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Une friteuse à air polyvalente</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je vous arrête tout de suite, rien à voir avec Xavier Niel.  <strong>L&rsquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/CHEFREE-dInt%C3%A9rieur-%C3%89lectrique-AFG01-Pr%C3%A9chauffer/dp/B0BKZNM4SC/sr_1_5?maas=maas_adg_C7D7ABCF7963E4E6C11F189EE3822130_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=amazon0d16-21&amp;__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=friteuse+sans+huile&amp;m=AYUC1COT3XCRR&amp;qid=1669964698&amp;qu=1-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AFG01</a></strong> est une friteuse à air de couleur noire mesurant précisément 42,6 cm de long sur 34,3 cm de large et de 34,7 cm de haut. Elle pèse environ 6 kg et est fabriquée en acier inoxydable ce qui lui donne une belle finition et la rend évidemment résistante à la corrosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au niveau de sa contenance, elle dispose d&rsquo;une capacité de 6 litres et est dotée d&rsquo;une puissance de 1660 watts, soit largement moins qu&rsquo;un four traditionnel</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l3x-chefree-ultenic\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est donc une friteuse à air de taille moyenne qui est assez puissante pour cuire rapidement et efficacement toutes sortes d&rsquo;aliments et pas uniquement des frites. Elle est conçue pour être utilisée en intérieur même pour vos grillades les plus extrêmes et est plutôt silencieuse, ce qui est un plus pour moi qui aime bien écouter de la musique quand je cuisine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Simplicité d&rsquo;utilisation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc eu l&rsquo;occasion de tester cet appareil de chez Ultenic depuis quelques semaines, et je dois dire que je suis vraiment content des plats que j&rsquo;ai cuisinés. Pour vous expliquer un peu mieux le truc, Ultenic est une marque qui possède une sous-marque appelée CHEFREE, spécialisée dans les appareils de cuisine comme ce grill « air fryer » AFG01.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous connaissez déjà les friteuses à air de la marque, sachez que l&rsquo;AFG01 de CHEFREE est plus polyvalente que les modèles précédents (K10 et K20). En effet, elle dispose de huit fonctions de cuisson différentes : barbecue, crisper, rôtir, cuire, griller, frire, steak et préchauffage (bon, OK ce n’est pas vraiment un mode de cuisson, mais je le compte quand même). </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132017\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132016\" width=\"578\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Autant vous dire que vous pouvez tout faire avec cet appareil, qui se comporte comme un mini four ! À titre perso, au même titre que la K10 et la K20, cet appareil me simplifie vraiment la vie tous les jours. Plus besoin d&rsquo;allumer mon four ou mes plaques de cuisson pour réchauffer un petit truc ou faire cuire une pognée de nuggets&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les accessoires inclus avec l&rsquo;AFG01 sont d&rsquo;ailleurs très utiles. Le panier à frites et la plaque de grill sont plutôt cool pour préparer des croquettes de poulet maison ou des steaks. Et j&rsquo;ai été agréablement surpris par la qualité de la cuisson notamment au niveau de la viande. Si vous dosez bien la température et le temps de cuisson, le résultat sera tendre et juteux à souhait. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132014\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Des résultats de qualité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je peux donc tout faire cuire avec cette friteuse à air qui je le rappelle a une capacité de 6 litres pour le bac, et de 4 litres pour le panier. Donc ça reste quand même un bon volume pour cuisiner pour 4 personnes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai par exemple fait des pavés de boeuf et la viande est restée saignante comme je l&rsquo;aime. Même chose avec les frites qui étaient croustillantes. Bref, on obtient le même résultat qu&rsquo;avec une friteuse à huile ou un barbecue bien chaud. Manque que l&rsquo;odeur du feu de bois&#8230; par contre, la dégoulinade d&rsquo;huile de friture ne me manque pas. Et contrairement à ce qu&rsquo;on pourrait penser, non, la viande ne se dessèche pas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132013\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Une cuisson rapide et efficace</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Grâce aux quatre niveaux de chauffage et à sa puissance de 1660 watts, vous pouvez facilement ajuster la chaleur pour cuire la viande à différents stades (saignant, moyen et bien cuit). Elle consomme également 80% d&rsquo;énergie en moins par rapport aux méthodes de cuisson traditionnelles, ce qui n&rsquo;est pas négligeable surtout en ce moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;AFG01 est également dotée d&rsquo;un système de préchauffage qui permet de régler la température en amont. Cela est très utile pour obtenir une cuisson uniforme et un meilleur « croustillant » de vos aliments. Par contre, il faudra être patient (c&rsquo;est le concept du préchauffage) et attendre quelques minutes avant de mettre les aliments dedans, mais cela en vaut vraiment la peine. Après vous pourrez retourner bidouiller sur le PC, et attendre que ça sonne.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Facile à nettoyer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le nettoyage de la CHEFREE, c&rsquo;est également très simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le revêtement anti-adhésif du bac et de la plaque de grill rend le nettoyage rapide et facile. Il suffit de rincer les pièces à l&rsquo;eau chaude et de les essuyer avec un chiffon doux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même si je ne fais pas de « conseil en investissement » (lol), je vous la recommande fortement, car pour un peu plus de 200 €,  c&rsquo;est loin d&rsquo;être un gadget. Je l&rsquo;utilise tous les jours avec sa petite soeur la K20 et je ne pourrais plus m&rsquo;en passer. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132015\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Je ne fais plus rien bruler, on mange beaucoup moins gras, je crame moins de gaz et d&rsquo;électricité, et les frites sont au top, y compris quand je les fais avec de vraies patates coupées en morceaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si j&rsquo;avais un petit bémol à apporter quand même, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;elle prend un peu de place et qu&rsquo;elle peut ne pas être adaptée à tous les espaces de rangement en raison de son couvercle qui s&rsquo;ouvre par le haut. C&rsquo;est à prendre en compte si vous avez une petite cuisine. Mais bon, à part ça c&rsquo;est vraiment top et une fois encore c&rsquo;est un appareil qui s&rsquo;appelle « friteuse à air » mais que je considère plutôt comme un mini four super efficace, paramétrable à souhait et polyvalent. Mon prochain projet avec, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;y faire cuire mon propre pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>60 euros de réduction sur l&rsquo;AFG01</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour encore plus d&rsquo;économies, profitez du code promo exclusif de 30 euros, valable jusqu&rsquo;au 24 décembre, en utilisant le code <strong>AFG01KORBEN</strong>.

L&rsquo;année arrive à sa fin et comme vous avez peut-être remarqué si vous me suivez sur <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch</a>, j&rsquo;ai commencé un petit break qui va durer jusqu&rsquo;au début janvier. Ne vous inquiétez pas, comme d&rsquo;habitude, j&rsquo;ai plein d&rsquo;articles programmés pour les jours qui viennent, donc ce sera totalement transparent pour vous 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je ne sais pas comment s&rsquo;est passé l&rsquo;année 2022 pour vous, mais pour moi, ça s&rsquo;est plutôt bien déroulé. Voici d&rsquo;ailleurs quelques « achievements » dont je suis plutôt fier. Tout d&rsquo;abord, j&rsquo;ai réussi à remettre ma coquille de noix (korben.info) sur pied malgré les difficultés économiques de l&rsquo;année dernière. Le trafic sur mon site a même plutôt augmenté, donc c&rsquo;est super cool et je retrouve beaucoup de plaisir à écrire, surtout en cette période de fêtes. C&rsquo;est donc une affaire qui roule 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mon compte <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@korbeninfo?lang=fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok</a> a également explosé, ce qui m&rsquo;offre également de nouvelles opportunités. J&rsquo;aime bien tourner ces petites vidéos et les gens ont l&rsquo;air de les apprécier, donc c&rsquo;est cool, je vais continuer. Ensuite, sur un plan personnel, j&rsquo;ai bien avancé dans les travaux à la maison. C&rsquo;est de plus en plus habitable même s&rsquo;il fait encore bien froid à l&rsquo;intérieur&#8230; Mais là, à part dépenser une fortune pour une isolation par l&rsquo;extérieur, je ne vois pas ce qui pourrait me sauver. J&rsquo;ai également obtenu mon permis tronçonneuse et j&rsquo;en suis extrêmement fier. Et enfin, je me suis enfin marié après avoir dû décaler la cérémonie de 2 ans à cause du Covid. Woohoo !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour 2022. C&rsquo;était cool et pour cette année 2023 qui arrive, je n&rsquo;ai pas spécialement d&rsquo;ambitions autres que de continuer sur ma lancée, c&rsquo;est-à-dire de faire plaisir aux <a href=\"https://patreon.com/korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreons</a> et de continuer à partager avec vous toutes mes découvertes tech au fil de l&rsquo;eau. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et vous, comment ça s&rsquo;est passé ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A très bientôt ! Et passez de bonnes fêtes de fin d&rsquo;année 🍾  !</p>\n",

Il y a les développeurs qu&rsquo;il faut chouchouter évidemment, mais également les designers et les gens du marketing afin que le « produit » qui est porté par votre entreprise rencontre un franc succès. Sacrée mission, et tout ça sans jamais perdre votre sourire ni votre sens de l&rsquo;humour !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pas simple 🙂</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/rr-talent-product-manager-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce métier de product manager est encore assez récent en France, mais a su se rendre indispensable dans de nombreuses entreprises Tech. Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, le rôle d&rsquo;un product manager est donc de faire correspondre les besoins des utilisateurs avec les attentes de la société qui l&#8217;emploie afin de créer un modèle économique pérenne. Le product manager doit donc garder un oeil sur la faisabilité technique du projet, sa facilité d&rsquo;utilisation et sa valeur en termes de business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cet article a été rédigé en partenariat avec&nbsp;<a href=\"https://me.korben.info/pbh-talentio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io</a>. Si ce genre de sujet vous intéresse, vous pouvez rejoindre leur communauté tech, le talent club. En vous inscrivant gratuitement, vous aurez accès à du contenu exclusif, comme des conseils d’experts qui travaillent chez Google, Deezer, Sorare&#8230; Vous aurez également accès à leur étude des salaires annuelle, ainsi que la possibilité de poser vos questions carrière à l’ensemble des 40 000 membre de manière anonyme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rejoignez la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/talent-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"429\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, la réussite d&rsquo;un projet se mesure sur l&rsquo;impact généré par le produit et non plus bêtement sur « Est-ce que ça a été livré ? ». On s&rsquo;éloigne donc d&rsquo;une mesure bête et méchante comme une « quantité de features » sorties pour plutôt mesurer si l&rsquo;application (ou l&rsquo;objet) a été un succès en matière d&rsquo;utilisateurs ou d&rsquo;acheteurs. C&rsquo;est beaucoup plus pragmatique comme approche et ça permet par la suite de prendre des décisions beaucoup plus éclairées sur les améliorations à apporter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, un produit réussi c&rsquo;est un produit qu&rsquo;on peut faire techniquement (ce n’est pas un scoop), qui sera utilisé régulièrement par les utilisateurs et enfin, c&rsquo;est un produit qui rapporte de l&rsquo;argent ou un fort gain de temps ou d&rsquo;efficacité. Si votre produit ne remplit pas ces objectifs, il vous faut un product manager, alors pourquoi pas vous ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alors en tant que dev, quelles sont les raisons principales de quitter son job de codeur pour devenir product manager ?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Déjà, ça peut paraitre idiot dit comme ça, mais vous aurez beaucoup plus d&rsquo;influence sur le projet. Avec votre vue d&rsquo;ensemble, vous déciderez des priorités et des objectifs à atteindre et c&rsquo;est vous qui mènerez le projet à son succès (ou à sa perte ^^).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le métier de product manager est également beaucoup plus varié. En tant que développeur, vous vous concentrez essentiellement sur des problématiques techniques, allant jusqu&rsquo;à compter les accolades dans votre code. Le product manager, avec une casquette technique, a l&rsquo;opportunité de travailler sur des problématiques plus larges qui vont bien au-delà du code. Cela peut être des aspects plus stratégiques comme la commercialisation, la capitalisation des retours utilisateurs, l&rsquo;amélioration du design&#8230;etc. C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;un certain point de vue, beaucoup plus enrichissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, devenir product manager ça veut aussi dire faire le lien entre toutes les équipes. Développeurs, designers, marketeux, data scientist, c&rsquo;est vous qui donnez le « la » et qui êtes le chef d&rsquo;orchestre de tout ce petit monde. Donc forcément, dans ce job, vous apprendrez énormément au contact des autres, à la fois techniquement et humainement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, tout n&rsquo;est pas tout rose et il y a de nombreux défis à relever quand on passe de dev à product manager. Vous serez responsable des enjeux commerciaux donc ce sera à vous de prendre les bonnes décisions pour que le produit « fonctionne » et rapporte à l&rsquo;entreprise. Vous devrez également gérer les conflits et les différences de points de vue entre les équipes et les personnes. Et vous devrez sans cesse décider de tout&#8230; Faire des choix sur la stratégie, sur la technique, sur les équipes&#8230; etc. Ces choix auront des impacts que vous devrez assumer. Bref, Product Manager, c&rsquo;est aussi savoir prendre des décisions difficiles.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131855\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si en sachant tout cela, ça vous botte encore, sachez qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas spécifiquement de formation pour passer de développeur à product manager. Vous devez être capable de comprendre les responsabilités, les compétences et les enjeux du métier. Vous devez être un excellent communiquant et surtout être très organisé avec une forte résilience / adaptabilité et une grande capacité d&rsquo;apprentissage, car ça va fuser dans tous les sens, je vous le promets ^^. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à trouver des mentors dans ce domaine et de bouquiner des livres sur le sujet, mais également de vous intéresser à tous les aspects du produit sur lequel vous travaillez. L&rsquo;objectif c&rsquo;est de montrer au sein de votre entreprise que vous êtes capable de travailler sur une mission de product management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez également renforcer ou travailler certaines compétences, sur lesquelles vous vous sentez plus fragiles comme la communication, la gestion de projet, la compréhension des enjeux commerciaux, etc. Il existe des formations et des tas de livres sur le leadership, l&#8217;empathie au travail et la communication. Vous pourrez ainsi rapidement mettre en oeuvre vos compétences sur des projets concrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si votre reconversion est dans un cadre de changement d&rsquo;entreprise, pensez à mettre en avant vos compétences de développeur dans votre candidature, pour montrer que vous avez les bases techniques pour rejoindre l&rsquo;entreprise comme product manager, tout en soulignant votre expérience de travail en équipe, vos capacités à résoudre des problèmes complexes et votre intérêt pour les enjeux commerciaux. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas, l&rsquo;objectif c&rsquo;est de convaincre un employeur potentiel que vous saurez lui apporter de la valeur en tant que product manager. Beaucoup plus que si vous étiez resté développeur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En conclusion, passer de développeur à product manager c&rsquo;est comme passer d&rsquo;un sport individuel à un sport d&rsquo;équipe : c&rsquo;est passionnant, stimulant et ça bouge tout le temps ! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, si vous avez envie d&rsquo;avoir une vue d&rsquo;ensemble sur un projet, de travailler vraiment en équipe et de prendre des décisions importantes, le job de product manager est probablement un métier qui vous conviendra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prêt à quitter le code pour devenir le prochain Didier Deschamps du numérique ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour plus de conseils sur votre carrière, vous pouvez rejoindre <a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">le talent club</a>.

Cela vous permettra ainsi de retirer, convertir ou extraire les pistes audio de vos vidéos, ou encore de créer des GIFs animés à partir de celles-ci. Vous pourrez également intégrer en dur les sous-titres sur une vidéo ou réparer / stabiliser une vidéo et j&rsquo;en passe.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"984\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131453\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m.webp 984w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m-300x229.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m-768x585.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref, très cool surtout que vous pouvez créer également vos propres presets en utilisant les paramètres de FFMpeg (mais là, faudra bosser un peu plus la documentation).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-530193462\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Tout ce qui est conversion est également très simple avec Videomass.

Enfin, seulement si vous êtes sous Mac, car <a href=\"http://numi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Numi</strong></a> ne fonctionne que sur cet OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numi est une calculatrice (en beta) d&rsquo;un nouveau genre qui permet de faire des calculs normaux, de la conversion d&rsquo;unités, du calcul de pourcentage, du calcul de fonctions&#8230;etc.,etc. au travers d&rsquo;une interface minimaliste et simple au possible. Elle permet ainsi de décrire des tâches de manière naturelle et d&rsquo;obtenir instantanément une réponse précise. Par exemple, « 20 $ en euros &#8211; remise de 5 % » ou « aujourd&rsquo;hui + 2 semaines ».</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131895\" width=\"374\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb.webp 746w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb-298x300.webp 298w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Voici quelques unes de ses possibilités : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conversion d&rsquo;unités</strong> : permet de convertir une unité en une autre en utilisant les mots-clés « in », « into », « as » ou « to ». Numi convertira automatiquement les unités pour effectuer les opérations si cela est nécessaire lors de la conversion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Conversion de fuseau horaire</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser la fonction « time » ou « now » pour obtenir l&rsquo;heure dans votre fuseau horaire. Vous pouvez préfixer ces fonctions avec le nom du fuseau horaire (ou utiliser « in » avec un suffixe de fuseau horaire) pour obtenir l&rsquo;heure actuelle pour un lieu spécifié. Les résultats sont toujours synchronisés avec l&rsquo;heure mondiale, donc en tout temps vous obtiendrez l&rsquo;heure exacte. Il est également possible de convertir une heure ou une date spécifique d&rsquo;un fuseau horaire à un autre. Ou calculez la différence entre les heures dans différents fuseaux horaires.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Opérations</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser des opérateurs en signe et en mot. Plusieurs expressions peuvent être empilées ensemble. Notez que les expressions seront multipliées si elles sont utilisées dans des parenthèses les unes après les autres.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nombres</strong> : en plus du système numérique décimal, il est possible d&rsquo;utiliser des nombres en binaire, en octal ou en hexadécimal en utilisant le préfixe approprié : 0b, 0o et 0x. Vous pouvez utiliser les mots-clés « sci » ou « scientific » pour formater les résultats en notation scientifique.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Devises</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser les codes ISO 4217 pour les devises (comme USD, RUB, CAD, etc.). Vous pouvez également utiliser les noms et les symboles des devises courantes, comme le $ pour les dollars américains, les roubles pour les roubles russes ou € pour l&rsquo;euro. Numi met à jour les taux de change plusieurs fois par jour en utilisant le service de taux de change ouvert. Numi prend également en charge une grande liste de cryptomonnaies avec des mises à jour horaires des taux.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pourcentages</strong> : en plus des opérations de pourcentage générales comme l&rsquo;ajout ou la soustraction d&rsquo;un pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur ($10 &#8211; 40%), vous pouvez également utiliser des opérations supplémentaires : pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur, ajout de pourcentage, soustraction de pourcentage, pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre, ajout de pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre, soustraction de pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fonctions</strong> : Numi supporte une large gamme de fonctions mathématiques courantes, y compris les fonctions trigonométriques, exponentielles et logarithmiques. Vous pouvez également utiliser des fonctions d&rsquo;arrondi, de pourboire et de pourcentage de gain/perte.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>En utilisant ces fonctionnalités, Numi vous permet de simplifier vos calculs et de les effectuer rapidement et facilement sur votre Mac. Essayez-la dès maintenant pour voir à quel point elle est rapide, jolie et bien plus agréable que ceci :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img width=\"478\" height=\"315\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2015/07/alc.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1253804088\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p><em>Article rédigé le 6 juillet 2015 et mis à jour le 15 décembre 2022.</em></p>\n",

Moins de 55€ (+TVA)&nbsp;pour 26 mois de protection, et cela <strong>sur un nombre illimité d&rsquo;appareils</strong> ! Difficile de faire mieux, pas encore d&rsquo;inflation chez Surfshark 😉 Et comme toujours vous pouvez encore&nbsp;ajouter une couche de sécu supplémentaire&nbsp;avec le combo alertes +&nbsp;moteur de recherche + l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Antivirus Surfshark</a> (39€ pour les 26 semaines).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"87\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8ik-surfsharknoel\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est le VPN que j&rsquo;utilise personnellement et ce que j&rsquo;apprécie c&rsquo;est que depuis leur lancement (en 2018) ils évoluent sans cesse et plutôt vite. Il y a un mois c&rsquo;était le lancement de <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-nexus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-nexus.html\">Surfshark Nexus</a> par exemple, une fonctionnalité qui permet de stabiliser et améliorer la qualité de sa connexion. En ce mois de décembre, c&rsquo;est au tour du service CleanWeb de subir une refonte et de passer au niveau supérieur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour rappel, l&rsquo;option CleanWeb de base permet de bloquer les publicités et de vous protéger contre les malwares et autres tentatives de phishing. Avec la nouvelle&nbsp;mouture 2.0 les possibilités sont bien supérieures.&nbsp;Cette version n&rsquo;est pour l&rsquo;instant&nbsp;disponible&nbsp;que&nbsp;via&nbsp;les extensions pour navigateurs Firefox, Chrome&nbsp;et Edge. Donc sur Firefox. Les autres n&rsquo;existant pas (bouh j&rsquo;ai fais un troll sur mon site&nbsp;:p).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"320\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/9zgsLDswv632U/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>j&rsquo;en ai fait 2 du coup</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Les options de <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleanWeb 2.0</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Outre une nouvelle version du moteur de blocage des publicités,&nbsp;elle dispose d&rsquo;une personnalisation et d&rsquo;un affinage des blocages pour chacun&nbsp;site visité,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;Cet affinage se fait sur 4 aspects (tous activés par défaut, mais&nbsp;modulable dans les paramètres)&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>le <strong>bloqueur de pubs</strong> : ne se limite plus seulement&nbsp;aux différentes bannières texte/image, il prend aussi en compte les encarts présents dans les vidéos ou sur les plateformes de streaming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>le <strong>bloqueur de pop-up</strong> : va bloquer les ouvertures de fenêtres pop-up, incluant notamment les cookies de consentement/RGPD, etc. Par défaut il va les refuser automatiquement si c&rsquo;est possible, sinon accepter uniquement&nbsp;les cookies&nbsp;obligatoires.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>les <strong>alertes malwares</strong> : vous prévient en cas de téléchargement&nbsp;risqué ou d&rsquo;activité suspicieuse de la page sur laquelle vous êtes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>les <strong>alertes de fuite de données</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131803\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2.jpg 700w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ces dernières sont vraiment intéressantes. Cela vous permet de savoir si les sites que vous visitez ont déjà eu&nbsp;des soucis par le passé. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, il vous fournit un tas d&rsquo;informations :&nbsp;à quelle date,&nbsp;de quelle nature, le nombre de comptes concernés, etc. Pratique, car si l&rsquo;un de ces sites&nbsp;à déjà plusieurs fuites&nbsp;à son actif, peut-être que cela vous fera réfléchir avant d&rsquo;y laisser vos données personnelles. Ou bien la passoire qu&rsquo;il semble être sera tellement énorme que vous bannirez ce site à vie par peur (<em>#coucouFacebook</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez aussi vous servir de ces informations comme d&rsquo;un système de surveillance personnalisé. Si un service que vous utilisez se fait hacker sans que vous soyez au courant, vous verrez une alerte apparaitre dès que Surfshark aura vent du problème. Cela vous amènera sans doute à modifier votre mot de passe au plus vite.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"210\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/EGe7H8HTtw3Cg/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Du coup <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark</a> a décidé de lui donner une vraie place dans son interface avec&nbsp;une section dédiée sur&nbsp;le tableau de bord (c&rsquo;était inclus dans la section VPN auparavant). D&rsquo;ailleurs je le précise pour ceux qui se poseraient la question : <strong>CleanWeb fonctionne même sans être connecté au VPN</strong>, donc en permanence tant que vous utilisez&nbsp;votre navigateur (et que l&rsquo;extension est active, Captain Obvious represent).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore une bonne raison de plus pour se tourner vers Surfshark VPN !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;en profite pour vous rappeler que si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas très chaud pour payer par carte bancaire ou Paypal, le site propose aussi les paiements Google Pay/Amazon Pay et même celui&nbsp;en cryptomonnaies (via les fournisseurs CoinGate et CoinPayments).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Profitez de l&rsquo;offre hivernale à -84% + 2 mois gratuit</a></h2>\n",

Génial non ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous faites partie des dernières 5 personnes au monde à mettre des watermarks sur la photo, c&rsquo;est également possible.

Et cela est possible grâce au script WebOSINT qui une fois en place sur votre machine, ira collecter toutes ces informations, soit directement, soit en utilisant certains services tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour que tout fonctionne correctement avec <a href=\"https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/WebOSINT/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WebOSINT</a>, vous devrez donc vous créer des comptes sur différents services afin de récupérer les clés API. Les clés seront à renseigner dans le fichier config.json.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant l&rsquo;API HackerTarget, pas d&rsquo;obligation puisque vous pouvez utiliser l&rsquo;offre gratuite limitée à quelques requêtes en utilisant l&rsquo;option « -F ». Concernant l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">API WhoisXML</a> ou <a href=\"https://whoisfreaks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhoisFreaks</a>, il vous faudra par contre créer un compte, mais rassurez vous, c&rsquo;est gratuit dans une certaine limite. WhoisXML se limite gratuitement à 500 recherches et WhoisFreaks à 100 recherches gratuites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour installer WebOSINT, ouvrez un terminal et entrez les commandes suivantes : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/webosint\ncd webosint\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\npython3 webosint.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1584905815\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Pensez à bien renseigner les clés API dans le fichier config.json. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois l&rsquo;outil lancé, vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à entrer le nom de domaine et laisser faire la magie de WebOSINT.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131317\" width=\"662\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i.webp 840w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i-300x268.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i-768x686.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Merci à Deuza, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soutien Patreon de renom</a>, pour la découverte.</p>\n",

Elle a sorti un livre d&rsquo;énigmes, il y a quelque temps, en collaboration avec son co-auteur Taharn, intitulé « La Clef » et j&rsquo;avais envie de vous le faire découvrir.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131820\" width=\"610\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8-300x195.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8-768x499.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est un livre unique en son genre (sérieux il n&rsquo;y a pas d&rsquo;équivalent !), qui combine une histoire passionnante et des énigmes complexes à résoudre grâce, notamment, à l&rsquo;utilisation d&rsquo;une lampe UV comme dans les Experts ^^.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai eu la chance de « tester » ce livre et j&rsquo;ai vraiment été impressionnée par la qualité des illustrations qui m&rsquo;ont plongé dans l&rsquo;univers fantastique imaginé par Fanélia, ainsi que par l&rsquo;originalité des énigmes proposées. Enfin, je dis « originalité », mais on encore au-delà de ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le livre s&rsquo;appelle « La Clef » et c&rsquo;est un ouvrage assez costaud, avec une couverture rigide et un papier d’une grande qualité, ce qui le classe dans la catégorie des livres de collection. Offrez-le à un(e) ami(e) geek et il ou elle vous aimera pour la vie ^^. Chaque double page du livre propose ainsi une énigme à résoudre, sans énoncé explicite. Oui, j&rsquo;ai bien dit « sans énoncé », ce qui peut, je vous l’avoue être assez perturbant.&nbsp;En tout cas, moi ça me perturbe ^^.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131815\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Le lecteur devra donc utiliser son sens de l’observation digne d&rsquo;un aigle et sa logique implacable pour trouver la solution en se basant évidemment sur le texte et l&rsquo;image. Le livre comporte 75 énigmes en tout, et certaines d&rsquo;entre elles font référence à d&rsquo;autres pages du livre ou <a href=\"https://www.laclef.online/concept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">même à des sites internet</a>.&nbsp;Vous imaginez le délire ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un Discord est également disponible pour ceux qui souhaitent discuter des énigmes avec d&rsquo;autres lecteurs et avoir un petit coup de pouce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;un des aspects les plus intéressants du livre « La Clef », c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;encre invisible. En utilisant la lampe UV fournie avec le livre, le lecteur peut ainsi découvrir des éléments cachés présents sur certaines pages. Ces indices viennent enrichir l&rsquo;énigme et ajoutent un niveau à la complexité et à l&rsquo;originalité des énigmes. Je vous promets que ça rend l&rsquo;expérience de lecture encore plus immersive et divertissante.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131816\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131817\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Concernant l’univers du livre, je vais tenter de vous résumer ce que j’en ai compris. Ça se passe à Astolie, un monde imaginaire dans un style purement Dark Fantasy et le lecteur peut comme ça, découvrir les différents aspects de la mythologie et de la culture d&rsquo;Astolie en résolvant les énigmes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque énigme est plus originale que la précédente, et certaines font même référence à d&rsquo;autres oeuvres de la littérature, du cinéma ou des jeux vidéo. Cela permet aux fans d&rsquo;énigmes de retrouver des références qu&rsquo;ils connaissent bien, tout en découvrant le nouvel univers tout droit sorti de la tête de nos auteurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je l’ai déjà dit, mais les énigmes sont assez complexes, et elles ne sont pas vraiment destinées aux débutants. Ce n’est pas un livre d’énigmes bas de gamme pour s&rsquo;occuper à la plage comme on peut en trouver parfois… Non, non, elles nécessitent une réflexion approfondie et une capacité à associer des éléments divers et variés pour trouver la solution. Cela en fait le livre parfait pour les amateurs d&rsquo;énigmes expérimentés ou les gens à l&rsquo;esprit acéré, cherchant un défi stimulant et original. Je sais, chacun d&rsquo;entre nous pense qu&rsquo;il a l&rsquo;esprit vif et qu&rsquo;il est plus malin que son voisin&#8230; Je vous rassure, ce livre vous aidera à voir la réalité en face, et ça va faire mal ^^.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131818\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Mon retour sur le bouquin, c’est que je l’adore, mais, la vache, je galère. C’est plus dur qu’un challenge de hacking 😉 en tout cas, je suis loin de l’avoir fini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les fans d&rsquo;univers fantastique ou de Fantasy apprécieront également la qualité des illustrations et l&rsquo;ambiance immersive créée par Fanelia. D’ailleurs, si vous appréciez ses dessins, sachez qu&rsquo;elle vend également ses oeuvres sur son site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour conclure, je dirais que « La Clef » est un bouquin original et passionnant qui mérite d&rsquo;être lu par les amateurs d&rsquo;énigmes et d&rsquo;univers fantastiques n’ayant pas peur de se prendre un peu la tête. Tout est qualitatif dans ce livre et les énigmes + l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;encre invisible, en font un livre à la fois beau et stimulant pour notre petit cerveau tout mou. Ça change !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La complexité des énigmes et la richesse de l&rsquo;univers d&rsquo;Astolie en feront un cadeau idéal pour vos amis ou votre famille, en particulier à l&rsquo;approche de Noël.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131814\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes intéressé, vous pouvez <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BeZiYk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>le commander en ligne</strong></a> ou le trouver dans une librairie spécialisée ou directement <strong><a href=\"https://www.fanelia.art/22-la-clef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sur le site de Fanéli</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.fanelia.art/22-la-clef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>a</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore merci à Fanelia de m’avoir fait découvrir Astolie !</p>\n",

Bref tous ceux qui vendent ou utilisent de la publicité personnalisée. Et malheureusement ces infos finissent toujours par fuiter ou être revendues. GAFAM, application mobile&nbsp;ou petit site e-commerce,&nbsp;pas une semaine ne passe sans que&nbsp;l&rsquo;un de ces&nbsp;services subisse un leak ou un piratage quelconque. Certains sont même créées quasiment juste pour cela, par exemple des applis spéciales pour profiter des offres du Black Friday qui revendent vos données une fois la période terminée.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"426\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/19u-incogni3\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Dans 91.24% des cas (estimation personnelle scientifiquement validée et basée sur mon flair digne de Rantanplan), cela se fait à votre insu. Vous recevez parfois un mail ou un SMS louche pour lequel vous vous demandez comment les gens ont eu vos coordonnées, mais le plus souvent c&rsquo;est flou ou vous l&rsquo;acceptez comme allant de soi. Quoi de plus normal que la publicité ciblée et basée sur nos préférences ? Vous commencez dans les cryptos et n&rsquo;avez encore jamais interagi avec ces services ? Combien de temps avant de recevoir des mails de phishing Metamask &amp; Co ? Pas très longtemps dans la plupart des cas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dès que votre mail, votre numéro de téléphone, votre nom&nbsp;&#8230; est&nbsp;lié à un&nbsp;centre d&rsquo;intérêt particulier vous êtes foutu, ça va tourner dans des dizaines de bases de données chez les data brokers. Vous devez alors leur demander de les retirer. Selon les pays ils sont parfois légalement tenus de le faire, mais même dans ce cas ils traineront des pieds au maximum, car c&rsquo;est leur gagne-pain. Et il faut déjà commencer par les identifier, ce qui n&rsquo;est pas&nbsp;souvent simple à faire. Bonjour les maux de tête.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YpmVBNubONoqs/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"224\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là</a> pour faire le travail à votre place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En utilisant le service, vous allez commencer par lui renseigner les différentes informations que vous voulez faire retirer d&rsquo;Internet. Ensuite Incogni prend tout en charge. Ils vont analyser en continu qui sont les data brokers possédant vos infos et leur demander de les effacer. Pour l&rsquo;instant plus de 145 brokers sont surveillés et la liste s&rsquo;allonge chaque mois (ils n&rsquo;en suivaient que 76 au lancement du produit il y a quelques mois). Si ces derniers ne répondent pas, ils vont les relancer sans arrêt et augmenter la pression jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Et même lorsque c&rsquo;est retiré ils vont continuer à surveiller que cela reste bien le cas. Un peu comme si vous vous mettiez sur liste rouge du web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incogni annonce sauver environ 300 heures de travail. J&rsquo;imagine que c&rsquo;est dans le cas où vous seriez présent sur tous les data brokers qu&rsquo;ils surveillent et je ne peux pas vérifier cette info, mais quand même. Cela en fait du temps gagné et vous suivrez l&rsquo;évolution de la situation via un tableau de bord régulièrement mis à jour. Vous pouvez y voir le nom des sociétés qui détiennent vos informations, ce qu&rsquo;elles en font,&nbsp;où en est la procédure de suppression et parfois à qui elles communiquent leurs données. Voir <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">mon test d&rsquo;Incogni</a> si vous voulez voir à quoi ça ressemble.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En résumé Incogni agit comme un intermédiaire. Ce n&rsquo;est pas qu&rsquo;ils font quelque chose que vous ne pourriez faire vous-mêmes, ils sont plutôt là pour vous faire gagner du temps et que vous n&rsquo;ayez pas à recommencer le travail tous les x mois. Comparé à d&rsquo;autres outils du même genre les tarifs sont plutôt bas puisqu&rsquo;ils sont de l&rsquo;ordre de moins de 5.8€/mois sur l&rsquo;abonnement à l&rsquo;année.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Et puisque ce sont bientôt les fêtes, voici déjà un bon plan qui pourrait vous faire plaisir.&nbsp;Profitez d&rsquo;une<strong> offre à -60 % sur l’abonnement d’un an à Incogni</strong> en ajoutant le code INCOGNI60 lors de votre commande !! Vous avez jusqu&rsquo;au 4 décembre&nbsp;alors ne tardez pas&nbsp;!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez comme plan de disparaitre virtuellement bientôt, c&rsquo;est peut-être un outil qui vous rendra quelques services 😉 Enfin si vous habitez en Europe (inclus l&rsquo;Angleterre), aux USA, en Suisse&nbsp;ou&nbsp;au Canada. Pour les autres pays, ce n&rsquo;est pas encore pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni, efface-moi d&rsquo;Internet stp !</a></h2>\n",

Cela vous permettra de communiquer rapidement et facilement avec vos collaborateurs, vos clients et même les internautes de passage sur votre site web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Très pratique si vous êtes une startup ou une PME qui met à disposition un numéro de téléphone ou qui dispose d&rsquo;un webchat sur son site web pour répondre à toutes les demandes de ses clients. Je pense notamment à tous les e-commerçants ou les startups naissantes qui n&rsquo;ont pas encore les moyens des grosses entreprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est pour cela que 3CX propose une solution de standard téléphonique et de plateforme de messagerie gérée par leurs soins et dans certains cas, hébergée sur vos propres serveurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8874b5-3CX\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"300\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>L&rsquo;offre StartUP Free</strong></a> est donc un bon moyen de découvrir les possibilités de la plateforme de 3CX sans débourser un centime.

Vous accueillez vos clients comme il se doit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, de quoi gérer votre propre petit standard téléphonique gratuitement et surtout facilement, car l&rsquo;interface est vraiment très propre et très claire.

Cela vous permettra d&rsquo;avoir un suivi des conversations avec votre clientèle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque membre du groupe peut également paramétrer ses heures de présence pour que le standard sache où et quand renvoyer les appels. C&rsquo;est plutôt génial d&rsquo;avoir un outil totalement VoIP comme celui-ci qui peut être parfaitement utilisé par les gens en télétravail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>3CX a vraiment fait du très bon travail. Comme je le disais, l&rsquo;outil est simple à prendre en main, même pour le néophyte et chacun peut alors bénéficier d&rsquo;un standard VoIP gratuitement. Les visioconférences et les appels téléphoniques sont parfaitement fluides et d&rsquo;un bon niveau de qualité, mais surtout, ce qui fait la force de 3CX c&rsquo;est vraiment l&rsquo;implémentation de ces technologies (VoIP / WebRTC) dans une suite qui offre toutes les fonctionnalités nécessaires aux petites, moyennes et grandes entreprises qui ont des besoins de communication clientèle. De plus, les fonctionnalités de messagerie que ce soit via WhatsApp ou Livechat, en intégration sur un site web, sont idéales pour recueillir les échanges clients en réduisant les temps d&rsquo;attente et les temps d&rsquo;échange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, c&rsquo;est vraiment un outil à essayer si vous avez besoin de mettre en place un live chat ou un standard téléphonique. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pour vous inscrire, c&rsquo;est par ici</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous avez besoin de documentation, <a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/docs/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">celle-ci se trouve ici</a>.</p>\n",

Seulement voilà, malgré tout l&rsquo;amour que vous portez à Firefox, vous restez quand même conscient que parfois, il peut bouffer un peu *trop* de mémoire.

Alors c&rsquo;est vrai que Windows sait également nettoyer la mémoire, mais il ne le fait pas aussi souvent que Firmin qui lui veille particulièrement sur Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois Firemin lancé, vous choisissez une fréquence de « nettoyage » en millisecondes (par défaut c&rsquo;est 1000 ms), mais les développeurs de Firemin indiquent que les résultats seront meilleurs avec 500 ms. Vous pouvez également spécifier une quantité de mémoire propre à Firefox, à ne pas dépasser (ici 100 MB).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131157\" width=\"433\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp 655w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2-256x300.webp 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Là où c&rsquo;est sympa, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez lui indiquer d&rsquo;autres navigateurs (Chrome, Brave, Edge&#8230;etc.) en cliquant simplement sur le bouton « Parcourir ». J&rsquo;imagine que ça peut fonctionner également avec d&rsquo;autres applications qui ne sont pas des navigateurs, donc à essayer sur vos applications consommatrices de mémoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil doit être lancé en même temps que le navigateur pour fonctionner, donc pensez bien à cocher la case « Démarrer Firemin quand Windows démarre » pour ensuite l&rsquo;oublier.

Mais il y a aussi la stabilité de votre ligne ADSL, de votre Fibre ou de votre connexion 4G/5G qui est importante. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une connexion avec beaucoup de bande passante, c&rsquo;est cool pour regarder une vidéo en ligne ou télécharger un fichier, mais pour des activités moins gourmandes comme la visioconférence ou les jeux vidéos, ce qui compte surtout c&rsquo;est que les réponses à vos requêtes soient rapides et fiables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vos requêtes ne parviennent pas à leur destination, les paquets sont alors perdus et cela peut dégrader votre expérience de jeu par exemple. Sur du FPS, pour être bien il faudrait que le ping soit à minima bien en dessous des 60ms et qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait aucun paquet perdu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même chose pour les visioconférences ou la VoIP, vous devez avoir quelque chose de bon niveau ping et une certaine régularité dans l&rsquo;arrivée de vos paquets TCP pour que la discussion reste compréhensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-991969282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors, comment évaluer ça ? Et bien rendez-vous sur le site <a href=\"https://packetlosstest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Packet Loss Test</a> pour mesurer la fiabilité de votre connexion, et déterminer à la fois la latence, mais également le pourcentage de paquets perdus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131060\" width=\"717\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-300x170.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-768x435.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>De mon côté, je suis plutôt pas mal. Si de votre côté, vous avez beaucoup de paquets perdus, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcément la faute de votre FAI. Jouez avec les réglages du site pour adapter le test à votre bande passante maximale.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"617\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp 617w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw-241x300.webp 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si ça ne change rien, il est fort probable que vous ayez sur votre réseau local, un routeur ou une carte réseau qui se comporte mal. Il faudra alors jouer au jeu du « <em>Je te débranche, je re-teste et je vois si ça va mieux</em>« .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, si rien ne cloche, un petit coup de fil au fournisseur d&rsquo;accès internet. Bon courage avec cette dernière étape.</p>\n",

Ou en français, un courtier en données ?&nbsp;Pas vraiment&nbsp;? Pourtant je suis presque certain que vous en avez forcément rencontré un dans votre vie sur Internet, voire plusieurs. Ils pullulent tellement qu&rsquo;il&nbsp;est aujourd&rsquo;hui presque impossible de conserver son existence en ligne pour soi. Vos informations sont récupérées et exploitées chez eux.&nbsp;Malheureusement, malgré les dangers qu&rsquo;ils représentent pour les gens, physiquement et virtuellement, tout le monde ne les connait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un courtier en données est un <s>parasite</s> organisme qui récolte des informations personnelles sur le maximum d&rsquo;internautes. Ils compilent leurs différentes sources pour créer un profil plus ou moins précis de vous en recoupant ce qu&rsquo;ils trouvent. Cela va de votre email, à votre adresse, vos noms et prénoms, vos possessions, vos informations légales&nbsp;&#8230; voir vos habitudes d&rsquo;achat et votre historique web.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"368\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/xcj-incogni2\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Où vont-ils chercher ces données ? Et bien déjà de tout ce qui est public par défaut (infos perso lorsque vous créez une société &#8230;) ou partagé publiquement par vous-mêmes (réseaux sociaux &#8230;). Ensuite parce que certains services peu scrupuleux&nbsp;sur lesquels vous vous inscrivez n&rsquo;hésitent pas à les&nbsp;revendre (par exemple votre numéro de carte bancaire que vous avez&nbsp;inséré dans un jeu mobile). Plus de 40% des extensions Chrome sont classées comme <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" target=\"_blank\">étant à risque</a>. Enfin&nbsp;depuis des bases de données, des listes de clients, etc. volées, leakées ou revendues par divers hackeurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois qu&rsquo;ils ont recoupé et centralisé toutes leurs sources, ils vont établir des profils thématisés&nbsp;et revendre à leur tour ces informations à des entités commerciales. Vous venez de divorcer ? Vous allez subitement recevoir de la pub en rapport.&nbsp;Une partie des spams que vous recevez dans votre boite mail, ce sont eux. Des SMS non sollicités ? Encore eux. Des coups de fil intempestifs ? Toujours eux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xdnytp8742kg0/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Non seulement c&rsquo;est pénible, mais en plus&nbsp;cela peut être dangereux. Certains sites web centralisent les infos et n&rsquo;hésitent pas à&nbsp;les rendre accessibles à tous. Il suffit alors d&rsquo;une recherche sur votre nom pour connaitre éventuellement votre adresse physique, l&rsquo;endroit ou vous travaillez, quelle voiture vous conduisez, si vous possédez une assurance vie ou non, qui sont les membres de votre famille, etc.&nbsp;Heureusement pour cet aspect « porte ouverte au grand&nbsp;public »&nbsp;nous avons certaines protections en France, <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">notamment le RGPD</a>. Mais aux USA il y a des sites comme PeekYou, WhitePages, etc. qui les partagent. Et c&rsquo;est flippant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du coup l&rsquo;idéal c&rsquo;est de faire supprimer tout ce qui permet de vous identifier chez ces data brokers. Mais comment faire ? Comment identifier ces courtiers ? Et comment savoir qu&rsquo;un courtier détient vos infos ? Enfin, comment lui faire supprimer&nbsp;ce qu&rsquo;il possède sur vous&nbsp;?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"incogni Dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-131464\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-300x100.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ne vous cassez plus le cerveau, <a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là pour vous faciliter la vie</a>. Pour quelques euros par mois, le service de Surfshark va scanner tout le web pour :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>retrouver&nbsp;les brokers qui disposent de vos&nbsp;infos personnelles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>contacter&nbsp;ces courtiers&nbsp;pour leur demander de les supprimer (ce qui est votre droit)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>relancer ces derniers s&rsquo;ils ne se bougent pas assez vite</li>\n\n\n\n<li>effectuer un suivit au fil du temps pour s&rsquo;assurer que vos infos ne sont pas remises en ligne</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Et comme Incogni augmente sans cesse sa liste de brokers sous surveillance, plus le temps passe et plus votre protection augmente. Je vous ai fait un<a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\"> test du service complet </a>il y a quelques semaines, j&rsquo;avais été plutôt étonné de voir le nombre de courtiers qui m&rsquo;avaient sous la main (quasi 100 !). Au moins, filez-moi un billet pour exploiter mes données bande de crevards. Surtout au vu des prix auxquels elles se revendent parfois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6u1Z9pUakUHG6o7oiV/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"303\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref avec Incogni vous allez économiser pas mal de temps, de maux de tête et d&rsquo;énervement lorsque les data brokers ignorerons vos mails. Non, mais qui êtes-vous pour leur retirer le pain de la bouche aussi ? L&rsquo;autre gros avantage du service est de vous présenter un suivit via un tableau de bord très simple à prendre en main. Vous&nbsp;verrez combien de brokers ont vos infos et suivrez en temps réel l&rsquo;avancée du&nbsp;retrait de vos données.&nbsp;Ainsi que&nbsp;le travail de sape d&rsquo;Incogni pour les relancer sans cesse jusqu&rsquo;à ce qu&rsquo;ils obtempèrent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une corde de plus à l&rsquo;arc du respect de la vie privée sur Internet. C&rsquo;est toujours bon à prendre.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Commencez la saison des fêtes avec un peu plus&nbsp;de tranquillité d&rsquo;esprit ! Protégez vos données personnelles&nbsp;et profitez d&rsquo;une réduction de 60 % sur l&rsquo;abonnement d&rsquo;un an à Incogni.

Si vous ne connaissez pas le concept de Serverless, et bien ça va être vite résumé : C&rsquo;est héberger des trucs directement dans le cloud (chez Amazon par exemple), sans avoir ni serveur dédié ni serveur virtualité.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand on est développeur, on peut vite rester bloqué sur les technologies qu&rsquo;on connait par coeur. Toutefois, c&rsquo;est dommage de ne pas continuer à découvrir de nouvelles pratiques ou technologies, car si demain. C&rsquo;est important si vous souhaitez évoluer dans la carrière de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;ailleurs pour ça que le <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>talent club</strong></a> a été crée. Il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;une communauté tech propulsée par talent.io qui donne accès à du contenu exclusif pour vous accompagner professionnellement. En vous inscrivant (<strong>c&rsquo;est gratuit !!</strong>), vous recevrez tous les 15 jours des conseils d&rsquo;expert(e)s de sociétés comme Google, Deezer, Sorabe&#8230;etc. directement dans votre boite mail. Les sujets partagés sont assez variés comme « Comment devenir VP of Engineering », « Comment passer du dev au produit », « Comment obtenir une augmentation », « quelles sont les choses à savoir quand on est le 1er dev d’une start-up », etc..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au sein du talent club, vous aurez aussi accès aux <strong>études de salaires annuelles dans la tech</strong> réalisées par&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\">talent.io</a>&nbsp;et à d&rsquo;autres outils pour gérer votre carrière</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/fuy-serverless-talentio\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"378\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et bien sûr qui dit communauté, dit possibilité de poser des questions à l&rsquo;ensemble des 40 000 inscrits, de manière anonyme. <a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Je vous invite à rejoindre la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenons à notre code et prenons un bout de PHP. Pour le faire fonctionner, vous avez besoin de louer, configurer, et maintenir un serveur. Et évidemment si ce bout de code PHP reçoit beaucoup de trafic, vous devrez aussi augmenter le nombre de serveurs ou libérer des ressources&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serverless, ça permet d&rsquo;éviter cela et donc de réduire les coûts opérationnels, aussi bien en termes d&rsquo;hébergement, que de maintenance&#8230;etc. Et surtout, comme on se repose sur les infrastructures de géants comme Google, Microsoft ou Amazon, ça ne tombe *jamais* en panne et ça peut être scalable (mise à l&rsquo;échelle pour absorber le trafic) très simplement.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est rigolo avec ce concept de serverless, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez y mettre toute votre application web par exemple ou simplement quelques fonctions critiques. Et c&rsquo;est cela dont on va parler aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, je vais vous expliquer comme exécuter une simple fonction écrite en PHP dans le cloud Amazon, en utilisant leur serveur AWS Lambda.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131403\" width=\"645\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-300x81.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-768x206.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Lambda permet d&rsquo;exécuter du code pour n&rsquo;importe quel type d&rsquo;application ou service backend sans avoir à administrer un serveur et en payant uniquement le temps de calcul que vous utilisez. Quand le code n&rsquo;est pas exécuté, vous n&rsquo;êtes pas facturé.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>De quoi a-t-on besoin ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez avoir besoin d&rsquo;un compte chez AWS pour accéder à <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fr/lambda/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lambda</a>.  Nativement avec Lambda, vous pouvez créer des fonctions nodejs, python, go&#8230;etc. Mais pas PHP, en tout cas, pas avec les outils fournis au niveau de la console d&rsquo;administration d&rsquo;AWS Lambda</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131404\" width=\"695\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-300x97.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-768x249.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Donc pour contourner le souci, on va utiliser un framework Composer qui s&rsquo;appelle <a href=\"http://bref.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bref</strong></a> et qui permet de faire tourner du PHP en Serverless sans se prendre la tête. C&rsquo;est top pour des jobs cron, des API ou des petits sites web dont les assets sont servis par Amazon S3. Par contre pour des applications complètes en PHP, ce sera un peu plus complexe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On passe à l&rsquo;installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Première étape : <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Installer Composer</a> sur votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>brew install composer</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez également <a href=\"https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">avoir besoin de npm</a> : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>brew install npm</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, vous allez devoir installer le framework Serverless dont Bref a besoin pour fonctionner. Cela lui permet d&rsquo;assurer la connexion avec AWS.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install -g serverless</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Droits utilisateur AWS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Côté AWS, vous allez avoir besoin de clés d&rsquo;accès. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\">Ça se passe par ici</a>.

Mais avec un petit fond sonore, c&rsquo;est mieux !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais on ne peut pas diffuser n&rsquo;importe quelle musique sur Twitch car sinon, ces derniers coupent le son pour des questions de droits d&rsquo;auteur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc passé par le site Chillhop qui propose des morceaux Lo-Fi / Chill parfaits pour faire un fond sonore sympa dans mon stream. Pour intégrer leur musique, j&rsquo;avais alors 2 possibilités : Streamer leur playlist via Spotify ou streamer leur live YouTube, directement depuis OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotify, je m&rsquo;en sers pour écouter ma musique copyrightée toute la journée donc je ne pouvais pas le dédier à ça. J&rsquo;ai donc créé une source browser chargeant une page HTML de mon cru permettant de jouer la playlist Chillhop en auto play.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"lofi hip hop radio - beats to study/relax to 🐾\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NOSDKb0HlU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-889942282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;était cool et ça fonctionnait bien. Jusqu&rsquo;au jour où Chillhop (ou YouTube) a bloqué l&rsquo;autoplay sur ses Lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus de musique de fond sur mes streams. J&rsquo;étais tristesse. Puis au bout d&rsquo;un moment, mes millions de viewers ont commencé à me réclamer de la musique en fond sonore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;écoutant que mon abnégation à leur égard, j&rsquo;ai donc décidé de trouver la parade pour streamer un live YouTube dans OBS. Je vais vous détailler tout ça, étape par étape. Pensez bien à envoyer l&rsquo;URL de cet article à votre streamer ou streameuse préférée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc parti (grâce aux conseils de ma communauté) sur l&rsquo;option VLC qui permet de tout faire et surtout de lire une vidéo YouTube directement depuis le player comme ceci (je suis sous macOS, mais pour Windows ou Linux, c&rsquo;est le même principe) :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais, il y a une source VLC dans OBS, mais je n&rsquo;ai jamais réussi à la faire fonctionner correctement. Donc je suis parti sur VLC, mais chargé à l&rsquo;extérieur d&rsquo;OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sauf que je n’ai pas besoin de la vidéo, mais uniquement du son. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté ce paramètre :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' <strong>--no-video</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1656088500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>À ce moment-là, le logiciel que j&rsquo;utilise pour ma table de mixage (<a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loopback</a>) n&rsquo;est pas encore compatible avec la dernière version de macOS. Je ne pouvais donc pas récupérer le son provenant de VLC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131001\" width=\"692\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-300x111.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-768x284.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il fallait donc que je me débrouille sans ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc entrepris de créer toujours avec VLC, un streaming du live YouTube de Chillhop, qui serait accessible via l&rsquo;URL http://localhost:2323 que je pourrais alors charger dans une source « Media Source » dans OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ca donne donc ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video <strong>--sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; comme dirait le chef Michel Dumas. Je peux alors créer ma nouvelle Media Source dans OBS et avoir le son de Chillhop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131002\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-768x560.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais il y a deux problème à cette ligne de commande : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Il faut que je pense à la lancer avant de démarrer mon live. E</li><li>t quand je la lance, ça démarre VLC qui est alors visible comme ceci :</li></ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131003\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8-300x166.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8-768x424.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-2014473609\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_4' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_4\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos4' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos4\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;est moche et si par réflexe, je ferme le terminal ou VLC, ça coupe la musique. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors pour masquer l&rsquo;interface de VLC, il suffit de le lancer avec ce paramètre : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>-I http</strong> 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toutefois, penser à le lancer à chaque fois, c&rsquo;est relou. C&rsquo;est là que j&rsquo;ai appris l&rsquo;existence des scripts dans OBS. En effet, on peut coder des scripts pour interagir avec OBS, soit en Python, soit en LUA. Je suis fan de Python donc je me dis que ça va être vite torché, mais malheureusement, j&rsquo;ai eu beau spécifier le bon interpréteur Python dans OBS, impossible de faire tourner le moindre script Python. Même un hello world ça ne fonctionnait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je ne pouvais pas non plus y passer des heures, donc je me suis rabattu sur le LUA. J&rsquo;ai donc pondu ce script en LUA pour appeler ma ligne de commande VLC. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est plusieurs centaines de lignes de code ultra complexes. Non, je déconne, c&rsquo;est juste une ligne de merde : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>-- Script LUA pour charger la musique de Chillhop dans OBS - https://korben.info\n\n<strong>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'\")</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai sauvegardé ce script en le nommant chillhop.lua, puis je me suis rendu dans OBS, menu « Tools » &gt; « Scripts » et j&rsquo;ai simplement ajouté mon script Lua dedans :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131004\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-300x214.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-768x548.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1293277903\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_5' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_5\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos5' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos5\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai relancé OBS et là, je me suis rendu compte que ça freezait tout mon OBS. En effet, en se chargeant, VLC bloque la suite du chargement de l&rsquo;application. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté un petit &amp; à la fin de la commande pour que OBS reprenne immédiatement la main et n&rsquo;attende pas comme un con que VLC ait terminé.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}' <strong>&amp;</strong> \")</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ça fonctionne. OBS démarre, exécute le script LUA qui à son tour lance VLC en arrière plan pour lire la musique et OBS peut alors récupérer dans sa Media Source le son diffusé via l&rsquo;adresse localhost. C&rsquo;est transparent et rapide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est cool avec tout ça, c&rsquo;est que ça ouvre un monde de possibilité pour augmenter et piloter OBS tout en script. C&rsquo;est donc à creuser. Il ne me manque plus que les bonnes idées maintenant.</p>\n",

Mais si c&rsquo;est le cas, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il y a de nombreuses bonnes raisons de le faire. Régulièrement cités <strong>parmi les services VPN les plus&nbsp;fiables</strong>, ils sont aussi&nbsp;plutôt novateurs et proposent des options qui deviennent régulièrement des standards.&nbsp;L&rsquo;une des dernières en date étant <strong>l&rsquo;innovation Nexus</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusivité Surfshark, <strong>Nexus</strong> permet de connecter l&rsquo;ensemble du parc de serveurs (+ de 3200) en un seul réseau qui couvre quasiment la planète entière. Le premier bénéfice étant de rendre votre <strong>connexion plus stable et rapide</strong>. Finis d&rsquo;être connecté à un serveur unique dont les performances vont&nbsp;être dégradées s&rsquo;il est surchargé. Par effet cascade le second avantage est donc d&rsquo;améliorer&nbsp;votre confidentialité. Puisque les informations transitent via plusieurs serveurs, cela fragmente la&nbsp;surveillance possible et renforce donc votre protection. Cette nouveauté sera déployée totalement d&rsquo;ici fin 2023.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"418\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/gds-surfshark4\" alt=\"Surfshark Nexus\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En attendant vous bénéficiez toujours des fonctionnalités déjà présentes :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>chiffrement de bout en bout (algo AES 256 GCM)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utilisation de protocoles sécurisés (WireGuard, IKv2/IPsec &#8230;)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>mode camouflage (cache à votre FAI que vous utilisez un VPN)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bouton kill switch (empêche vos données de fuiter lors d&rsquo;une déconnexion sauvage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>le split tunneling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>la protection lorsque vous vous connectez à un Wi-Fi public</li>\n\n\n\n<li>rotation d&rsquo;IP (sans déconnexion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>pas de conservations des logs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>blocage des pubs, cookies et autres malwares</li>\n\n\n\n<li></li>\n\n\n\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres nouveautés sont encore prévues dans les prochains mois, parce qu&rsquo;on peut toujours faire mieux. Comme par exemple la <strong>génération automatique d&rsquo;une nouvelle adresse IP</strong> pour chaque site que vous visitez (sans devoir déconnecter/reconnecter l&rsquo;outil).&nbsp;Si la&nbsp;<strong>fonction MultiHop</strong> est déjà disponible (elle permet de mettre un serveur supplémentaire entre vous et le&nbsp;site auquel vous vous connectez), elle&nbsp;disposera bientôt d&rsquo;une option pour l&rsquo;automatiser dans certains cas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"250\" height=\"141\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/krM6ANSNvFg52/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Exemple de MultiHop automatique</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous voulez tester le service pour pas cher ?

Pour 26 mois cela ne vous reviendra même pas à&nbsp;54€ au total, hors TVA, soit 84% de rabais. Ce qui fait toujours&nbsp;bien plaisir&nbsp;en pleine période d&rsquo;inflation. Un prix quasi&nbsp;imbattable pour un VPN de ce calibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes du genre à passer pas mal de commandes sur différents e-commerces, vous pourrez récupérer cette somme assez facilement. Comme vous le savez, les prix de certains produits, des billets d&rsquo;avions ou de trains, d&rsquo;un service de location &#8230; sont parfois dépendants de votre lieu de connexion. Avec Surfshark il suffit de tester depuis différents&nbsp;pays&nbsp;pour comparer les tarifs et prendre le plus intéressant pour vous. Et avec des serveurs dans plus de 100 localisations, il y a de quoi faire des tests et des comparaisons (sortez votre tableur Excel ;)).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l1IY5NRhxdCJYxsmA/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez même partager le prix de l&rsquo;abonnement&nbsp;avec plusieurs membres de la famille puisque le nombre d&rsquo;appareils supportés est illimité ! Votre enfant n&rsquo;a que 8 ans ? Pas d&rsquo;excuses, il faut lui apprendre les dures réalités économiques. S&rsquo;il veut continuer à regarder Adibou ou Pokémon, faut raquer ;p. Alors que d&rsquo;autres solutions vont (parfois) jusqu&rsquo;à 10 ou 12 appareils, Surfshark vous permet de protéger absolument tout et tout le monde. L&rsquo;ordinateur fixe,&nbsp;les 2 laptops, les 4 téléphones portables, la console de salon, le routeur&nbsp;et les équipements de la maison (Smart TV &amp; Co) &#8230; tout sera pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et surtout, en plus d&rsquo;être très abordable, Surfshark est&nbsp;un VPN parmi les plus fiables actuellement sur le marché.

Dispo dans le jeu <a href=\"https://returntomonkeyisland.com/the-story-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mais aussi en ligne</a>, c&rsquo;est mignon, rigolo, et bien pensé !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui frappe en premier lieu, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;univers graphique, très différent de ce qu&rsquo;on a pu voir auparavant. Faut dire que chaque jeu propose un style artistique unique, et celui-ci ne fait pas exception à la règle. Mais lorsque le jeu fut annoncé et les premières images dévoilées, nombre de trolls se sont indignés (à tel point que Ron Gilbert a cessé toute communication). J&rsquo;étais sceptique mais une fois dans le jeu, franchement, à part quelques points particuliers, c&rsquo;est magnifique. Tout est très lisible, coloré, détaillé, super bien animé…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131344\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajoutez à cela un habillage sonore enchanteur avec d&rsquo;excellentes musiques, et on est embarqué direct dans l&rsquo;ambiance ! On retrouve le thème principal de la série, évidemment, mais pas que. 😉 Les arrangements sont super réussis, j&rsquo;ai adoré !</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1488330414\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Enfin bref, on est là pour vivre une aventure de pirates et résoudre plein d&rsquo;énigmes. Qu&rsquo;en est-il de ce côté là ? Eh bien, je suis désolé pour le manque de suspense mais c&rsquo;est encore une réussite. 🦜 L&rsquo;interface est bien foutue, accessible et ergonomique. Il y a un mode « facile » pour les personnes qui ne connaissent pas trop ce genre de jeu, c&rsquo;est une bonne idée mais attention, ça enlève certaines énigmes et donc certaines parties de l&rsquo;histoire. Je conseille de jouer en mode « difficile ».</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131341\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est vraiment très bien écrite, c&rsquo;est super drôle et prenant. Le rythme énigmes / dialogues / découverte de nouveaux lieux m&rsquo;a semblé équilibré, avec toujours une certaine liberté dans l&rsquo;ordre d&rsquo;appréhender les choses. On est jamais totalement coincé devant un truc sans savoir quoi faire, on peut toujours aller voir ailleurs et avancer d&rsquo;une manière ou d&rsquo;une autre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au pire, y a un système d&rsquo;aide intégré au jeu, qui donne quelques indices sans jamais dévoiler la solution. Vraiment mieux que d&rsquo;aller chercher la <em>soluce</em> sur le web, c&rsquo;est bien dosé, vraiment nickel !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131342\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On sent l&rsquo;attention porté à chaque détail, et ce, sur chaque aspect. Les nouveaux venus sont accueillis aux petits soins, et les vieux de la vieille apprécieront les multiples références faites aux anciens jeux. Je pense que chacun peut y trouver son compte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non franchement j&rsquo;ai été conquis de bout en bout, pour les plus radins le jeu est actuellement disponible sur le Xbox Gamepass, mais vous pourrez aussi le trouver sur <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steam</a> (compatible Windows, Mac et Linux), <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/return-to-monkey-island-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/fr-fr/concept/10006133/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/fr-FR/games/store/return-to-monkey-island/9pc4r8n1n2t6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox Series X/S</a>&#8230; Pour moins de 25€ je ne peux que vous le conseiller !</p>\n",

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Les éditos sont faits pour ça 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-522601528\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai bien sûr repris les <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch les lundi, mardi et jeudi après-midi</a> et je dois dire qu&rsquo;on rigole bien. Comme d&rsquo;hab, je papote avec les followers, j&rsquo;écris mes articles et je bidouille des trucs. Après si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas dispo à ces heures là, y&rsquo;a évidemment les replays. Côté TikTok, ça commence a devenir également sérieux puisque j&rsquo;ai atteint <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@korbeninfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">un nombre conséquent d&rsquo;abonnés</a>. Ça ne rigole plus 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;ailleurs demain même si c&rsquo;est férié, ça va être tournage de vidéos. C&rsquo;est amusant à faire, donc c&rsquo;est que du plaisir, je vous rassure 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour les news. L&rsquo;hiver est enfin là, donc le mood est au feu de cheminée, au chocolat chaud et bientôt à la raclette ^^. Noël arrive, faut bien commencer à se mettre dans l&rsquo;ambiance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon et vous ça va ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tchuss !</p>\n",

Mais est-ce la seule chose que vous pouvez faire ? Bien sûr que non. Et aujourd&rsquo;hui je vais vous proposer <strong>quelques actions quotidiennes</strong> que vous pouvez mettre en place pour vous protéger sur le long terme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avant de commencer, j&rsquo;insiste juste sur le fait que chaque jour lorsque vous surfez sur le web, que vous utilisez des applications, etc. vos données sont récupérées. C&rsquo;est comme ça. Et même par des services fiables cela peut créer des problèmes. Ils peuvent se faire hacker leur base de données, des employés peuvent les revendre en soum soum ou la société peut décider de faire un rab de&nbsp;moula en la revendant une fois qu&rsquo;elle a fermé ses portes. Bref tout atterrit <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chez des data brokers qui collectent toutes ces infos</a></strong> et les revendent à prix d&rsquo;or. Parfois ces data brokers rachètent même des sites en perdition, juste pour disposer de la collecte de données qui a été réalisée (à des fins légitimes) pendant des années.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et même sans ça, vos données personnelles se retrouvent parfois disponibles en toute connaissance de cause. Par exemple sur des sites de fiches d&rsquo;entreprise lorsque vous créez une société, ou dans les fichiers PDF d&rsquo;un listing de diplômés d&rsquo;une école, de chercheurs dans une étude, etc.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"317\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/h55EUEsTG9224/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref nous sommes <strong>tous et toutes&nbsp;les vaches à lait de cette industrie</strong>. De manière directe&nbsp;ou au moins via les personnalités que nous nous créons en ligne (qui finissent par nous ressembler au final). Et s&rsquo;il est difficile de supprimer à 100% toutes nos traces numériques (surtout que la plupart du temps nous ne sommes même pas conscients d&rsquo;où elles circulent), il existe quelques possibilités pour limiter notre exposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1) Ne créez pas de compte si ce n&rsquo;est pas nécessaire</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon je sais, vous allez me dire que c&rsquo;est obvious. Je sais que ce n&rsquo;est pas votre cas, mes lecteurs adorés ont un QI supérieur à la moyenne. Mais qui ne connait pas une personne qui&nbsp;s&rsquo;ouvre un compte sur&nbsp;un e-commerce quelconque&nbsp;pour commander un objet pas cher et va ensuite laisser son compte existant pendant des années ? Peut-être qu&rsquo;en se demandant au départ si l&rsquo;objet en question est vraiment utile, le compte n&rsquo;aurait jamais eu besoin d&rsquo;être créé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"358\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPOqmCwBBEVPBOFYQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Est-ce qu&rsquo;ouvrir un 4e compte Instagram pour publier uniquement les photos&nbsp;de la tortue de compagnie&nbsp;est vraiment utile ? À vous de voir. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, passez au point suivant lorsqu&rsquo;il ne vous est plus d&rsquo;aucune utilité. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans le même esprit, ne donnez pas votre téléphone sans raison. Aussi bien dans les applis mobiles que dans les magasins physiques (si on vous les demande parfois ce n&rsquo;est que dans un seul but : vous balancer de la pub).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2) Fermer et supprimer vos comptes inutilisés</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais que vous avez déjà pensé à ce point. Mais êtes-vous vraiment un bon élève ? Vous êtes certain qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas un petit compte non utilisé depuis 2 ans et que vous gardez parce que la flemme de retrouver le mot de passe ? Ou parce qu&rsquo;on ne sait jamais, vous pourriez en avoir besoin un jour ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La question de la vie privée était beaucoup moins présente il y a 10 ans. Combien ont toujours des infos (ne serait-ce que l&#8217;email) sur des sites abandonnés comme MySpace, Flickr, StumbleUpon ou que sais-je&nbsp;? À partir du moment où votre adresse mail est quelque part, elle pourra servir à des gens pour vous bombarder de spams (selon les estimations 97% des adresses mail en reçoivent).&nbsp;Pire, imaginez qu&rsquo;il y a&nbsp;10 ans vous aviez un Skyblog&nbsp;avec une photo gênante et que l&rsquo;on parvienne à recouper l&rsquo;info avec votre adresse mail toujours active aujourd&rsquo;hui ?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2Kgm3KOBUE6wF2/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est parfois bien caché dans les options, il faut parfois envoyer un mail personnalisé, etc., mais prenez le temps de le faire.&nbsp;Vous pouvez vous aider d&rsquo;un site comme <a href=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Just Delete Me</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combien recevez-vous de communications commerciales que vous ne lisez jamais ? Est-ce que toutes les newsletters que vous recevez sont vraiment importantes ? Etc. Je suis sûr qu&rsquo;il y a moyen de limiter ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3) Renforcez la&nbsp;vie privée sur les réseaux sociaux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Là encore ça semble logique, mais beaucoup ne prennent pas le temps d&rsquo;effectuer les quelques clics nécessaires. Surtout que les réseaux sont sans doute LA source de récolte numéro 1 à l&rsquo;heure actuelle. Lorsque vous partagez votre localisation, balancez une photo d&rsquo;un endroit que vous visitez, parlez sans arrêt avec une même personne, etc. il n&rsquo;est pas très compliqué pour les algorithmes de vite se faire une&nbsp;image assez précise de vous, de vos préférences&nbsp;et de qui sont vos proches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;autant plus le cas lorsque vous connectez les services entre-eux (en vous connectant à des sites tiers avec vos identifiants Google ou&nbsp;Facebook par exemple), là ce sont tous les&nbsp;services interconnectés&nbsp;qui peuvent accéder à vos données. Les réseaux sociaux tirent littéralement leurs bénéfices des publicités ciblées. Et pour en tirer le meilleur afin que leurs pubs soient les plus&nbsp;rentables possibles ? Il leur faut accéder au max de vos infos, bingo.&nbsp;Donc les paramètres de protections par défaut sont (trop) souvent&nbsp;permissifs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/KPEpqHiJVrSVCOjyCP/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>À vous de limiter tout ça : ne pas laisser&nbsp;votre profil visible publiquement, retirer la géolocalisation,&nbsp;limiter qui a le droit de voir quoi, ne pas accepter la publicité ciblée, refuser les contenus supplémentaires, faire attention lorsque vous prenez des gens ou des lieux en photo, ne pas interconnecter les services, limiter au maximum les extensions, etc. Il y a quelques semaines&nbsp; je vous ai fait un petit guide&nbsp;pour <a href=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\">disparaitre de Google</a>, ça pourrait vous servir.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est pas non plus une mauvaise idée de supprimer vos anciens posts/tweets/photos, etc. s&rsquo;ils n&rsquo;ont plus rien à faire dans votre profil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4) Utilisez un navigateur web respectueux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Désinstallez Google Chrome, Microsoft&nbsp;Edge, Apple Safari&nbsp;&amp; Co. Privilégiez Brave, Firefox ou Tor Browser qui sont les 3 navigateurs les plus sécurisés à ce niveau. Laissez-les faire le plus gros du travail de prévention, ils bloquent par défaut de nombreux traqueurs, les profils comportementaux, etc. Pour Tor il faut quand même mentionner que certains FAI (si pas tous) vont vous brider le débit dès qu&rsquo;ils se rendront compte que vous l&rsquo;utilisez. Mais, quel que soit celui que vous choisissez, continuer à limiter le nombre d&rsquo;extensions installées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"324\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YsZBbMUeDLFNjQTtjz/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous voulez voir ce qui transparait avec votre navigateur actuel, il existe des sites <a href=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comme celui-ci</a>. Après sachez que même avec un bon navigateur, même avec un VPN, même avec Tor, etc. vous laisserez des bouts de&nbsp;traces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5) Retrouvez et faites supprimer vos infos chez les data brokers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant que vous avez limité au mieux la future&nbsp;récolte de vos données, comment faire pour celles qui trainent déjà sur la toile ? Il faudrait pouvoir retrouver tous les data brokers qui disposent de ces données, cela éviterait qu&rsquo;ils puissent continuer à les revendre. Si certains sont très connus (Spokeo, WhitePages &#8230;) pour d&rsquo;autres, il est très compliqué de remonter jusqu&rsquo;à eux. Si vous recevez un email de scam, un coup de fil marketing, etc. comment savoir d&rsquo;où ces gens ont&nbsp;obtenu vos infos ? Et lorsque vous avez fait ce travail digne de l&rsquo;inspecteur Derrick il faut encore obtenir du data broker qu&rsquo;il supprime ce qui doit l&rsquo;être. Multipliez cela par des dizaines de brokers et vous pouvez faire une croix sur vos soirées pour les 3 prochains mois.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est là qu&rsquo;intervient un service <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">comme Incogni</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"422\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/9u2-incogni1\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il vont faire le gros du travail pour vous. Déjà en répertoriant chez quels data brokers vos données personnelles se retrouvent, ensuite en les contactant à votre place&nbsp;pour qu&rsquo;ils&nbsp;suppriment ces données&nbsp;et ensuite en faisant un suivit pour s&rsquo;assurer qu&rsquo;elles ne réapparaissent pas dans les prochaines années. Et si les brokers ne répondent pas aux demandes, Incogni va les relancer jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Qu&rsquo;ils soient contactés par un service dont c&rsquo;est la spécialité ou par le mail dindon63@gmail.com de Mr Machin , ça risque de faire&nbsp;une différence 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez pas mal bourlingué sur le web depuis de nombreuses années et avec une identité&nbsp;figée (même adresse mail, même numéro de téléphone, mêmes services utilisés &#8230;), votre profil doit être assez précis et répandu. Pour moins de 6€/mois, la solution Incogni fera le nécessaire et vous tiendra au courant étape par étape via son tableau de bord. J&rsquo;ai d&rsquo;ailleurs <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">testé Incogni en détail</a> pour vous montrer comment cela se passe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"414\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer un peu tout ça, il faut avoir une bonne hygiène numérique au quotidien. Et lorsque les choses ont pris une certaine ampleur (ou que l&rsquo;on prend seulement conscience de l&rsquo;importance de faire respecter sa vie privée) il y a des services comme Incogni pour nous épauler. Bref nous ne sommes pas sans ressources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">Découvrez Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Et le fait de pouvoir intégrer ça dans vos scripts peut vous permettre d&rsquo;ajouter certaines fonctions sympas relatives à la compréhension / taggage d&rsquo;une image ou tout simplement à la génération d&rsquo;avatars ou d&rsquo;images diverses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici.</a></p>\n",

Donc si vous avez un NAS par exemple, et bien vous ne pourrez pas le stocker chez eux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À moins de prendre leur abonnement B2 qui offre un stockage pur et dur sans logiciel client.

Le concept est simple : pour avoir des sauvegardes efficaces et sérieuses, vous devez réaliser : </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 sauvegardes. 2 de ces sauvegardes sont stockées sur des supports différents (par exemple, un disque externe + un NAS) et la 3e sauvegarde doit être conservée hors site (donc pas chez vous). Cela peut être sur le cloud ou chez Tata Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée c&rsquo;est que si un incendie se déclare chez vous parce que vous avez chauffé votre maison avec vos meubles à cause de Bruno Lemaire, et bien même si toute votre famille a brulé, au moins, vous avez un backup de vos épisodes de Naruto.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130921\" width=\"494\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-300x122.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-768x312.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment pour gagner du temps, vous pouvez faire partir les 2 premiers backups (locaux) depuis votre ordinateur et le dernier off-site depuis votre NAS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour revenir à Backblaze en cas de souci, vous pourrez alors récupérer vos données soit en les téléchargeant directement depuis leur site, soit en vous faisant livrer un disque dur contenant vos données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors, maintenant comment faire pour sauvegarder TOUT votre NAS vers Backblaze alors que les disques réseau ne sont pas supportés dans leur application cliente ?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1681548937\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Et bien c&rsquo;est simple, il faut gruger un peu et faire croire à l&rsquo;outil que les répertoires réseau que vous voulez envoyer là-bas sont des répertoires locaux. Et pour cela, 2 façons de faire en fonction de votre OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes sous Windows, il vous faudra utiliser le logiciel libre <a href=\"http://dokan-dev.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dokany</a> qui permet de monter des systèmes de fichiers divers et variés (disque externe, disque réseau&#8230;etc.) pour les intégrer dans votre système de fichier actuel afin que toutes vos applications Windows puissent y accéder en toute transparence.

Et celui-ci est payant, car les gens qui utilisent des logiciels Apple ont de la grosse moula évidemment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il vous faudra donc vous offrir le logiciel <a href=\"https://automounter.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AutoMounter</a> pour la modique somme de 17 $ afin de monter vos disques distants un peu n&rsquo;importe où sur votre système macOS.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130923\" width=\"382\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp 653w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg-255x300.webp 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ce n&rsquo;est pas plus compliqué que ça. Et évidemment, les sauvegardes se feront de manière fluide, avec le client Windows ou MacOS <a href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00wmi7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backblaze</a> dans le cadre de votre forfait Personal Backup.</p>\n",

Mais voici quand même un exemple. Imaginons que dans votre dossier Downloads, vous ayez des tas de PDF que vous voulez déplacer dans un sous-dossier PDF ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lancez l&rsquo;édition de la config d&rsquo;Organize et scriptez comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># organize configuration file\n# https://organize.readthedocs.io\nrules:\n  - name: \"Find PDFs\"\n    locations:\n      - ~/Downloads\n    subfolders: true\n    filters:\n      - extension: pdf\n    actions:\n      - echo: \"Found PDF!\"\n      - move: ~/Downloads/PDFs/\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130867\" width=\"750\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp 821w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-300x281.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-768x718.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, une règle se compose : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>D&rsquo;un nom (name) (Vous mettre ce que vous voulez)</li><li>D&rsquo;un ou plusieurs emplacements (locations)</li><li>D&rsquo;actions (actions) pour afficher des messages ou agir sur les fichiers</li><li>Et d&rsquo;un tas d&rsquo;autres paramètres comme le parcours des sous dossiers, le filtrage des fichiers par extension&#8230;etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1876307667\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Cet exemple n&rsquo;est pas exhaustif. Il est par exemple possible de désactiver une règle en passant à « false » le paramètre « enabled ». Les filtres sont également intéressant car ils permettent de débusquer les fichiers selon la structure de leur nom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il y a vraiment beaucoup de paramètres qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans chacune de vos règles donc je vous invite encore une fois à vous pencher sur la doc. Si par malheur, Organize rencontre des conflits de fichiers, l&rsquo;outil dispose également d&rsquo;options pour résoudre cela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les données Exif peuvent également être extraites des fichiers pour ensuite être utilisées à votre convenance et l&rsquo;outil est capable d&rsquo;extraire du contenu de PDFs ou de fichiers DOCX&#8230;etc our mieux les catégoriser. C&rsquo;est hyper puissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un mode « simulation » permet également de tester vos règles sans risque afin d&rsquo;éviter de massacrer vos fichiers en cas d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un outil formidable qui en fait beaucoup. L&rsquo;essayer c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;adopter !</p>\n",

Très logiquement ces « soldes » avant l&rsquo;heure&nbsp;se sont propagées au web et&nbsp;sont souvent l&rsquo;occasion pour les boites Tech de proposer des tarifs intéressants, avec en tête de liste les VPNs. <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Cette année la promo Black Friday de Surfshark a lieu du 27 octobre au 27 novembre 2022</strong>.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/4kn-blackfriday-surfshark\" alt=\"Interface Surfshark\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a>, partenaire de longue date de korben.info (merci à eux !), ne déroge pas à la règle et vous propose chaque année des prix vraiment bluffants et qui valent le détour.&nbsp;Cette année par exemple vous pourrez bénéficier d&rsquo;un <strong>tarif de 2.05 $ par mois</strong> (soit environ 2.05 €) <strong><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sur un abonnement de 2 ans</a></strong> (24 mois) avec 2 mois offerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je n&rsquo;ai aucun mal à vous recommander Surfshark en tant que solution VPN à utiliser. Pas parce qu&rsquo;ils sont partenaires, mais parce que la boite est l&rsquo;une des plus sérieuses depuis son lancement en 2018. Et ne prenez pas mon avis comme argent comptant, je ne suis pas le seul à le dire. Encore dernièrement ils ont par exemple été récompensés&nbsp;lors de la <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://cybersecuritybreakthrough.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://cybersecuritybreakthrough.com/\" target=\"_blank\">6e CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards</a> grâce à leur solution <a href=\"https://surfshark.com/fr/surfshark-nexus-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nexus</a>, reconnue comme étant la meilleure solution VPN du marché.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark Black Friday 2022\" class=\"wp-image-131111\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022-300x91.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Toute la boite à outils pour protéger votre vie privée en ligne est bien entendu toujours présente.

Cela inclus de :&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cacher&nbsp;votre adresse IP</a> (+ rotation régulière)</li><li>ne pas conserver&nbsp;de traces de votre activité en ligne</li><li>contourner la censure et les contenus géolimités</li><li>chiffrer vos informations de bout en bout (algo AES-256-GCM)</li><li>protection de votre identité</li><li>bloquer les publicités, cookies &amp; co</li><li>se protéger des logiciels malveillants</li><li>protéger vos connexions sur les Wi-Fi publics</li><li>fonctionnalité Bypasser (leur fonction de&nbsp;split tunneling)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Toutes les fonctionnalités classiques sont de la partie. Et parmi les dernières nouveautés&nbsp;du service, on note qu&rsquo;ils ont dorénavant&nbsp;un parc de plus de 3200&nbsp;serveurs <strong>répartis dans plus de 100 pays différents</strong> ! Les nouveaux pays sont le Ghana, l&rsquo;Arabie Saoudite et Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;interface pour Linux (souvent le parent pauvre des OS) a récemment été retravaillée pour&nbsp;plus de lisibilité&nbsp;et voit l&rsquo;ajout d&rsquo;un bouton Kill Switch plutôt pratique. <strong>Le mode camouflage</strong> est, lui aussi, toujours de la partie. Pour rappel c&rsquo;est un mode assez sympa qui permet de cacher même à votre fournisseur d&rsquo;accès Internet que vous utiliser un VPN.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark dans 100 pays\" class=\"wp-image-131115\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark-300x147.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption><em>source : blog Surfshark</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cerise sur la tarte le nombre d&rsquo;appareils qui peuvent être connectés sur un compte est &#8230; illimité.&nbsp;Ordinateur fixe/portable, téléphones perso et pro, téléviseur intelligent,&nbsp;Google Home ou Alexa, routeur&nbsp;&#8230; tout est couvert ! Que ces appareils tournent sur Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, s&rsquo;utilisent via un navigateur web&nbsp;ou via une console (Xbox ou PlayStation) n&rsquo;est pas un souci.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais si vous voulez jeter un oeil du côté des options payantes (et facultatives) il y a aussi de quoi faire. Un moteur de recherche (<em>Surfshark Search</em>)&nbsp;qui vous permet d&rsquo;obtenir des résultats non traqués et impartiaux (pas des résultats faussés par votre historique et vos recherches précédentes). Un système de surveillance (<em>Surfshark Alerts</em>)&nbsp;qui permet&nbsp;d&rsquo;être alerté si certaines de vos informations personnelles sont divulguées. Ou encore un antivirus (plus de détails dans mon article <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Antivirus Surfshark</a>). Le pack des 3 est dispo pour 1.5€/mois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131122\" width=\"658\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-300x300.png 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-150x150.png 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-768x768.png 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1.png 1081w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Bon à savoir</em> : le prix affiché est de 2.22 $ (ou 2.25 €), mais au paiement ce sera ramené vers le bas&nbsp;autour de&nbsp;2.05 € (selon le taux de change du jour, pas merci à l&rsquo;€ de se faire défoncer depuis quelques mois).

Si vous utilisez déjà Surfshark pour surfer, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien de plus à installer pour profiter de l&rsquo;antivirus. Celui-ci est intégré au logiciel et ça permet d&rsquo;alléger votre machine en ayant un seul outil qui fait tout.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l4w-surfshark-antivirus\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Disponible sous Windows, macOS et Android, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark est vraiment très facile à utiliser</a>. Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Slick Inbox reçoit alors les missives électroniques pour les centraliser dans son application !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221006-m1g.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130710\" width=\"542\" height=\"548\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous ne connaissez pas de bonnes newsletters auxquelles vous abonner, ne vous inquiétez pas puisque Slick Inbox propose un kiosque avec des tonnes de newsletters classées par catégories : Design, Marketing, Développement Personnel, Technologie, Jeux Vidéos, Musique, Développement, Finance et j&rsquo;en passe&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi l&rsquo;application vous permet également de recevoir des motifs, de mettre en favori certaines newsletters, mais également d&rsquo;archiver ce que vous voulez&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un nouveau moyen bien pratique pour conjuguer ce moyen de communication archaïque qu&rsquo;est la newsletter avec nos vies trépidantes d&rsquo;hommes et de femmes modernes qui n&rsquo;ont pas de temps à perdre avec leur boite mail (genre moi).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ps : Je crois également que <a href=\"https://korben.info/feedly.html\"><strong>Feedly</strong></a> fait ça aussi.</p>\n",

Mais la vérité est ailleurs surtout pour les développeurs qui savent que le monde se divise en réalité entre le Frontend et le Backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour que ces 2 faces d&rsquo;une même pièce puissent « discuter », il nous faut des API. API, ça veut dire Application Programming Interface et c&rsquo;est tout simplement un ensemble d&rsquo;instructions permettant aux applications de communiquer entre elles. Maintenant des types d&rsquo;API, il y en a des tonnes, mais je vous propose qu&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui on s&rsquo;intéresse aux API qui respectent le standard architectural REST. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, quand on travaille en tant que développeur, on ne peut pas passer à côté des API REST, tant cette pratique est très répandue. Si vous débutez dans votre métier, c&rsquo;est forcement quelque chose que vous devez apprendre et maitriser. De la même manière, quand on débute sa carrière de développeur ou qu&rsquo;on a déjà beaucoup d&rsquo;années au compteur mais qu&rsquo;on ne connaît pas sa valeur sur le marché de l&#8217;emploi, il est bon de connaître la grille des salaires en France. Ça tombe bien puisque&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io a mis en ligne une étude des salaires de la tech en 2022</a></strong>&nbsp;pour que vous puissiez déterminer si votre salaire est correct ou sous évalué.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à vous plonger dedans afin de savoir où vous vous situez sur cette grille des salaires.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\"><img src=\"https://me.korben.info/w96-talent-bun\" alt=\"\" width=\"733\" height=\"484\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>C&rsquo;est quoi une API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>REST, ça veut dire « Representational State Transfer ». Lorsqu&rsquo;une API respecte les contraintes de REST, on parle alors d&rsquo;une API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand un développeur veut créer une API RESTful, il doit alors respecter les contraintes édictées par REST, notamment sur le fait que son API doit fonctionner au travers du protocole HTTP et de ses verbes (GET, POST&#8230;etc.) et que les requêtes et les réponses de l&rsquo;API soient dans un format texte tels que JSON, HTML, XML&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les API RESTful sont alors mises à disposition des applications via ce qu&rsquo;on appelle des endpoints. Un endpoint est un assemblage de 2 choses : une URI et un verbe HTTP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admettons que j&rsquo;ai une API qui permette de lister des utilisateurs, mais également d&rsquo;en créer des nouveaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;URI de mon API est la suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:&#47;&#47;url.com/api/user</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le but du jeu, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;appeler par exemple ce endpoint avec le verbe GET pour obtenir une liste de tous les utilisateurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>GET: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou pour ajouter un nouvel utilisateur, on peut utiliser le verbe POST comme ceci, en transmettant un bout de JSON contenant toutes les informations liées à l&rsquo;utilisateur qu&rsquo;on souhaite créer (nom, prénom&#8230;etc.) : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>POST: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée là, c&rsquo;est de vous montrer qu&rsquo;on peut interagir avec l&rsquo;API à l&rsquo;aide de différents verbes HTTP. Get peut être assimilé au verbe « lire », POST au verbe « créer », PUT et PATCH au verbe « Mettre à jour » et DELETE au verbe « supprimer ». C&rsquo;est aussi simple que cela. Et en retour le serveur peut alors répondre avec des codes de status HTTP classiques comme 200, 201, 2002&#8230;etc. pour dire que tout est OK, ou des codes de redirection 3xx, d&rsquo;erreur client 4xx ou d&rsquo;erreur serveur 5xx.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ce qui concerne le format utilisé par les requêtes et les réponses, vous pouvez utiliser du texte, peu importe son format (html, xml.etc.), mais par convention, on utilise surtout du JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Et JSON ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON a la particularité d&rsquo;être facile à lire et à écrire pour les humains et est utilisé pour enregistrer des données dans des bases de données, mais également pour transmettre ces données entre les applications. C&rsquo;est pourquoi on l&rsquo;utilise dans les API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON est une collection de paires nom / valeur qui sont ordonnées dans une liste. Ainsi les valeurs contenues dans le JSON peuvent être une chaine de caractère (string), un nombre, mais également des objets JSON, des tableaux de valeurs (Array), des booléens (true / false) ou la fameuse valeur null.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà concernant les grands principes des API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comment créer votre première API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant je vous propose qu&rsquo;on apprenne à en créer une de zéro. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est super simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour cette démo, j&rsquo;ai choisi d&rsquo;utiliser Python comme d&rsquo;habitude. Et je vais importer dans mon code le framework <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flask</a> qui va me permettre de faire monter mon API RESTful très facilement. Installez Flask comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pip3 install flask-restful</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour tester l&rsquo;API, nous allons utiliser un outil qui permet à la fois de balancer nos requêtes et de voir si les réponses correspondent bien. L&rsquo;un des plus connus s&rsquo;appelle Postman et c&rsquo;est gratuit en version de base pour tester. L&rsquo;application Desktop de Postman <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">est disponible ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/3y1-talent-API-REST\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, nous allons définir ce que va faire notre API. Ce sera quelque chose d&rsquo;assez simple permettant de créer, supprimer, lire et mettre à jour des données. Admettons que j&rsquo;ai un site sur lequel je dois référencer des produits. Chacun de ces produits aura un id, un nom, un prix et une catégorie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le code de votre première API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vais donc créer un fichier productAPI.py et je vais importer Flask comme ceci avec ses imports spécifiques aux API et au parsing JSON :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api, reqparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Puis je vais créer une espèce de mini base de données JSON directement dans mon code afin d&rsquo;y référencer mes produits :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>products = &#91;\n    { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Stylo 4 couleurs\", \"price\": 10, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cahier vert\", \"price\": 20, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Télévision 4K\", \"price\": 30, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Souris sans fil\", \"price\": 40, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 5, \"name\": \"Ananas\", \"price\": 50, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 6, \"name\": \"Kinder Bueno\", \"price\": 60, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 7, \"name\": \"Chemise de président\", \"price\": 70, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 8, \"name\": \"T-shirt de punk\", \"price\": 80, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 9, \"name\": \"Tournevis bleu\", \"price\": 90, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" },\n    { \"id\": 10, \"name\": \"Marteau rouge\", \"price\": 100, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" }\n    ]</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant on va créer une classe Product qui sera vu comme un endpoint au niveau de notre API. Et dans cette class, nous allons placer nos 4 fonctions correspondantes aux 4 verbes HTTP dont je vous ai parlé plus haut.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>class Product(Resource):\n\n    def get(self, id):\n\n    def post(self, id):\n\n    def put(self, id):\n\n    def delete(self, id):</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La structure de base de notre API est OK. Maintenant, on va définir chacune de ces fonctions en commençant par la fonction get utilisée pour récupérer les informations d&rsquo;un produit à partir de son ID. Comme vous pouvez le voir, on fait une boucle « for » qui va parcourir l&rsquo;ensemble des produits et si l&rsquo;ID correspond à ce qui spécifié dans la requête, on renvoie l&rsquo;objet « product » avec son code HTTP 200 et si ce n&rsquo;est pas le cas, on renvoie un message « Produit introuvable » accompagné d&rsquo;un code d&rsquo;erreur HTTP 404 qui correspond à une ressource non trouvée.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return product, 200\n        return \"Produit introuvable\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction suivante va nous permettre de créer un nouveau produit. La donnée utilisée dans la requête étant structurée en JSON, cette fonction va utiliser le parseur de Flask pour extraire toutes les données du JSON et les ajouter à notre tableau de produits : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def post(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return \"Ce produit {} existe deja\".format(id), 400\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois que le produit est créé, on retourne le code 201 qui veut dire que la création s&rsquo;est bien déroulée. Et si le produit existait déjà avec cet ID, on renvoie le code 400 avec un message d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction put suivante est assez similaire puisqu&rsquo;elle permet à la fois de créer un nouveau produit (si l&rsquo;id n&rsquo;est pas encore utilisé) ou de mettre à jour un produit existant.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def put(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                product&#91;\"name\"] = args&#91;\"name\"]\n                product&#91;\"price\"] = args&#91;\"price\"]\n                product&#91;\"category\"] = args&#91;\"category\"]\n                return product, 200\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, la fonction delete permettra de supprimer un enregistrement à partir de son ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def delete(self, id):\n        global products\n        products = &#91;product for product in products if product&#91;\"id\"] != id]\n        return \"{} is deleted.\".format(id), 200</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois ces fonctions définies, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à spécifier le format de l&rsquo;URI qui sera utilisé pour appeler l&rsquo;API et lancer l&rsquo;API (en mode debug pour démarrer). Le paramètre &lt;int:id&gt; permet d&rsquo;indiquer que dans le chemin du endpoint, on peut ajouter une variable acceptée par l&rsquo;API (ici l&rsquo;ID du produit).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>api.add_resource(Product, \"/product/&lt;int:id&gt;\")\napp.run(debug=True)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tester l&rsquo;API avec Postman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à lancer le script python à l&rsquo;aide de la commande suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python3 productAPI.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serveur web de Flask se lancera alors et vous verrez apparaitre une URL locale que vous pourrez appeler dans Postman pour ensuite tester votre API.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

produit (grâce à son ID) : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

qu&rsquo;on souhaite transmettre un contenu de type « RAW » au format JSON et appeler le endpoint avec l&rsquo;ID de notre nouveau produit (ce n&rsquo;est pas l&rsquo;idéal bien sûr, car le principe d&rsquo;un nouvel ID c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il soit généré directement par le code de l&rsquo;API, mais c&rsquo;est pour illustrer mon exemple).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure

/></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Et ensuite ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, ce n&rsquo;est vraiment pas compliqué à développer. Ici on est sur un exemple simple, mais ensuite, vous devrez pourquoi pas sortir vos données d&rsquo;une base de données, penser à correctement gérer les erreurs et faire preuve de rigueur dans la structure de vos endpoints. Par exemple, dans mon endpoint, l&rsquo;URI est xxxx/product/. J&rsquo;aurais pu faire mieux en respectant la convention et en mettant/products/ au pluriel. Car en cas de GET, je peux aussi demander à récupérer l&rsquo;ensemble des produits existants. Dans ce cas, je dois modifier ma fonction GET comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        if (id == 0):\n            return products, 200\n        else:\n            for product in products:\n                if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                    return product, 200\n            return \"Product not found\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, en passant l&rsquo;id 0 lors de mon GET, je récupérerai alors tous les produits.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"687\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130939\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp 687w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99-268x300.webp 268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas également de documenter l&rsquo;ensemble de votre API afin de vous y retrouver et surtout d&rsquo;indiquer à d&rsquo;autres développeurs, comment l&rsquo;intégrer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà, j&rsquo;espère que cette petite initiation et explications aux API RESTful vous aura intéressé et donné envie de vous y mettre plus sérieusement. Peut-être changer un peu votre façon de coder, voire carrément changer de job pour trouver une équipe plus agile et plus au fait des pratiques de dev modernes. Et pourquoi pas en profiter pour continuer à évoluer dans les technologies, ou obtenir un meilleur salaire. C’est une démarche qui peut s’avérer assez compliquée, stressante parfois, tant on a envie de trouver un travail qui nous corresponde. On peut souhaiter avoir un travail plus proche de chez soi voire en télétravail complet, un meilleur salaire, une meilleure ambiance au travail, ou même tout ça à la fois (mais ce n’est pas forcément facile à trouver).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heureusement, talent.io est là pour vous aider. Il vous suffit de&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">créer un compte sur la plateforme talent.io</a></strong>&nbsp;en quelques clics pour ensuite recevoir des offres de la part d’entreprises qui correspondent à vos critères précis et qui affichent un salaire d’entrée de jeu. talent.io est vraiment le moyen le plus simple de trouver son prochain job tech, d’ailleurs les inscrits trouvent leur emploi en 20 jours en moyenne.</p>\n",

Ce site vous permet de construire des « prompts », c&rsquo;est-à-dire des phrases à destination d&rsquo;outils comme Midjourney ou encore Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le principe est simple. Vous lui passez des URLs d&rsquo;images dont vous aimez le style, vous agrémentez tout cela de mots clés que vous pouvez pondérer puis vous pouvez choisir <a href=\"https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">des tas de paramètres et de styles</a> proposés et supportés par votre générateur (au hasard Midjourney) afin d&rsquo;obtenir le résultat de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Après moultes essais et inspiration prise dans la galerie de Midjourney et à l&rsquo;aide de DoctorMars (fidèle de Korben.info), j&rsquo;ai réussi à passer de ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130559\" width=\"493\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-300x79.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-768x203.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-779997892\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>À ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130560\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-300x300.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-150x150.webp 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-768x768.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce que je peux vous dire, c&rsquo;est que ce n&rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&rsquo;il y parait.

On s&rsquo;affronte par équipe de 4 en balançant de l&rsquo;encre partout ; et c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;équipe qui aura colorié le plus de territoire de sa propre couleur qui gagne la partie. C&rsquo;est ici que le jeu se démarque, car même si vous ne savez pas très bien viser, vous pouvez être utile à votre équipe. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Splatoon 3 – Maintenant disponible !

On peut facilement varier les plaisirs !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les modes de jeu, eux aussi, sont variés. Entre les matchs classiques, les parties « ranked » (matchs « anarchie » avec différentes règles du jeu possible !), ou bien en coopératif… Il y a de quoi faire ! On a même un jeu de carte assez cool, où l&rsquo;on construit son propre deck. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130718\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-300x168.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-768x431.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02.jpg 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le mode solo n&rsquo;est pas en reste, il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un tutorial géant mais vraiment sympa, où l&rsquo;on alterne entre phases d&rsquo;exploration et épreuves, nous faisant découvrir un large éventail d&rsquo;armes et de techniques. Bref, au niveau du contenu, c&rsquo;est vraiment généreux, sans même parler des cosmétiques, rangs et armes à débloquer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1910884207\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Techniquement, hormis la Cité-clabousse qui rame (allez savoir pourquoi), le jeu est ultra bien foutu : c&rsquo;est beau, lisible, super fluide ! La plate-forme réseau manque encore un peu de stabilité, mais elle est toute récente et s&rsquo;améliore continuellement, donc sur le moyen/long terme ça devrait le faire. Enfin j&rsquo;espère. 🤞</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130719\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Les menus ne sont pas d&rsquo;une ergonomie sans faille, ils ont voulu faire un truc classe avec un hub, des boutiques, etc. C&rsquo;est joli mais au final on se perd un peu, on perd du temps, et pire, on passe à côté de certaines options (perso j&rsquo;ai mis un temps fou à comprendre comment jouer à Cartes &amp; Territoire, ou comment modifier la skin de mon inkling)… C&rsquo;est un peu dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ceci étant dit, c&rsquo;est toujours mieux que dans Splatoon 2 ! 😁 Il y a de nettes améliorations, par exemple, on peut zapper l&rsquo;introduction de chaque nouvelle rotation de maps. Y a eu de vrais efforts pour rendre l&rsquo;expérience plus agréable. Quelques autres apports, en vrac :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Un meilleur lobby (avec entrainement pendant l&rsquo;attente, etc.)</li><li>De nouveaux mouvements pour nos calamars</li><li>Un casier à décorer avec des stickers</li><li>Nouvelles armes, maps, cosmétiques…</li><li>Les matchs à 3 équipes !</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130720\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Concrètement, ce n&rsquo;est pas une suite révolutionnaire, mais elle améliore et apporte plein de petites choses. Au final, quand on met tout bout à bout, ça fait une grosse différence. Si vous aimez les shooters, c&rsquo;est super original et surtout : très fun !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e9cJAw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acheter Splatoon 3 sur Nintendo Switch</a></h2>\n",

C&rsquo;est à dire qu&rsquo;on fait la course, mais en se goinfrant le plus possible sur le chemin : car c&rsquo;est la personne qui aura dévoré le plus de sucreries à la fin des 4 manches qui aura gagné. 😋 Deux manches sur circuits (à la manière d&rsquo;un Mario Kart en plus léger), et deux manches en arène (où on ramasse un max de gourmandises en essayant de faire tomber les autres pour piquer les leurs) : à la fin on pèse les Kirbys et que le plus lourd gagne !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130668\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le gameplay se résume à l&rsquo;essentiel : déplacement, saut, attaque spéciale (grâce aux bonus récupérés ici et là). Il y a juste la gestion de l&rsquo;inertie, propre à la petite boule qu&rsquo;on dirige, qui va demander quelques petites minutes d&rsquo;adaptation : le concept est aussi simple que la prise en main est immédiate, c&rsquo;est un party-game d&rsquo;une efficacité assez redoutable. Et tellement mignon&#8230; 🥰</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niveau contenu, en terme de modes de jeux ou nombre de circuits/niveaux, là aussi on se contente de l&rsquo;essentiel. Pas de quoi être déçu, car c&rsquo;est cohérent avec le prix affiché (15€). Pour les fous furieux, sachez qu&rsquo;il y a des tonnes de petits cosmétiques et autres à débloquer. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130669\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1146385180\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Jouable à 4 en ligne ou en local (chacun sa console), mais pas en écran splitté sur la même console : là on est limités à 2 joueurs.

Donc du matos réellement testé sur lequel chacun vient donner son avis. À vous ensuite de faire le tri en fonction de ce qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Est-ce le prix, la note du benchmark, la capacité, la vitesse ou la note globale ?
