Vous ne les connaissez peut-être pas encore et pourtant, 3CX s&rsquo;occupe de la communication de plus 600 000 clients, le tout dans 190 pays différents, pour un total très impressionnant de 12 millions d&rsquo;utilisateurs. 3CX est d&rsquo;ailleurs la solution retenue par Mac Donald, Somfy, Air France, Toyota ou encore Pepsi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, ils font partie des leaders de leur secteur et maîtrisent parfaitement les sujets liés à la <strong>VoIP / WebRTC</strong>. Et si je vous en parle aujourd&rsquo;hui, c&rsquo;est pour vous présenter leur <strong>offre StartUP</strong> qui a la particularité d&rsquo;être <strong>totalement gratuite</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Votre standard téléphonique pour 0 € / mois</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette offre permet aux indépendants comme moi, mais également aux sociétés de moins de 10 personnes, de disposer d&rsquo;une plateforme de communication interne hyper complète et évidemment de qualité. Cela vous permettra de communiquer rapidement et facilement avec vos collaborateurs, vos clients et même les internautes de passage sur votre site web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Très pratique si vous êtes une startup ou une PME qui met à disposition un numéro de téléphone ou qui dispose d&rsquo;un webchat sur son site web pour répondre à toutes les demandes de ses clients. Je pense notamment à tous les e-commerçants ou les startups naissantes qui n&rsquo;ont pas encore les moyens des grosses entreprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est pour cela que 3CX propose une solution de standard téléphonique et de plateforme de messagerie gérée par leurs soins et dans certains cas, hébergée sur vos propres serveurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8874b5-3CX\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"300\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>L&rsquo;offre StartUP Free</strong></a> est donc un bon moyen de découvrir les possibilités de la plateforme de 3CX sans débourser un centime.

Vous en serez le manager et vous pourrez alors ajouter des utilisateurs qui recevront à leur tour un email qui leur expliquera comment se connecter à la plateforme.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dm6Z.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131534\" width=\"599\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dm6Z.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dm6Z-300x166.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dm6Z-768x425.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Découvrez l&rsquo;interface de 3CX</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>À partir de là, vous pouvez créer un groupe d&rsquo;appel qui rassemblera toutes les personnes habilitées à répondre au téléphone. Une stratégie de groupe est alors possible pour que lorsqu&rsquo;un appel entrant arrive, il soit basculé aux membres du groupe. C&rsquo;est un véritable standard VoIP qui vous permettra de recueillir tous les appels entrants liés à votre business.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-f2d.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131526\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-f2d.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-f2d-300x214.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-f2d-768x547.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Chaque appel est placé en liste d&rsquo;attente pendant un certain moment, avec la musique et le message vocal de votre choix, et si personne ne décroche pendant un certain temps, les appels peuvent alors être terminés, renvoyés vers un autre groupe, ou basculés vers un répondeur&#8230;etc. Finie la frustration d&rsquo;entendre un numéro de téléphone qui sonne occupé. Vous accueillez vos clients comme il se doit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, de quoi gérer votre propre petit standard téléphonique gratuitement et surtout facilement, car l&rsquo;interface est vraiment très propre et très claire. Pas besoin d&rsquo;être technicien pour se l&rsquo;approprier.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/webclient_apps.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131541\" width=\"686\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/webclient_apps.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/webclient_apps-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/webclient_apps-768x434.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Les applications clientes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>En termes d&rsquo;interface, vous pouvez passer via le navigateur avec l&rsquo;interface web ou via l&rsquo;une des applications Desktop (Windows, macOS) ou mobile (iOS, Android), ce qui est vraiment super pratique si vous utilisez 3CX toute la journée ou si vous êtes en déplacement avec votre seul smartphone.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dtr.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131535\" width=\"317\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dtr.webp 497w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-dtr-194x300.webp 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La configuration de l&rsquo;application mobile est également très simple puisqu&rsquo;une fois installée, il suffit de scanner un QR Code reçu par email pour valider la configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>La visioconférence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, vous pourrez sans soucis passer et recevoir des appels, mais surtout organiser des Visio-conf, des webinaires&#8230;etc. et y participer. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-ljr.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131537\" width=\"538\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-ljr.webp 883w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-ljr-300x261.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-ljr-768x668.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Tout se fait très simplement avec la création d&rsquo;un email d&rsquo;invitation contenant un lien, que chaque participant reçoit. En cliquant dessus, le moment venu, il rejoindra alors la réunion avec ou sans application. Vous pourrez alors vous voir, discuter et même échanger des documents ou faire une présentation à distance. Rien de plus simple.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/video-conference-call.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131540\" width=\"519\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/video-conference-call.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/video-conference-call-300x173.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/video-conference-call-768x442.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous pourrez ainsi gérer un planning d&rsquo;appels ou de réunions et suivre tout votre historique de communication. Très pratique si vous faites de la prospection par exemple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>La messagerie LiveChat &amp; WhatsApp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>La messagerie interne de la plateforme est également un moyen très pratique de discuter entre collègues pour gérer le quotidien. Mais c&rsquo;est surtout pour proposer un canal de communication type SMS à vos clients que l&rsquo;offre de 3CX devient intéressante. Vous pourrez par exemple proposer une interaction via <strong>WhatsApp</strong> à vos clients, simplement avec l&rsquo;offre StartUP Free.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-lul.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131539\" width=\"434\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-lul.webp 705w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-lul-275x300.webp 275w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-fa0.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131528\" width=\"739\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-fa0.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-fa0-300x149.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221122-fa0-768x381.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Même chose pour la partie <strong>LiveChat</strong> qui peut être déployée sur n&rsquo;importe quel site web notamment <strong>WordPress</strong>, à l&rsquo;aide d&rsquo;un plugin très simple à configurer.

Cela vous permettra d&rsquo;avoir un suivi des conversations avec votre clientèle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque membre du groupe peut également paramétrer ses heures de présence pour que le standard sache où et quand renvoyer les appels. C&rsquo;est plutôt génial d&rsquo;avoir un outil totalement VoIP comme celui-ci qui peut être parfaitement utilisé par les gens en télétravail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>3CX a vraiment fait du très bon travail. Comme je le disais, l&rsquo;outil est simple à prendre en main, même pour le néophyte et chacun peut alors bénéficier d&rsquo;un standard VoIP gratuitement. Les visioconférences et les appels téléphoniques sont parfaitement fluides et d&rsquo;un bon niveau de qualité, mais surtout, ce qui fait la force de 3CX c&rsquo;est vraiment l&rsquo;implémentation de ces technologies (VoIP / WebRTC) dans une suite qui offre toutes les fonctionnalités nécessaires aux petites, moyennes et grandes entreprises qui ont des besoins de communication clientèle. De plus, les fonctionnalités de messagerie que ce soit via WhatsApp ou Livechat, en intégration sur un site web, sont idéales pour recueillir les échanges clients en réduisant les temps d&rsquo;attente et les temps d&rsquo;échange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, c&rsquo;est vraiment un outil à essayer si vous avez besoin de mettre en place un live chat ou un standard téléphonique. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pour vous inscrire, c&rsquo;est par ici</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous avez besoin de documentation, <a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/docs/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">celle-ci se trouve ici</a>.</p>\n",

Seulement voilà, malgré tout l&rsquo;amour que vous portez à Firefox, vous restez quand même conscient que parfois, il peut bouffer un peu *trop* de mémoire.

Alors c&rsquo;est vrai que Windows sait également nettoyer la mémoire, mais il ne le fait pas aussi souvent que Firmin qui lui veille particulièrement sur Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois Firemin lancé, vous choisissez une fréquence de « nettoyage » en millisecondes (par défaut c&rsquo;est 1000 ms), mais les développeurs de Firemin indiquent que les résultats seront meilleurs avec 500 ms. Vous pouvez également spécifier une quantité de mémoire propre à Firefox, à ne pas dépasser (ici 100 MB).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131157\" width=\"433\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp 655w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2-256x300.webp 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Là où c&rsquo;est sympa, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez lui indiquer d&rsquo;autres navigateurs (Chrome, Brave, Edge&#8230;etc.) en cliquant simplement sur le bouton « Parcourir ». J&rsquo;imagine que ça peut fonctionner également avec d&rsquo;autres applications qui ne sont pas des navigateurs, donc à essayer sur vos applications consommatrices de mémoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil doit être lancé en même temps que le navigateur pour fonctionner, donc pensez bien à cocher la case « Démarrer Firemin quand Windows démarre » pour ensuite l&rsquo;oublier.

Sur du FPS, pour être bien il faudrait que le ping soit à minima bien en dessous des 60ms et qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait aucun paquet perdu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même chose pour les visioconférences ou la VoIP, vous devez avoir quelque chose de bon niveau ping et une certaine régularité dans l&rsquo;arrivée de vos paquets TCP pour que la discussion reste compréhensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-637267545\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors, comment évaluer ça ? Et bien rendez-vous sur le site <a href=\"https://packetlosstest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Packet Loss Test</a> pour mesurer la fiabilité de votre connexion, et déterminer à la fois la latence, mais également le pourcentage de paquets perdus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131060\" width=\"717\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-300x170.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-768x435.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>De mon côté, je suis plutôt pas mal. Si de votre côté, vous avez beaucoup de paquets perdus, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcément la faute de votre FAI. Jouez avec les réglages du site pour adapter le test à votre bande passante maximale.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"617\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp 617w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw-241x300.webp 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si ça ne change rien, il est fort probable que vous ayez sur votre réseau local, un routeur ou une carte réseau qui se comporte mal. Il faudra alors jouer au jeu du « <em>Je te débranche, je re-teste et je vois si ça va mieux</em>« .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, si rien ne cloche, un petit coup de fil au fournisseur d&rsquo;accès internet. Bon courage avec cette dernière étape.</p>\n",

I’ve heard some pretty <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/buzzword-convergence-making-sense-of-quantum-neural-blockchain-ai/'>wacky startup pitches</a> over the years, but this might possibly be the all-time winner. </p>\n<p>But as I thought about it, I realized that beyond the “absurdly extreme moonshot” character of this pitch, there’s some science that I’ve done that makes it clear that it’s also fundamentally philosophically confused. The nature of the confusion is interesting, however, and untangling it will give us an opportunity to illuminate some deep features of both intelligence and technology—and in the end suggest a way to think about the long-term trajectory of the very concept of technology and its relation to our universe.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with a scenario. Let’s say one of the little spacecraft comes across a planet where it sees complicated swirling patterns:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img1a.png\" alt='The Jupiter Great Red Spot' title='The Jupiter Great Red Spot' width='564' height='368' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img1a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"more-38447\"></span></p>\n<p><spacer></p>\n<p>The spacecraft sends out a probe to “make contact”. The swirling pattern “responds” by changing slightly. The spacecraft analyzes the change, and sends out another probe. And pretty soon there’s a whole “conversation” going on between the spacecraft and the planet. But, you might say, that’s nothing like an “intelligence” there; there’s just a “pure physical system” that operates through physical laws. </p>\n<p>OK, but now let’s imagine the spacecraft has returned to Earth and is checking it out. It detects complicated <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--artificial-radio-signals/'>patterns of radio signals</a>. It sends out a radio signal of its own. Something on Earth responds. A “conversation” ensues. Maybe the spacecraft is “talking to” a cellphone tower, doing automated handshakes with it. Maybe it reached a ham radio operator, and is exchanging Morse code with them. Or maybe—in an ultimate version of code injection—there’s a computer that’s interpreting the spacecraft’s signals as a program, and is sending back the results of running the program.</p>\n<p>It all seems quite sophisticated—and at some level worthy of the technological civilization we’ve built up here on Earth. But let’s zoom out a bit. There’s something coming from the spacecraft, that’s causing something to happen on Earth, that’s causing something to be returned to the spacecraft.</p>\n<p>And ultimately whatever is happening on Earth must be a physical process of some kind—operating according to the laws of physics. So what’s the difference between this and those swirling “just physics” patterns that the spacecraft found on the other planet? Everything is ultimately “just physics” after all. </p>\n<p>OK, you might say, that’s surely true. But on Earth, even though we might have started from physics, we’ve somehow now “ascended” through chemistry and biology and technology to get to something that’s fundamentally more sophisticated. But here we run into an important—if at first surprising—piece of basic science: my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we represent all those “physical processes” as computations (and our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> implies that all of physics is indeed ultimately computational). Now we can compare the computations that correspond to the planet with the swirling patterns to the ones that correspond to our Earth with us humans in the loop.</p>\n<p>And what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that they’re ultimately equivalent. The computations associated with the swirling patterns are ultimately just as sophisticated as the ones we achieve with our brains and our technology here on Earth. It’s far from obvious that this would be true. But it’s something one discovers when one <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html'>explores the computational universe of possible programs</a>.</p>\n<p>One might think that simple programs would produce only simple behavior, and that somehow the behavior would get progressively more complex with more complicated programs. But that’s not what one finds. Instead, there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/'>increasing evidence</a> that almost any program that doesn’t show obviously simple behavior can in fact show behavior that is as sophisticated as anything. </p>\n<p>It’s been known for about a century that there exist computation universal systems capable of being “programmed” to do essentially any computation. But what the Principle of Computational Equivalence says is that sophisticated computation is not only possible—even for simple programs—but is something that happens generically and ubiquitously. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean for our spacecraft? It means that what the spacecraft sees on Earth can be computationally no more sophisticated than what it sees on the planet with the swirling patterns. Yes, we consider there to be “intelligence” here on Earth. But what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that ultimately there’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>nothing abstractly different going on</a> from what’s going on in the swirling patterns.</p>\n<p>So if we characterize what’s going on here on Earth as an example of “intelligence” we really should say that those swirling patterns are also “examples of intelligence”. And, yes, it doesn’t seem much like human intelligence. But at an abstract computational level it’s really operating like intelligence—but to us humans it’s “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>There’s a common saying: “The weather has a mind of its own”. And what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that, yes, fluid dynamics in the atmosphere—and all the swirling patterns associated with it—are examples of computation that are just as sophisticated as those associated with human minds.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so there’s a sense in which the weather “has a mind of its own”. But it’s definitely not a “human-like mind”. Yes, the weather does sophisticated computations. But there’s no obvious way to attribute to those computations the purposes and intentions and other typical features of how we describe what goes on in a human mind. So if indeed we’re going to talk about the weather as being an intelligence, for us humans we have to consider it an “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>We started off talking about spacecraft going out into the cosmos to discover alien intelligence. But what the Principle Computational Equivalence is telling us is that actually there’s what we can think of as alien intelligence all around us. Yes, we humans have managed to get to the point where we do all sorts of sophisticated computations. But computations of just the same sophistication are being done in all sorts of systems that don’t have that whole human tower of biology and technology.</p>\n<p>For a long time it’s been a mystery why we’ve <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>never detected alien intelligence</a> out there in the cosmos. But actually I think there’s no lack of “alien intelligence”; indeed it’s all around us. But the point is that it really is alien. At an abstract computational level it’s like our intelligence. But in its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>details it&#8217;s not aligned with our intelligence</a>. Abstractly it’s intelligence, but it’s not human-like intelligence. It’s alien intelligence.</p>\n<h2 id='the-role-of-science-and-technology'>The Role of Science and Technology</h2>\n<p>OK, so we can think of lots of systems as being examples of “alien intelligence”. But how does that alien intelligence connect to our human intelligence? Sometimes it’s close enough that we humans can immediately “anthropomorphize” the system to “understand what it’s doing in human terms”. But often we need to put effort into “making a bridge”. And in fact we can view that as being what science and technology are ultimately trying to do. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re looking at swirling patterns in a fluid. The fluid is doing what it does, in effect continually running a computation that generates its behavior. But how can we &#8220;align&#8221; that with what&#8217;s going on in our brains? That&#8217;s where science comes in. Because what science is trying to do is to extract some kind of &#8220;human-relatable narrative&#8221; from the actual behavior of a system out there in the world. Or in some sense it’s trying to provide a “channel” through which we can <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>&#8220;communicate&#8221; with the &#8220;alien intelligence&#8221;</a> that is embodied in what’s out there in the world.</p>\n<p>So what about technology? Fundamentally <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-11--implications-for-technology'>technology is about trying to take what exists</a> out there in the world, and apply it to achieve human purposes. We have a fluid. Now we use it to create hydraulic technology that achieves some practical human purpose. We can see the history of technology as being a progressive effort to identify things out there in the world (metal ore, photoelectricity, liquid crystals, &#8230;) that can be sampled and fashioned in such a way as to achieve certain purposes we want.</p>\n<p>And insofar as we think of what’s out there in the world as being like alien intelligence, what technology is doing is finding ways to corral that intelligence into achieving human purposes. The truth is that in most of our technology today, we’re not letting that intelligence really do <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-2--the-need-for-a-new-intuition'>anything close to what it&#8217;s capable of</a>. We’re keeping it tightly constrained to take only steps that we can readily understand and foresee. It’s a bit like having a horse with a harness that constrains it to just walk slowly in a straight line—even though without the harness the horse could gallop around and do all sorts of elaborate things, albeit things that we might not readily be able to understand or foresee.</p>\n<p>So let’s come back to the spacecraft. It’s reached a planet. And it’s interacting with what’s there. Perhaps there’s some weird electrical storm going on. And, yes, we can think of that as an example of alien intelligence. But if the mission of the spacecraft is to discover technology then what it needs to do is to figure out whether there’s some way to interact with the electrical storm so as to achieve some human purpose.</p>\n<p>The storm does what the storm does. But maybe by moving some piece of metal around in just the right way it’s possible to get the storm to charge a battery. Or, more elaborately, perhaps processes in the storm could be used like an analog computer, say to compute solutions to equations. And perhaps—having seen the storm on this planet—it’s even possible to “bottle it up” and replicate it, say in a piece of consumer electronics.</p>\n<p>One way to describe what’s going on is just to say rather prosaically that we discovered a phenomenon on the planet, that we were able to use for technology. But more colorfully we could say that we encountered an alien intelligence, we found a way to communicate with it, and then we “brought back” technology from it.</p>\n<p>The original startup pitch was about spacecraft getting technology by discovering alien intelligence out in the cosmos. But really the whole spacecraft thing is a distraction. Because actually—as we’ve discussed—there’s plenty we can describe as “alien intelligence” all around us, even right here on Earth. And the issue is in a sense just how to “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>communicate with it</a>” and find ways to “harness it” for our technological purposes.</p>\n<p>We’ve learned in the past century that we can use electrons in semiconductors as a way to build computers. But what about other physical processes? Maybe flowing fluids, for example. Can we use that “alien intelligence” to make a new kind of computer? In the end, the point is that any technology is about finding and harnessing “alien intelligence”. That’s basically just what technology is, and always has been.</p>\n<p>The whole “alien intelligence” part of the story, though, is much more relevant when we’re thinking of technology that makes serious use of what we can identify as sophisticated computation. If we’re just using a system from nature for its physical mass, it doesn’t really feel as if we’re using its “intelligence”. But as soon as we try, for example, to base a general computer on it, it’s a quite different story. </p>\n<p>In getting technology from the universe we’re basically picking out certain aspects of what exists and choosing to apply these for our purposes. In doing science it seems like we have “less choice” about what aspects of the universe we deal with. After all, we might imagine that science is trying to give us a way to understand anything that’s out there in the universe. But in reality it’s much more like technology. The “scientific narratives” that we understand—at least at a given time in history—are ones that we’re in a sense “primed for”. Yes, something like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-4--fluid-flow'>fluid turbulence</a> might give us “in-your-face” exposure to something computationally sophisticated that’s far from what we normally talk about. But what science mostly concentrates on is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>creating narratives that are aligned</a> with our existing scientific understanding and discussions—much as technology is set up to be about things that are aligned with our existing human purposes.</p>\n<h2 id='extracting-technology-from-the-ruliad'>Extracting Technology from the Ruliad</h2>\n<p>One might imagine that—wherever it ultimately comes from—technology must at least always in the end be based on the laws of physics. But what’s emerging from our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> is that actually the story is considerably more complicated than that. </p>\n<p>It all begins with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>: the object that represents the entangled limit of all possible computations. The ruliad is a unique, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>formally necessary object</a>, that in a sense embodies all conceivable existence. And inevitably we are embedded within the ruliad, sampling certain aspects of it to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>form our perception of reality</a>.</p>\n<p>In principle there are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad'>all sorts of kinds of observers of the ruliad</a>, with all sorts of kinds of perceptions of reality. But the key point that has emerged as a foundation of our Physics Project is that “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#observers-like-us'>observers like us</a>” have certain general characteristics—specifically that we assume that we are persistent through time, and also that we are computationally bounded—and from these characteristics alone, we can abstractly deduce from the structure of the ruliad that we must “experience” core standard laws of known physics.</p>\n<p>The ruliad in a sense contains all possible physicses. But it’s our particular kind of sampling of the ruliad that leads us to the particular laws of physics that we currently know. An “alien intelligence” might sample the ruliad quite differently, and thus in effect “experience” quite different laws of physics.</p>\n<p>Somewhere underneath everything we can think of there being a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>giant hypergraph of individual atoms of existence</a>—but with the means of perception observers like us have, we inevitably “coarse grain” to the point where, for example, we experience this as continuous space. Another kind of observer, with different characteristics, might, for example, not do that coarse graining, might never experience continuous space, and might have a completely different perception of how the universe works.</p>\n<p>In some sense, therefore, physics is much more like technology than we might expect. There isn’t an “absolute physics”. There’s just the physics that we as observers extract from the ruliad. Much like there’s particular technology that we choose to build from the “raw material” that exists. Put another way, both physics and technology are ultimately things we “extract” from the ruliad, in effect by making certain choices.</p>\n<p>How we “extract” physics seems, however, much more constrained. For example, we as humans have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>only certain particular senses</a> through which we are biologically set up to experience the world. Yet we have the feeling that in technology we can in effect “construct whatever we want”—although inevitably “what we want” is also still at least influenced by how we are biologically set up.</p>\n<p>We’re very used to the idea that over time technology progresses—as we invent more, and work out new ways to use our “raw material” to achieve human purposes. But physics as a science progresses too. And in a sense what’s happening there is that we’re expanding our character as observers to be able to perceive and experience more of “what’s going on”—ultimately in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>Part of that expansion is actually a matter of technology. We’re building telescopes and microscopes and amplifiers that allow us to extend our raw human senses to be sensitive to more things. But there’s also another part of the expansion that is in effect intellectual: we’re developing new conceptual frameworks that allow us to “corral” things we see happening in the world into forms that “fit narratives” we’ve constructed.</p>\n<p>And the important point here is that neither our technology nor our physics is fixed. They’re in a sense co-evolving—gradually allowing more and more of the ruliad to be pulled into our narratives and our purposes. Or, put another way, what we observe is gradually expanding to encompass more and more of the ruliad, and to be able to make use of more and more of it. </p>\n<h2 id='reaching-out-across-rulial-space'>Reaching Out across Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>How are “different intelligences” manifest in the ruliad? We can imagine organizing the ruliad to be <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>laid out in some form of rulial space</a>. And from each point in rulial space one in effect gets a “different perspective” on the ruliad. And that&#8217;s at least the beginning of the story of how &#8220;different intelligences&#8221; exist and experience the ruliad.</p>\n<p>It’s similar to what happens with physical space: from different places in physical space one gets a different perspective on the universe. In physical space we have a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>concept of motion</a>: that observers like us can move from one place in space to another while in effect maintaining our coherence and integrity. </p>\n<p>How does this work in rulial space? We can think of different points in rulial space as corresponding to different computations, with different rules. So <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space'>rulial motion</a> in effect corresponds to making a translation between one computation and another. At the outset, it’s not obvious this would even in principle be possible. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies that it ultimately will be. The computations at different points in rulial space will (almost always) be equivalent in their sophistication—and as is typical with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>universal computation</a>—it’ll therefore in principle be possible to have an “interpretation process” that translates between them.</p>\n<p>But the big question is whether this can be achieved in practice. Just how far can a particular observer translate in rulial space while <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#what-can-human-mathematics-be-like'>maintaining their coherence and integrity</a>? </p>\n<p>The ruliad is a complex and (if sampled across slices in time) continually changing thing. But a critical feature is that there can be structures that have a certain persistence within it. In physical space these are things like particles (as well as black holes) that behave like “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>stable lumps of space</a>”—or like stable lumps in certain projections of the ruliad. In rulial space there can presumably also be structures with a certain persistence: <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space'>&#8220;particles&#8221; of rulial space</a>. And these “particles” somehow correspond to features that “survive across different computational perspectives”—or in effect represent “robust concepts”.</p>\n<p>When we talk about “different intelligences” a very familiar example is different human minds. And in a sense we can think of different human minds as being laid out in rulial space—with each mind being at a different rulial position, and thus having a different computational rule by which it operates, and a different “experience of the ruliad”. </p>\n<p>So how can these minds “communicate”? Ultimately it is through “rulial motion”. But potentially the most robust form of rulial motion is through rulial particles—which we’ve identified above with the abstract idea of “robust concepts”. Put in a practical way: different (human) minds operate internally in different ways. But they can still “communicate” by exchanging something that in effect “survives translation” between one mind and another: rulial particles corresponding to robust concepts (say expressed in a language).</p>\n<p>But, OK, we can imagine rulial space with lots of human minds laid out at different places, with ones that communicate more easily closer together. So what about “alien intelligences”? Well, each one is somewhere in rulial space. But they may be far away from where our human minds are.</p>\n<p>We can imagine our rulial particles—or “robust concepts”—being able to reach a certain distance in rulial space. The human idea of “excitement” might for example be able to reach the place in rulial space where we’d find the minds of dogs. But what about the weather, for example? Well, as an alien intelligence, it’s presumably much further away in rulial space—and, anthropomorphize it as we might—it’s not clear what its notion of “excitement” would be.</p>\n<p>It’s an often-asked question why—with our spacecraft and radio telescopes and everything else—we haven’t ever run across what we consider to be “naturally occurring” alien intelligences. In the past we might have imagined that the answer is that there just isn’t anything like “intelligence” (outside of us humans) to be found in any part of the universe that we can probe. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> says that’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>fundamentally not true</a>, and that in fact “abstract intelligence” is thoroughly ubiquitous among systems with all but the most obviously simple behavior. </p>\n<p>So to “find” alien intelligence it’s not that we need a more powerful radio telescope (or a better spacecraft) that can reach further in physical space. Rather, the issue is to be able to reach far enough in rulial space. Or, put another way, even if we view the weather as “having a mind of its own”, the rulial distance between “its mind” and our human minds may be too great for us to be able to “understand” and “communicate with it”. </p>\n<p>So what will it take for us to “bridge this rulial gap”? At some level it’s just about building the right science and technology. We can think of science as being about defining a way to “translate” from the computational rules by which some particular system operates to the computational way our human minds operate. Or, in terms of rulial space, finding a way to “move” from the rulial position of the system to the rulial position of our minds—and translating from the way a system works to a “human narrative” that represents it.</p>\n<p>Centuries ago we might have just said “the planets do what they do”; maybe their motion in space is driven by an “alien intelligence” that we don’t understand. But then <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>along came mathematical science</a> and we were able to “translate” from the intrinsic computation done by the planets to a mathematical description that we internalized enough to consider it a human narrative that we understand.</p>\n<p>In some sense at any given time in intellectual history our minds “reach out a certain distance in rulial space”. We’ve developed conceptual frameworks that allow us to maintain a coherent understanding of a certain range of things—with that range growing as we invent new frameworks. At one time our “domain of understanding”—or the region of rulial space that we could reach—didn’t encompass the behavior of electricity. But our “intellectual expansion” in rulial space eventually reached this, and the result is that we can now use electricity as “raw material” from which to construct technology.</p>\n<p>One way we “expand our reach in rulial space” is in effect conceptual: by expanding what we understand. But another way is by being able to “sense” or “measure” more. When we invent radio—or, for that matter, gravitational wave detection—there are immediately new kinds of processes that we manage to “connect to human experience”. Or, put another way, there are more distant parts of the ruliad that we’re able to reach.</p>\n<p>More prosaically, we can say that if we want to be able to use something for technology, we’d better be able to detect that it’s there, and we’d better be able to understand it well enough that we can see how it could align with our human purposes. We can think of the ruliad as being full of alien intelligences—with plenty of capabilities to “mine”. But to be able to actually mine something for our technological purposes we have to be able to reach it across rulial space; we have to be able to connect it to us.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for the original startup pitch? Yes, it’s a good idea to “mine alien intelligences” for technology. In fact, that’s basically where technology always comes from. But there’s no need to send out spacecraft, “discover” alien intelligence, and so on. There are “alien intelligences” all around us; the issue is just to reach them across rulial space, and be able to “communicate” with them. But what we’ve argued is that the process of progressively reaching out in rulial space is just the general process of progressively advancing science (and the technology on which it depends).</p>\n<p>So, yes, by all means explore more of what’s out there in the world, with more, different kinds of sensors and measurements. Then try to “understand” what you see enough to be able to tell how to align it with human purposes, and make technology out of it. But there’s no pressing need for interstellar spacecraft in this picture. It’s just a matter of doing more science to expand our domain in the ruliad, and mine more of rulial space.</p>\n<h2 id='the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>The Evolution of Purpose and the Colonization of Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>We can think of technology as being about setting up things that exist in the world (or ultimately in the ruliad) to achieve human purposes. And we’ve talked about how the advance of science and technology allows us to progressively reach further in rulial space to get “raw material” for our technology. But we’ve said that technology is intended to “achieve human purposes”. So what might those purposes ultimately be?</p>\n<p>Our purposes have certainly evolved over the course of human history. In today’s world, we might view it as purposeful to walk on a treadmill, or to trade cryptocurrencies. But it would be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/#aliens-and-the-philosophy-of-purpose'>challenging to explain the purpose</a> of such things to someone from even a few hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>In a sense, purposes evolve as we build new conceptual frameworks, and as we set up technology that allows us to do new things. More abstractly, we might say that purposes are also something defined by places in rulial space. So when we talk about the evolution of purposes, what we’re really asking is where in rulial space our history and development has led us, and will lead us in the future.</p>\n<p>And certainly in the vastness of the whole ruliad, our existing human purposes occupy just an infinitesimally tiny part. Think, for example, of the natural world even as we are currently aware of it. The vast majority of things in it do not seem in any way aligned with our purposes—and we have not been able to mine them for technology. Historically, however, there’s been progressive expansion in the domain of our purposes. There was a time when we knew about magnetic rocks, but had no purpose for magnetism. But over the course of time, from compasses to actuators to memories, more and more human purposes have emerged that connect to the phenomenon of magnetism.</p>\n<p>And in a sense we can view the whole core trajectory of human progress as being about the expansion of the region of rulial space—and the ruliad—that represents our purposes. So how will this evolve?</p>\n<p>As I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>discussed extensively before</a>, there seem to be two central features that we as entities in the ruliad have. First, that we are computationally bounded. And second, that we believe we are persistent in time. Computational boundedness is essentially the statement that the region of rulial space that we occupy is limited. In some sense our minds can coherently span a certain region of rulial space, but it’s a bounded region. </p>\n<p>What about persistence in time? It means that even though we are always being reconstructed out of different atoms of existence (and different atoms of space), we conflate things to the point where we experience a single continuous thread of existence.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these features suggest a picture of us being a kind of “blob” that gradually <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>moves around</a> in rulial space. Does it matter that there isn’t just a single human mind? Well, yes. Without some kind of “observer” there’s no real way to even define what it means to have a “blob”. And in the end it’s a story of consistency of observers observing observers. But the result is that we can think of our whole collective “flotilla” of human purposes as being something localized that moves around in rulial space, expanding the region of the ruliad that it reaches.</p>\n<p>But just how far can this go? Imagine that at some time in the distant future we have successfully explored—and “colonized”—much of rulial space. To do this we’d certainly have to have broken out of the particular constraints of our biological construction, and made use of “additional raw material” in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>But what would it mean to be spread across a large swath of rulial space? Our very notion of existence seems to depend on localization in rulial space. The thing that we view as “us” is something particular and coherent. To be “bigger” in rulial space is to deny that particularity and coherence, and to become something generic that does not represent any kind of “specific entity that exists”.</p>\n<p>In a sense, it’s a pyrrhic view of the ultimate limit of our technological and other evolution. As we progress, we gradually “mine” more and more of the ruliad, pulling it into the domain of technology and of our “human” (or post-human) purposes. But in doing so, we eventually transcend the very characteristics that we identify with existence. In other words, if we go too far with our expansion in the ruliad, we simply cease to exist, at least in the sense that we currently define existence. </p>\n<p>Put another way, if we “absorb” more and more “alien intelligence” there’s eventually no longer any coherent “us”. Of course, the very notion of coherence is something we’re basically defining from our current human view of things. And no doubt there are other definitions that could be given. But they’re certainly far away from our current place in rulial space, and it’s not even clear they can be reached without some kind of “discontinuity of motion” that would in effect fundamentally break their connection to us as we are now.</p>\n<h2 id='face-to-face-with-alien-intelligence,-out-in-rulial-space'>Face to Face with Alien Intelligence, Out in Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>At a fundamental level, the ruliad is a purely computational object, that we can think of as being made of pure, abstract atoms of existence (or “emes”). When observers like us sample the ruliad we can attribute to it the characteristics that correspond to our perception of physical reality. And a notable feature of that sampling is that it supports the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>idea of pure motion</a> in physical space. In other words, it allows for the possibility that structures can “maintain their perceived physical integrity” while being “re-formed” out of different atoms of space, which themselves are interpretations of the pure atoms of existence in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But as soon as we start thinking about any kind of serious motion in rulial (rather than physical) space it no longer makes sense to talk about anything like “maintaining physical integrity”, not least because in different places in rulial space the very notion of physics changes. But wherever we are in the ruliad we can still think about what’s going on as computation. We might have some way of observing or sampling the ruliad that gives us some perception of reality—like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>physics</a>, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>mathematics</a>. But if we “atomize” things down to the lowest level, we’ll always find raw computation.</p>\n<p>As “physical observers like us” we only have limited capabilities to probe or manipulate the raw ruliad and affect what we perceive as physical reality. We can move physical objects around, maintaining what we observe of their structure. In principle we could <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/'>imagine deconstructing objects</a> into individual atoms of existence, then recreating them “transporter style” somewhere else in physical space. But as of now, we don’t know how to do this, and most likely it’s not possible for observers like us—because it would require “outcomputing” computationally irreducible features of the structure of space down at the level of individual atoms of space, which is far from what computationally bounded observers like us can expect to do.</p>\n<p>But what about raw computation, of the kind that ultimately makes up the ruliad? There the story is different. Because we’re no longer constrained by our character as physical observers, so we’re free to in effect “make up any computation we want”. To explore the physical universe we need physical motion or something like it. And at least for observers like us the only way to achieve this seems to be to progressively move structures across physical space. But to find out what can happen in the computational universe we can effectively just write down any rule (i.e. any program) that appears “anywhere in the ruliad”, and run it.</p>\n<p>Of course, when we run a rule on a practical computer, it’s just an emulation of what’s happening in the raw ruliad. But it’s just an abstract rule—so although it will run astronomically slower, its ultimate behavior in our emulation will inevitably be identical to what it is when implemented in terms of individual atoms of existence in the “raw ruliad”.</p>\n<p>In principle we could take the same approach in emulating the elements that make up our physical reality. But observers like us are so big relative to the raw elements of the ruliad that we can’t expect our emulations to be at a scale where we can faithfully reproduce what we perceive. (Needless to say, in practice we can still get good approximations, and this is a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/the-wolfram-physics-project-a-one-year-update/#towards-experimental-implications'>particularly fertile application of our Physics Project</a>.) </p>\n<p>But when we’re dealing with “raw computation” down at the lowest level of the raw ruliad, we can expect to faithfully emulate it. And so it is that we can just pick a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave'>cellular automaton</a> or a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machine</a> or some other kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>computational system</a>—that in effect comes from anywhere in the ruliad—and emulate it to find out what it does. There’s no “object we have to move” to be able to “look at that part of the ruliad”. We’re emulating things down at the level of individual atoms of existence, and seeing what happens.</p>\n<p>We can think about our computational experiments as letting us “jump” to find out what it’s like anywhere in the ruliad. And as we “suddenly materialize” somewhere in the ruliad it’s as if we’re immediately “face to face” with whatever “alien intelligence” there is at that place in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But what can “observers like us” expect to make of that alien intelligence? Well, to be able “communicate” or even “relate” we somehow have to be able to “bridge the gap in rulial space”. And since we just “jumped to a place in rulial space” we don’t immediately have any “progressive path” that “incrementally” takes us from our familiar position in rulial space to wherever the alien intelligence is.</p>\n<p>But what does that feel like in practice? The whole idea of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a> is just to go anywhere we want in the computational universe or in the ruliad, and see what happens when we run the rules we find there. And it’s indeed routine to find that what they do seems quite “alien”. Still, they often have certain essential features that for example remind us of the natural world as we observe it. But our standard methods of science (and mathematics)—developed on the basis of being “observers like we are today”—don’t readily allow us to “understand” the behavior of these systems chosen in the course of doing ruliology. To us they usually just seem to be “showing <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>”, and behaving in ways that we can effectively get no handle on. </p>\n<p>But still, we can in a sense view these programs “out there in the computational universe” (and in effect strewn around the ruliad) as showing us what’s possible. They’re like alien intelligences that we know exist, but that we don’t yet understand, and don’t yet know how to harness or relate to. We can see them as some kind of beacons of possible technology of the future—of things that “exist in the ruliad”, but that we haven’t yet been able to connect to human purposes.</p>\n<p>But so how might we make this connection? Well, as it happens, I’ve devoted much of my life to what can be viewed as the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>construction of a systematic bridge</a> between what’s “computationally possible” and what we humans think of as important. For that’s the story of what I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a>—and indeed of the whole intellectual structure that is the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s infinite potential content in the ruliad. But one can view the goal of the Wolfram Language as being to represent—in a way that’s optimized for us humans to understand—those parts that we humans consider important. The language lets us use the concepts of computation not only to crystallize our existing thinking, but also to expand what we can think about, in effect letting us reach out further in rulial space. Computational language is the general way that we “tame the ruliad”—extend the frontier of “human colonization” in the ruliad, and in the end “mine” more and more of the ruliad for “useful technology”.</p>\n<p>Just in terms of its practical place in the world today I’ve often said that the Wolfram Language is like an “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/our-mission-and-the-opportunity-of-artifacts-from-the-future/'>artifact from the future</a>”. But now we see a deep sense in which this is true. The raw ruliad is just “out there”, with “infinite potential”, but as something whose fundamental character has nothing to do with us humans. But what computational language is about is delivering what one can think of as the ultimate “meta-artifact”: something that progressively turns the raw ruliad into “human-recognizable technology”. </p>\n<p>Much of this progress involves the <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>specific, systematic design</a> of the Wolfram Language. But there are also forays that in effect jump further out into rulial space. For example, we’ve often enumerated large collections of simple programs, identifying ones that satisfy a certain criterion. And sometimes that feels a lot like “leveraging alien intelligence” without “understanding” it. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>rule 30 cellular automaton</a>, for example, is a good pseudorandom generator, even though we <a href='https://www.rule30prize.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>don&#8217;t really &#8220;understand&#8221;</a> even fairly basic things about it.</p>\n<p>And, yes, computational language is what we need to concretely “state a criterion”, in effect expressing what we’re thinking about in computational terms—that we can use, for example, to let us explicitly search the ruliad for an “alien intelligence” that does what we want.</p>\n<p>What does it look like out in the “raw ruliad”? It’s easy to start just looking at simple programs, say picked at random. And, yes, they have all sorts of elaborate behavior:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img5b.png\" alt='' title='' width='452' height='360' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622AIimg5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But what is this behavior “achieving”? Yes, it’s following the particular underlying rules that have been given. But we don’t have any immediate way to connect it to “human purposes”. And in general we can expect that to make that connection what’s needed is for those purposes themselves to “expand”.</p>\n<p>Maybe at some moment we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/music-mathematica-and-the-computational-universe/'>call what&#8217;s produced &#8220;art&#8221;</a>, and assign it some “aesthetic purpose”. Maybe at some point we see that it satisfies some engineering purpose that we’ve just realized we should care about. But in general, computational language is the way we can make the connection between “raw computational processes” out there in the ruliad, and our patterns of thinking about things. It’s the ultimate way for us to “communicate with alien intelligence”. </p>\n<h2 id='the-launch-of-a-rulial-space-program'>The Launch of a Rulial Space Program</h2>\n<p>We began with the far-out startup pitch of sending spacecraft to discover alien intelligence and bring its technology back to Earth. But what we’ve realized is that actually no spacecraft—of the ordinary kind—are needed. There’s “alien intelligence” to be found everywhere; you don’t have to travel to interstellar space to find it. But the challenge is to connect the “alien intelligence” to human purposes, and extract from it what we consider “useful technology”. Or, put another way, the issue is not about traversing physical space, but rather about traversing rulial space.</p>\n<p>With our spacecraft we humans have so far reached about a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28distance+to+furthest+manmade+object%29%2F%28radius+of+the+universe%29'>20-trillionth of the way across the physical universe</a>. But no doubt we’ve reached a far smaller fraction of the way across the ruliad. As our science, knowledge and technology increase, we gradually reach further into rulial space. But whether it’s our failure to communicate with cetaceans or our inability to make computers out of, say, fluids, it’s clear that by many measures the distance we’ve gone so far is not so large.</p>\n<p>In a sense the startup idea of “harnessing alien intelligence” is the meta-idea of all technology—that in our terms we can state as being to connect what’s “computationally possible” in the ruliad with purposes we humans want to achieve. And I’ve argued that the ultimate meta-technology for doing this is not spacecraft but computational language. Because computational language is what we need to make a bridge between what we care about, and “raw computation” out in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to send physical spacecraft out into interstellar space. But it’s actually a lot easier to probe the much richer possibilities of the ruliad—because in a sense it’s straightforward to put a “rulial spacecraft” anywhere. We just have to pick a rule (or program), then see what the “world” it generates is. But the challenge is then in a sense one of interpretation. What is happening in that world? Can we relate it to things we care about?</p>\n<p>At the outset, all we’re likely to see at some “random place” in the ruliad is rampant computational irreducibility. But it’s a fundamental fact that wherever there’s computational irreducibility, there must also be slices of computational reducibility to be found. In the ordinary physical universe that we experience, those are basically our perceived laws of physics. But even in a random sample of the ruliad we can expect there’ll be computational reducibility to be found. It’ll typically be “alien stuff”, though. It might have the character of science, but it won’t be like our existing science. And most likely it won’t align with anything we currently think we care about.</p>\n<p>But that is the great challenge and promise of mounting a “rulial space program”. To be confronted not with what we might recognize as “new life and new civilizations”, but with things for which we have no description and no current way of thinking. Perhaps we might view it merely as humbling to encounter such things, and to realize how small a part of the ruliad we yet understand. But we can also view it as a beacon of where we could go. And we can view a whole “rulial space program” as a way of systematizing the ultimate project of exploring all formally possible processes.

But what&#8217;s become increasingly clear—particularly in the last few years—is that it&#8217;s actually even much more important than I ever imagined. My <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>original goal</a> in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was to take a step beyond the mathematical paradigm that had defined the state of the art in science for three centuries—and to introduce a new paradigm based on computation and on the exploration of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>computational universe of possible programs</a>. And already in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> one can see that there&#8217;s immense richness to what can be done with this new paradigm. <span id=\"more-36963\"></span></p>\n<p>There’s a new abstract basic science—that I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>now call ruliology</a>—that’s concerned with studying the detailed properties of systems with simple rules. There’s a vast new source of “raw material” to “mine” from the computational universe, both for making models of things and for developing technology. And there are new, computational ways to think about fundamental features of how systems in nature and elsewhere work.</p>\n<p>But what’s now becoming clear is that there’s actually something still bigger, still more overarching that the paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> lays the foundations for. In a sense, <em>A New Kind of Science</em> defines how one can use computation to think about things. But what we’re now realizing is that actually computation is not just a way to think about things: it is at a very fundamental level what everything actually is. </p>\n<p>One can see this as a kind of ultimate limit of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. What we call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a> is the entangled limit of all possible computations. And what we, for example, experience as physical reality is in effect just our particular sampling of the ruliad. And it’s the ideas of <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>and particularly things like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>—that lay the foundations for understanding how this works.</p>\n<p>When I wrote <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>discussed the possibility</a> that there might be a way to find a fundamental model of physics based on simple programs. And from that seed has now come the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>, which, with its broad connections to existing mathematical physics, now seems to show that, yes, it&#8217;s really true that our physical universe is “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>computational all the way down</a>”. </p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s more. It&#8217;s not just that at the lowest level there&#8217;s some specific rule operating on a vast network of atoms of space. It&#8217;s that underneath everything is all possible computation, encapsulated in the single unique construct that is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. And what determines our experience—and the science we use to summarize it—is what characteristics we as observers have in sampling the ruliad. </p>\n<p>There is a tower of ideas that relate to fundamental questions about the nature of existence, and the foundations not only of physics, but also of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>mathematics</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>computer science</a> and a host of other fields. And these ideas build crucially on the paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. But they need something else as well: what I now call the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>. There were hints of it in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> when I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>discussed multiway systems</a>. But it has only been within the past couple of years that this whole new paradigm has begun to come into focus. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I explored some of the remarkable things that individual computations out in the computational universe can do. What the multicomputational paradigm now does is to consider the aggregate of multiple computations—and in the end the entangled limit of all possible computations, the ruliad.</p>\n<p>The Principle of Computational Equivalence is in many ways the intellectual culmination of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>—and it has many deep consequences. And one of them is the idea—and uniqueness—of the ruliad. The Principle of Computational Equivalence provides a very general statement about what all possible computational systems do. What the ruliad then does is to pull together the behaviors and relationships of all these systems into a single object that is, in effect, an ultimate representation of everything computational, and indeed in a certain sense simply of everything. </p>\n<h2 id='the-intellectual-journey:-from-physics-to-physics,-and-beyond'>The Intellectual Journey: From Physics to Physics, and Beyond</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> 20 years ago</a> was for me already the culmination of an <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/'>intellectual journey</a> that had begun more than 25 years earlier. I had started in theoretical physics as a teenager in the 1970s. And stimulated by my needs in physics, I had then <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>built my first computational language</a>. A couple of years later I returned to basic science, now interested in some very fundamental questions. And from my blend of experience in physics and computing I was led to start trying to formulate things in terms of computation, and computational experiments. And soon <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>discovered the remarkable fact</a> that in the computational universe, even very simple programs can generate immensely complex behavior.</p>\n<p>For several years I <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>studied the basic science</a> of the particular class of simple programs known as <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave'>cellular automata</a>—and the things I saw led me to identify some important general phenomena, most notably <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>. Then in 1986—having “answered most of the obvious questions I could see”—I left basic science again, and for five years concentrated on <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>creating Mathematica</a> and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. But in 1991 I took the tools I’d built, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>again immersed myself in basic science</a>. The decade that followed brought a long string of exciting and unexpected discoveries about the computational universe and its implications—leading finally in 2002 to the publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is a very complete book—that in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/colophon/'>its 1280 pages</a> does well at “answering all the obvious questions”, save, notably, for some about the “application area” of fundamental physics. For a couple of years after the book was published, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#please-dont-do-that-project'>I continued to explore some of these remaining questions</a>. But pretty soon I was swept up in the building of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> and then the Wolfram Language, and in all the complicated and often deep questions involved in for the first time creating a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>full-scale computational language</a>. And so for nearly 17 years I did almost no basic science. </p>\n<p>The ideas of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> nevertheless continued to exert a deep influence—and I came to see my decades of work on computational language as ultimately being about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/'>creating a bridge</a> between the vast capabilities of the computational universe revealed by <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and the specific kinds of ways we humans are able to think about things. This point of view led me to all kinds of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>important conclusions</a> about the role of computation and its implications for the future. But through all this I kept on thinking that one day I should look at physics again. And finally in 2019, stimulated by a small technical breakthrough, as well as enthusiasm from physicists of a new generation, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>I decided it was time to try diving into physics again</a>.</p>\n<p>My <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/'>practical tools</a> had developed a lot since I’d worked on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And—as I have found so often—the passage of years had given me greater clarity and perspective about what I’d discovered in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And it turned out we were rather quickly able to make spectacular progress. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> had <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>introduced definite ideas about how fundamental physics might work</a>. Now we could see that these ideas were very much on the right track, but on their own they did not go far enough. Something else was needed. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d introduced what I called <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a>, but I’d treated them as a kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-11--uniqueness-and-branching-in-time'>sideshow</a>. Now—particularly <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>tipped off by quantum mechanics</a>—we realized that multiway systems were not a sideshow but were actually in a sense the main event. They had come out of the computational paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, but they were really harbingers of a new paradigm: the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I’d already talked about space—and everything else in the universe—ultimately being <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-7--space-as-a-network'>made up of a network of discrete elements</a> that I’d now call “atoms of space”. And I’d talked about time being associated with the inexorable progressive application of computationally irreducible rules. But now we were thinking not just of a single thread of computation, but instead of a whole multiway system of branching and merging threads—representing in effect a multicomputational history for the universe. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d devoted a whole chapter to “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>Processes of Perception and Analysis</a>”, recognizing the importance of the observer in computational systems. But with multicomputation there was yet more focus on this, and on how a physical observer knits things together to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>form a coherent thread of experience</a>. Indeed, it became clear that it’s certain features of the observer that ultimately determine the laws of physics we perceive. And in particular it seems that as soon as we—somehow reflecting core <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>features of our conscious experience</a>—believe that we exist persistently through time, but are computationally bounded, then it follows that we will attribute to the universe the central known laws of spacetime and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>At the level of atoms of space and individual threads of history everything is full of computational irreducibility. But the key point is that observers like us don’t experience this; instead we sample certain computationally reducible features—that we can describe in terms of meaningful “laws of physics”.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/1-inset-phyzA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"163\" height=\"134\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>I never expected it would be so easy, but by early 2020—only a few months into our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>—we seemed to have successfully identified how the “machine code” of our universe must work. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> had established that computation was a powerful way of thinking about things. But now it was becoming clear that actually our whole universe is in a sense “computational all the way down”. </p>\n<p>But where did this leave the traditional mathematical view? To my surprise, far from being at odds it seemed as if our computation-all-the-way-down model of physics perfectly plugged into a great many of the more abstract existing mathematical approaches. Mediated by multicomputation, the concepts of <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>which began as an effort to go beyond mathematics—seemed now to be finding a kind of ultimate convergence with mathematics.</p>\n<p>But despite our success in working out the structure of the “machine code” for our universe, a major mystery remained. Let’s say we could find a particular rule that could generate everything in our universe. Then we’d have to ask “Why this rule, and not another?” And if “our rule” was simple, how come we’d “lucked out” like that? Ever since I was working on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/09/my-hobby-hunting-for-our-universe/'>wondered about this</a>.</p>\n<p>And just as we were getting ready to announce the Physics Project in May 2020 the answer <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#why-this-universe-the-relativity-of-rules'>began to emerge</a>. It came out of the multicomputational paradigm. And in a sense it was an ultimate version of it. Instead of imagining that the universe follows some particular rule—albeit applying it multicomputationally in all possible ways—what if the universe follows all possible rules? </p>\n<p>And then we realized: this is something much more general than physics. And in a sense it’s the ultimate computational construct. It’s what one gets if one takes all the programs in the computational universe that I studied in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and runs them together—as a single, giant, multicomputational system. It’s a single, unique object that I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, formed as the entangled limit of all possible computations.</p>\n<p>There’s no choice about the ruliad. Everything about it is abstractly necessary—emerging as it does just from the formal concept of computation. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> developed the abstraction of thinking about things in terms of computation. The ruliad takes this to its ultimate limit—capturing the whole entangled structure of all possible computations—and defining an object that in some sense describes everything.</p>\n<p>Once we believe—as the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies—that things like our universe are computational, it then inevitably follows that they are described by the ruliad. But the observer has a crucial role here. Because while as a matter of theoretical science we can discuss the whole ruliad, our experience of it inevitably has to be based on sampling it according to our actual capabilities of perception.</p>\n<p>In the end, it’s deeply analogous to something that—as <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>I mention in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>—first got me interested in fundamental questions in science 50 years ago: the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>. The molecules in a gas move around and interact according to certain rules. But as <em>A New Kind of Science</em> argues, one can think about this as a computational process, which can show computational irreducibility. If one didn’t worry about the “mechanics” of the observer, one might imagine that one could readily “see through” this computational irreducibility, to the detailed behavior of the molecules underneath. But the point is that a realistic, computationally bounded observer—like us—will be forced by computational irreducibility to perceive only certain “coarse-grained” aspects of what’s going on, and so will consider the gas to be behaving in a standard large-scale thermodynamic way. </p>\n<p>And so it is, at a grander level, with the ruliad. Observers like us can only perceive certain aspects of what’s going on in the ruliad, and a key result of our Physics Project is that with only quite loose constraints on what we’re like as observers, it’s inevitable that we will perceive our universe to operate according to particular precise known laws of physics. And indeed the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>attributes that we associate with “consciousness”</a> seem closely tied to what’s needed to get the features of spacetime and quantum mechanics that we know from physics. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> one of the conclusions is that the Principle of Computational Equivalence <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>implies a fundamental equivalence between systems (like us)</a> that we consider “intelligent” or “conscious”, and systems that we consider “merely computational”. </p>\n<p>But what’s now become clear in the multicomputational paradigm is that there’s more to this story. It’s not (as people have often assumed) that there’s something more powerful about “conscious observers” like us. Actually, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>it&#8217;s rather the opposite</a>: that in order to have consistent “conscious experience” we have to have certain limitations (in particular, computational boundedness, and a belief of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>persistence in time</a>), and these limitations are what make us “see the ruliad” in the way that corresponds to our usual view of the physical world.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 7px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/2-inset-ultimate-universe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"131\" height=\"117\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad is a powerful one, with implications that significantly transcend the traditional boundaries of science. For example, last year I realized that thinking in terms of the ruliad potentially provides a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>meaningful answer to the ultimate question of why our universe exists</a>. The answer, I posit, is that the ruliad—as a “purely formal” object—“necessarily exists”. And what we perceive as “our universe” is then just the “slice” that corresponds to what we can “see” from the particular place in “rulial space” at which we happen to be. There has to be “something there”—and the remarkable fact is that for an observer with our general characteristics, that something has to have features that are like our usual laws of physics.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I discussed how the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>almost any system can be thought of as being “like a mind”</a> (as in, “the weather has a mind of its own”). But the issue—that for example is of central importance in talking about extraterrestrial intelligence—is how similar to us that mind is. And now with the ruliad we have a more definite way to discuss this. Different minds (even different human ones) can be thought of as being at different places in the ruliad, and thus in effect attributing different rules to the universe. The Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that there must ultimately be a way to translate (or, in effect, move) from one place to another. But the question is how far it is. </p>\n<p>Our senses and measuring devices—together with our general paradigms for thinking about things—define the basic area over which our understanding extends, and for which we can readily produce a high-level narrative description of what’s going on. And in the past we might have assumed that this was all we’d ever need to reach with whatever science we built. But what <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>and now the ruliad—show us is that there’s much more out there. There’s a whole computational universe of possible programs—many of which behave in ways that are far from our current domain of high-level understanding.</p>\n<p>Traditional science we can view as operating by gradually expanding our domain of understanding. But in a sense the key methodological idea that launched <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is to do computational experiments, which in effect just “jump without prior understanding” out into the wilds of the computational universe. And that’s in the end why <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>all that ruliology</a> in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> at first looks so alien: we’ve effectively jumped quite far from our familiar place in rulial space, so there’s no reason to expect we’ll recognize anything. And in effect, as the title of the book says, we need to be doing a new kind of science.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, an important part of the story has to do with the phenomenon of computational irreducibility, and the way in which it prevents any computationally bounded observer (like us) from being able to “reduce” the behavior of systems, and thereby perceive them as anything other than complex. But now that we’re thinking not just about computation, but about multicomputation, other attributes of other observers start to be important too. And with the ruliad ultimately representing everything, the question of what will be perceived in any particular case devolves into one about the characteristics of observers.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I give examples of how the same kinds of simple programs (such as cellular automata) can <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>provide good “metamodels” for a variety of kinds of systems</a> in nature and elsewhere, that show up in very different areas of science. But one feature of different areas of science is that they’re often concerned with different kinds of questions. And with the focus on the characteristics of the observer this is something we get to capture—and we get to discuss, for example, what the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemical observer</a>, or the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economic observer</a>, might be like, and how that affects their perception of what’s ultimately in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Chapter 12 of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> there’s a long section on “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-9--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations'>Implications for Mathematics and Its Foundations</a>”, which begins with the observation that just as many models in science seem to be able to start from simple rules, mathematics is traditionally specifically set up to start from simple axioms. I then analyzed how <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>multiway systems could be thought of as defining possible derivations</a> (or proofs) of new mathematical theorems from axioms or other theorems—and I discussed how the difficulty of doing mathematics can be thought of as a reflection of computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-inset-metamath-project.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"123\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But informed by our Physics Project I realized that there&#8217;s much more to say about the foundations of mathematics—and this has led to our recently launched <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>Metamathematics Project</a>. At the core of this project is the idea that mathematics, like physics, is ultimately just a sampling of the ruliad. And just as the ruliad defines the lowest-level machine code of physics, so does it also for mathematics.</p>\n<p>The traditional axiomatic level of mathematics (with its built-in notions of variables and operators and so on) is already higher level than the “raw ruliad”. And a crucial observation is that just like physical observers operate at a level far above things like the atoms of space, so “mathematical observers” mostly operate at a level far above the raw ruliad, or even the “assembly code” of axioms. In an analogy with gases, the ruliad—or even axiom systems—are talking about the “molecular dynamics” level; but “mathematical observers” operate more at the “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>And the result of this is what I call the physicalization of metamathematics: the realization that our “perception” of mathematics is like our perception of physics. And that, for example, the very possibility of consistently doing higher-level mathematics where we don&#8217;t always have to drop down to the level of axioms or the raw ruliad has the same origin as the fact that “observers like us” typically view space as something continuous, rather than something made up of lots of atoms of space.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p815--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>considered it a mystery</a> why phenomena like undecidability are not more common in typical pure mathematics. But now our Metamathematics Project provides an answer that&#8217;s based on the character of mathematical observers. </p>\n<p>My stated goal at the beginning of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was to go beyond the mathematical paradigm, and that&#8217;s exactly what was achieved. But now there&#8217;s almost a full circle—because we see that building on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and the computational paradigm we reach the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, and then we realize that mathematics, like physics, is part of the ruliad. Or, put another way, mathematics, like physics—and like everything else—is “made of computation”, and all computation is in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>And that means that insofar as we consider there to be physical reality, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>so also we must consider there to be “mathematical reality”</a>. Physical reality arises from the sampling of the ruliad by physical observers; so similarly mathematical reality must arise from the sampling of the ruliad by mathematical observers. Or, in other words, if we believe that the physical world exists, so we must—essentially like Plato—also believe that the mathematics exists, and that there is an underlying reality to mathematics.</p>\n<p>All of these ideas rest on what was achieved in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> but now go significantly beyond it. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#the-lost-epilog,-and-other-outtakes-from-the-book'>In an “Epilog” that I eventually cut</a> from the final version of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I speculated that “major new directions” might be built in 15–30 years. And when I wrote that, I wasn&#8217;t really expecting that I would be the one to be central in doing that. And indeed I suspect that had I simply continued the direct path in basic science defined by my work on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, it wouldn&#8217;t have been me. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve explicitly planned, but at this point I can look back on my life so far and see it as a repeated alternation between <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>technology</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>basic science</a>. Each builds on the other, giving me both ideas and tools—and creating in the end a taller and taller intellectual tower. But what&#8217;s crucial is that every alternation is in many ways a fresh start, where I&#8217;m able to use what I&#8217;ve done before, but have a chance to reexamine everything from a new perspective. And so it has been in the past few years with <em>A New Kind of Science</em>: having returned to basic science after 17 years away, it&#8217;s been possible to make remarkably rapid and dramatic progress that&#8217;s taken things to a new and wholly unexpected level. </p>\n<h2 id='the-arrival-of-a-fourth-scientific-paradigm'>The Arrival of a Fourth Scientific Paradigm</h2>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/4-inset-opening-sentence.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"124\" height=\"149\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In the course of intellectual history, there’ve been <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>very few fundamentally different paradigms</a> introduced for theoretical science. The first is what one might call the “structural paradigm”, in which one’s basically just concerned with what things are made of. And beginning in antiquity—and continuing for two millennia—this was pretty much the only paradigm on offer. But in the 1600s there was, as I described it in the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>opening sentence of<em> A New Kind of Science</a></em>, a “dramatic new idea”—that one could describe not just how things are, but also what they can do, in terms of mathematical equations.</p>\n<p>And for three centuries this “mathematical paradigm” defined the state of the art for theoretical science. But as I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>went on to explain in the opening paragraph of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, my goal was to develop a new “computational paradigm” that would describe things not in terms of mathematical equations but instead in terms of computational rules or programs. There’d been <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-1--the-foundations-for-a-new-kind-of-science#sect-1-4--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book'>precursors to this in my own work in the 1980s</a>, but despite the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>practical use of computers in applying the mathematical paradigm</a>, there wasn’t much of a concept of describing things, say in nature, in a fundamentally computational way.</p>\n<p>One feature of a mathematical equation is that it aims to encapsulate “in one fell swoop” the whole behavior of a system. Solve the equation and you’ll know everything about what the system will do. But in the computational paradigm it’s a different story. The underlying computational rules for a system in principle determine what it will do. But to actually find out what it does, you have to run those rules—which is often a computationally irreducible process. </p>\n<p>Put another way: in the structural paradigm, one doesn’t talk about time at all. In the mathematical paradigm, time is there, but it’s basically just a parameter, that if you can solve the equations you can set to whatever value you want. In the computational paradigm, however, time is something more fundamental: it’s associated with the actual irreducible progression of computation in a system.</p>\n<p>It’s an important distinction that cuts to the core of theoretical science. Heavily influenced by the mathematical paradigm, it’s often been assumed that science is fundamentally about being able to make predictions, or in a sense having a model that can “outrun” the system you’re studying, and say what it’s going to do with much less computational effort than the system itself. </p>\n<p>But <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> implies that there’s a fundamental limit to this. There are systems whose behavior is in effect “too complex” for us to ever be able to “find a formula for it”. And this is not something we could, for example, resolve just by increasing our mathematical sophistication: it is a fundamental limit that arises from the whole structure of the computational paradigm. In effect, from deep inside science we’re learning that there are <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-12--historical-perspectives'>fundamental limitations on what science can achieve</a>.</p>\n<p>But as I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-7--the-phenomenon-of-free-will'>mentioned in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, computational irreducibility has an upside as well. If everything were computationally reducible, the passage of time wouldn’t in any fundamental sense add up to anything; we’d always be able to “jump ahead” and see what the outcome of anything would be without going through the steps, and we’d never have something we could reasonably experience as free will.</p>\n<p>In practical computing it’s pretty common to want to go straight from “question” to “answer”, and not be interested in “what happened inside”. But in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> there is in a sense an immediate emphasis on “what happens inside”. I don’t just show the initial input and final output for a cellular automaton. I show its whole “spacetime” history. And now that we have a computational theory of fundamental physics we can see that all the richness of our physical experience is contained in the “process inside”. We don’t just want to know the endpoint of the universe; we want to live the ongoing computational process that corresponds to our experience of the passage of time.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/5-inset-multicomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"144\" height=\"128\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But, OK, so in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> we reached what we might identify as the third major paradigm for theoretical science. But the exciting—and surprising—thing is that inspired by our Physics Project we can now <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>see a fourth paradigm: the multicomputational paradigm</a>. And while the computational paradigm involves considering the progression of particular computations, the multicomputational paradigm involves considering the entangled progression of many computations. The computational paradigm involves a single thread of time. The multicomputational paradigm involves multiple threads of time that branch and merge.</p>\n<p>What in a sense forced us into the multicomputational paradigm was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>thinking about quantum mechanics in our Physics Project</a>, and realizing that multicomputation was inevitable in our models. But the idea of multicomputation is vastly more general, and in fact immediately applies to any system where at any given step multiple things can happen. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I studied many kinds of computational systems—like cellular automata and Turing machines—where one definite thing happens at each step. I looked a little at <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a>—primarily ones based on string rewriting. But now in general in the multicomputational paradigm one is interested in studying multiway systems of all kinds. They can be based on simple iterations, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>say involving numbers</a>, in which multiple functions can be applied at each step. They can be based on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#he-topology-of-proof-space'>systems like games</a> where there are multiple moves at each step. And they can be based on a whole range of systems in nature, technology and elsewhere where there are multiple <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/#asynchronous-updating'>“asynchronous” choices of events</a> that can occur.</p>\n<p>Given the basic description of multicomputational systems, one might at first assume that whatever difficulties there are in deducing the behavior of computational systems, they would only be greater for multicomputational systems. But the crucial point is that whereas with a purely computational system (like a cellular automaton) it’s perfectly reasonable to imagine “experiencing” its whole evolution—say just by seeing a picture of it, the same is not true of a multicomputational system. Because for observers like us, who fundamentally experience time in a single thread, we have no choice but to somehow “sample” or “coarse grain” a multicomputational system if we are to reduce its behavior to something we can “experience”. </p>\n<p>And there’s then a remarkable formal fact: if one has a system that shows fundamental computational irreducibility, then computationally bounded “single-thread-of-time” observers inevitably perceive certain effective behavior in the system, that follows something like the typical laws of physics. Once again we can make an analogy with gases made from large numbers of molecules. Large-scale (computationally bounded) observers will essentially inevitably perceive gases to follow, say, the standard gas laws, quite independent of the detailed properties of individual molecules. </p>\n<p>In other words, the interplay between an “observer like us” and a multicomputational system will effectively select out a slice of computational reducibility from the underlying computational irreducibility. And although I didn’t see this coming, it’s in the end fairly obvious that something like this has to happen. The Principle of Computational Equivalence makes it basically inevitable that the underlying processes in the universe will be computationally irreducible. But somehow the particular features of the universe that we perceive and care about have to be ones that have enough computational reducibility that we can, for example, make consistent decisions about what to do, and we’re not just continually confronted by irreducible unpredictability.</p>\n<p>So how general can we expect this picture of multicomputation to be, with its connection to the kinds of things we’ve seen in physics? It seems to be extremely general, and to provide a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>true fourth paradigm for theoretical science</a>. </p>\n<p>There are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>many kinds of systems</a> for which the multicomputational paradigm seems to be immediately relevant. Beyond physics and metamathematics, there seems to be near-term promise in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemistry</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular biology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#evolutionary-biology'>evolutionary biology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#neuroscience'>neuroscience</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#immunology'>immunology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics'>linguistics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#machine-learning'>machine learning</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#distributed-computing'>distributed computing</a> and more. In each case there are underlying low-level elements (such as molecules) that interact through some kind of events (say collisions or reactions). And then there’s a big question of what the relevant observer is like.</p>\n<p>In <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemistry</a>, for example, the observer could just measure the overall concentration of some kind of molecule, coarse-graining together all the individual instances of those molecules. Or the observer could be sensitive, for example, to detailed causal relationships between collisions among molecules. In traditional chemistry, things like this generally aren’t “observed”. But in biology (for example in connection with membranes), or in molecular computing, they may be crucial. </p>\n<p>When I began the project that became <em>A New Kind of Science</em> the central question I wanted to answer is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>why we see so much complexity</a> in so many kinds of systems. And with the computational paradigm and the ubiquity of computational irreducibility we had an answer, which also in a sense told us why it was difficult to make certain kinds of progress in a whole range of areas.</p>\n<p>But now we’ve got a new paradigm, the multicomputational paradigm. And the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#multicomputation-and-the-surprise-return-of-reducibility-'>big surprise</a> is that through the intermediation of the observer we can tap into computational reducibility, and potentially find “physics-like” laws for all sorts of fields. This may not work for the questions that have traditionally been asked in these fields. But the point is that with the “right kind of observer” there’s computational reducibility to be found. And that computational reducibility may be something we can tap into for understanding, or to use some kind of system for technology.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/6-inset-ruliad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"121\" height=\"126\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>It can all be seen as starting with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, and involving almost philosophical questions of what one can call “observer theory”. But in the end it gives us very practical ideas and methods that I think have the potential to lead to unexpectedly dramatic progress in a remarkable range of fields.</p>\n<p>I knew that <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would have practical applications, particularly in modeling, in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#a-world-of-discovered-technology'>technology</a> and in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/music-mathematica-and-the-computational-universe/'>producing creative material</a>. And indeed it has. But for our Physics Project applications seemed much further away, perhaps centuries. But a great surprise has been that through the multicomputational paradigm it seems as if there are going to be some quite immediate and very practical applications of the Physics Project.</p>\n<p>In a sense the reason for this is that through the intermediation of multicomputation we see that many kinds of systems share the same underlying “metastructure”. And this means that as soon as there are things to say about one kind of system these can be applied to other systems. And in particular the great successes of physics can be applied to a whole range of systems that share the same multicomputational metastructure.</p>\n<p>An immediate example is in practical computing, and particularly in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. It’s something of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#the-beginning-of-the-story'>personal irony</a> that the Wolfram Language is based on transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which is a structure very similar to what ends up being what’s involved in the Physics Project. But there’s a crucial difference: in the usual case of the Wolfram Language, everything works in a purely computational way, with a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#the-question-of-evaluation-order'>particular transformation being done at each step</a>. But now there’s the potential to generalize that to the multicomputational case, and in effect to trace the multiway system of every possible transformation.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to pick out of that structure things that we can readily understand. But there are important lessons from physics for this. And as we build out the multicomputational capabilities of the Wolfram Language I fully expect that the “notational clarity” it will bring will help us to formulate much more in terms of the multicomputational paradigm.</p>\n<p>I built the Wolfram Language as a tool that would help me explore the computational paradigm, and from that paradigm there emerged principles like the Principle of Computational Equivalence, which in turn led me to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2009/05/7-years-of-nks-and-its-first-killer-app/'>see the possibility</a> of something like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>. But now from the latest basic science built on the foundations of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, together with the practical tooling of the Wolfram Language, it’s becoming possible again to see how to make conceptual advances that can drive technology that will again in turn let us make—likely dramatic—progress in basic science. </p>\n<h2 id='harvesting-seeds-from-a-new-kind-of-science'>Harvesting Seeds from A New Kind of Science</h2>\n<p><em>A New Kind of Science</em> is full of intellectual seeds. And in the past few years—having now returned to basic science—I’ve been harvesting a few of those seeds. The <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> and the Metamathematics Project are two major results. But there’s been quite a bit more. And in fact it’s rather remarkable how many things that were barely more than footnotes in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/new-kind-of-science/'>turned into major projects</a>, with important results.</p>\n<p>Back in 2018—a year before beginning the Physics Project—I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>returned, for example,</a> to what’s become known as the Wolfram Axiom: the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p808--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>axiom that I found in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> that is the very simplest possible axiom for Boolean algebra. But my focus now was not so much on the axiom itself as on the automated process of proving its correctness, and the effort to see the relation between “pure computation” and what one might consider a human-absorbable “narrative proof”.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility appeared many times, notably in my efforts to understand <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>AI ethics</a> and the implications of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>computational contracts</a>. I’ve no doubt that in the years to come, the concept of computational irreducibility will become increasingly important in everyday thinking—a bit like how concepts such as energy and momentum from the mathematical paradigm have become important. And in 2019, for example, computational irreducibility made an <a href='https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/6/optimizing-for-engagement-understanding-the-use-of-persuasive-technology-on-internet-platforms' target=_blank rel=noopener>appearance in government affairs</a>, as a result of me <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/testifying-at-the-senate-about-a-i-selected-content-on-the-internet/'>testifying about its implications for legislation about AI selection</a> of content on the internet.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I explored many specific systems about which one can ask all sorts of questions. And one might think that after 20 years “all the obvious questions” would have been answered. But they have not. And in a sense the fact that they have not is a direct reflection of the ubiquity of computational irreducibility. But it’s a fundamental feature that whenever there’s computational irreducibility, there must also be pockets of computational reducibility: in other words, the very existence of computational irreducibility implies an infinite frontier of potential progress. </p>\n<p>Back in 2007, we’d had great success with our <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/'>Turing Machine Prize</a>, and the Turing machine that I’d suspected was the very simplest possible universal Turing machine was <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2007/10/24/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/'>indeed proved universal</a>—providing another piece of evidence for the Principle of Computational Equivalence. And in a sense there’s a general question that’s raised by <em>A New Kind of Science</em> about where the threshold of universality—or computational equivalence—really is in different kinds of systems.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-left: 8px; margin-top: 2px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/7-inset-rule30prize.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"140\" height=\"116\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But there are simpler-to-define questions as well. And ever since I <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf'>first studied rule 30</a> in 1984 I’d wondered about many questions related to it. And in October 2019 I decided to launch the <a href='https://www.rule30prize.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Rule 30 Prizes</a>, defining <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>three specific easy-to-state questions about rule 30</a>. So far I don’t know of progress on them. And for all I know they’ll be open problems for centuries. From the point of view of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a> we can think of them as distant explorations in rulial space, and the question of when they can be answered is like the question of when we’ll have the technology to get to some distant place in physical space.</p>\n<p>Having launched the Physics Project in April 2020, it was rapidly clear that its ideas could also be applied to metamathematics. And it even seemed as if it might be easier to make relevant “real-world” observations in metamathematics than in physics. And the seed for this was in a note in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> entitled “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--empirical-metamathematics/'>Empirical Metamathematics</a>”. That note contained one picture of the theorem-dependency graph of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, which in the summer of 2020 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>expanded into a 70-page study</a>. And in my recent “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>Physicalization of Metamathematics</a>” there’s a continuation of that—beginning to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#empirical-metamathematics'>map out empirical metamathematical space</a>, as explored in the practice of mathematics, with the idea that multicomputational phenomena that in physics may take technically infeasible particle accelerators or telescopes might actually be within reach.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/8-inset-combinators.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"142\" height=\"139\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In addition to being the year we launched our Physics Project, 2020 was also the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/'>100th anniversary of combinators</a>—the first concrete formalization of universal computation. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I devoted a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p711--universality-in-turing-machines-and-other-systems/'>few pages</a> and some <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-11-12--combinators/'>notes</a> to combinators, but I decided to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>do a deep dive</a> and use both what I’d learned from <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and from the Physics Project to take a new look at them. Among other things the result was another <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#updating-schemes-and-multiway-systems'>application of multicomputation</a>, as well as the realization that even though the S, K combinators from 1920 seemed very minimal, it was possible that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/06/1920-2020-and-a-20000-prize-announcing-the-s-combinator-challenge/'>S alone might also be universal</a>, though with something different than the usual input &#8594; output “workflow” of computation. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science </em>a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-5-6--non-deterministic-systems/'>single footnote mentions multiway Turing machines</a>. And early last year I turned this seed into a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/02/multiway-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>long and detailed study</a> that provides further foundational examples of multicomputation, and explores the question of just what it means to “do a computation” multicomputationally—something which I believe is highly relevant not only for practical distributed computing but also for things like molecular computing.</p>\n<p>In 2021 it was the <a href='https://youtu.be/ultMxODJE7o' target=_blank rel=noopener>centenary of Post tag systems</a>, and again I turned a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-7--tag-systems'>few pages in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> into a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/'>long and detailed study</a>. And what’s important about both this and my study of combinators is that they provide foundational examples (much like cellular automata in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>), which even in the past year or so I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>used multiple times</a> in different projects.</p>\n<p>In mid-2021, yet another <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p339--origins-of-discreteness/'>few-page discussion in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> turned into a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/'>detailed study of “The Problem of Distributed Consensus”</a>. And once again, this turned out to have a multicomputational angle, at first in understanding the multiway character of possible outcomes, but later with the realization that the formation of consensus is deeply related to the process of measurement and the coarse-graining involved in it—and the fundamental way that observers extract “coherent experiences” from systems.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, there’s a short note about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-5-6--multiway-systems-based-on-numbers/'>multiway systems based on numbers</a>. And once again, in fall 2021 I expanded on this to produce an <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems/' target=_blank rel=noopener>extensive study of such systems</a>, as a certain kind of very minimal example of multicomputation, that at least in some cases connects with traditional mathematical ideas.</p>\n<p>From the vantage point of multicomputation and our Physics Project it’s interesting to look back at <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and see some of what it describes with more clarity. In the fall of 2021, for example, I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>reviewed what had become of the original goal of &#8220;understanding complexity&#8221;</a>, and what methodological ideas had emerged from that effort. I identified two primary ones, which I called “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>” and “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#metamodeling-and-the-metatheory-of-models'>metamodeling</a>”. Ruliology, as I’ve mentioned above, is my new name for the pure, basic science of studying the behavior of systems with simple rules: in effect, it’s the science of exploring the computational universe.</p>\n<p>Metamodeling is the key to making connections to systems in nature and elsewhere that one wants to study. Its goal is to find the “minimal models for models”. Often there are existing models for systems. But the question is what the ultimate essence of those models is. Can everything be reduced to a cellular automaton? Or a multiway system? What is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-1--issues-of-modelling'>minimal &#8220;computational essence&#8221; of a system</a>? And as we begin to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>apply the multicomputational paradigm to different fields</a>, a key step will be metamodeling. </p>\n<p>Ruliology and metamodeling are in a sense already core concepts in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, though not under those names. Observer theory is much less explicitly covered. And many concepts—like <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graphs</a>, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-relationship-between-graphs-and-the-multiway-causal-graph/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multiway causal graph</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>—have only emerged now, with the Physics Project and the arrival of the multicomputational paradigm. </p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>Multicomputation</a>, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> and the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>Metamathematics Project</a> are sowing their own seeds. But there are still many more seeds to harvest even from <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And just as the multicomputational paradigm was not something that I, for one, could foresee from <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, no doubt there will in time be other major new directions that will emerge. But, needless to say, one should expect that it will be computationally irreducible to determine what will happen: a metacontribution of the science to the consideration of its own future. </p>\n<h2 id='the-doing-of-science'>The Doing of Science</h2>\n<p>The creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>took me a decade of intense work</a>, none of which saw the light of day until the moment the book was published on May 14, 2002. Returning to basic science 17 years later the world had changed and it was possible for me to adopt a quite different approach, in a sense making the process of doing science as open and incremental as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/9-inset-wolfram-language.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" height=\"126\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s helped that there’s the web, <a href='https://wolframcloud.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>the cloud</a> and <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/livestreams'>livestreaming</a>. But in a sense the most crucial element has been the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>, and its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>character as a full-scale computational language</a>. Yes, I use English to tell the story of what we’re doing. But fundamentally I’m doing science in the Wolfram Language, using it both as a practical tool, and as a medium for organizing my thoughts, and sharing and communicating what I’m doing.</p>\n<p>Starting in 2003, we’ve had an annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Wolfram Summer School</a> at which a long string of talented students have explored ideas based on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, always through the medium of the Wolfram Language. In the last couple of years we’ve added a <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school/programs/physics/'>Physics track</a>, connected to the Physics Project, and this year we’re adding a Metamathematics track, connected to the Metamathematics Project.</p>\n<p>During the 17 years that I wasn’t focused on basic science, I was doing technology development. And I think it’s fair to say that at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a> over the past 35 years we’ve created a remarkably effective “machine” for doing innovative research and development. Mostly it’s been producing <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/technologies'>technology</a> and <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/products'>products</a>. But one of the very interesting features of the Physics Project and the projects that have followed it is that we’ve been applying the same managed approach to innovation to them that we have been using so successfully for so many years at our company. And I consider the results to be quite spectacular: in a matter of weeks or months I think we’ve managed to deliver what might otherwise have taken years, if it could have been done at all. </p>\n<p>And particularly with the arrival of the multicomputational paradigm there’s quite a challenge. There are a huge number of exceptionally promising directions to follow, that have the potential to deliver revolutionary results. And with our concepts of managed research, open science and broad connection to talent it should be possible to make great progress even fairly quickly. But to do so requires significant scaling up of our efforts so far, which is why we’re now <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/04/weve-got-a-science-opportunity-overload-its-time-to-launch-the-wolfram-institute/'>launching the Wolfram Institute</a> to serve as a focal point for these efforts.</p>\n<p>When I think about <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I can’t help but be struck by all the things that had to align to make it possible. My early experiences in science and technology, the personal environment I’d created—and the tools I built. I wondered at the time whether the five years I took “away from basic science” to <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>launch Mathematica</a> and what’s now the Wolfram Language might have slowed down what became <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. Looking back I can say that the answer was definitively no. Because without the Wolfram Language the creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would have needed “not just a decade”, but likely more than a lifetime. </p>\n<p>And a similar pattern has repeated now, though even more so. The Physics Project and everything that has developed from it has been made possible by a tower of specific circumstances that stretch back nearly half a century—including my 17-year hiatus from basic science. Had all these circumstances not aligned, it is hard to say when something like the Physics Project would have happened, but my guess is that it would have been at least a significant part of a century away. </p>\n<p>It is a lesson of the history of science that the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/05/living-a-paradigm-shift-looking-back-on-reactions-to-a-new-kind-of-science/'>absorption of major new paradigms</a> is a slow process. And normally the timescales are long compared to the 20 years since <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was published. But in a sense we’ve managed to jump far ahead of schedule with the Physics Project and with the development of the multicomputational paradigm. Five years ago, when I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/'>summarized the first 15 years of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> I had no idea that any of this would happen. </p>\n<p>But now that it has—and with all the methodology we’ve developed for getting science done—it feels as if we have a certain obligation to see just what can be achieved. And to see just what can be built in the years to come on the foundations laid down by <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. </p>\n",

For 45 years I’ve devoted myself to building a taller and taller tower of science and technology—which along the way has delivered <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/'>many outputs</a> of which I’m quite proud. But starting in 2020 with the unexpected breakthroughs of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a> we’ve jumped to a whole new level. And suddenly—yes, building on our multi-decade tower—it seems as if we’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>found a new paradigm</a> that’s incredibly powerful, and that’s going to let us tackle an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>almost absurd range of longstanding questions</a> in all sorts of areas of science.</p>\n<p>Developing a fundamental theory of physics is certainly an ambitious place to start, and I’m happy to say that things seem to be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/the-wolfram-physics-project-a-one-year-update/'>going quite excellently there</a>, not least in providing new foundations for many existing results and initiatives in physics. But the amazing (and to me very unexpected) thing is that we can take our new paradigm and also apply it to a huge range of other areas. Just a couple of weeks ago I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>published a 250-page treatise</a> about its application to the “physicalization of metamathematics”—and to providing a very new view of the foundations of mathematics (with implications both for the question of what mathematics really is, and for the practical long-term future of mathematics).<span id=\"more-36394\"></span></p>\n<p>In a sense, everything we’re doing ultimately builds on the great intellectual tide of the past century: the rise of the concept of computation. (And, yes, that’s something in which I’ve been deeply involved both scientifically and technologically throughout my career.) But what’s happening now is something else—that one can see as the birth of what I call the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>. It’s all about doing what our Physics Project has suggested, and going beyond working with specific computations—to look at the systemic behavior of whole interacting collections of computations. In the whole multi-millennium history of science, there’ve only been a very few fundamentally different paradigms for making models of things—and I think multicomputation is basically the fourth one ever. </p>\n<p>And what makes its arrival particularly dramatic is that it comes already supercharged by its deep relation to physics, and by its ability to spread the successes of physics to other areas of science, and beyond. When I started investigating the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> in the 1980s it became clear that there are fundamental barriers to many kinds of scientific progress. But what I didn’t see coming is there would be a new path opened up by a new paradigm: the paradigm of multicomputation. And suddenly there are now all sorts of fundamental questions that are no longer blocked—and instead are ripe for rapid progress.</p>\n<p>Over the past year we’ve started exploring a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>host of potential application areas</a>. We’ve got a concept of “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>formalized subchemistry</a>” with applications to a new way of thinking about molecular computing, and with potentially dramatic implications for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular biology</a>. We’ve got new ideas about how to think about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#immunology'>immunology</a> and probably also <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#neuroscience'>neuroscience</a>. We’ve got a potential new approach to finding a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#evolutionary-biology'>formalization for biological evolution</a> and its relation to biocomplexity. We’ve got a new concept for “geometrizing” the space of programs—with implications for <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>foundational questions in computational complexity theory</a>. We’ve got a promising way to construct new kinds of theories for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economics</a>, with implications, for example, for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/'>distributed generalizations of blockchain</a>. We’ve got a potential new way to think about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics'>linguistics</a>, and the structure of meaning space. Oh, and we’ve got a new “physicalized” way to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#distributed-computing'>conceptualize and organize distributed computing</a>. </p>\n<p>In the nearly half a century that I’ve been doing science, I’ve had the good fortune to be involved in quite a few significant bursts of progress. But I’ve never seen one quite as concentrated and immediate as what we’re now seeing. It’s an exciting thing. But it’s also overwhelming. There’s just so much low-hanging fruit to be picked—so many things with such important potential consequences, for science, technology and the world. </p>\n<p>We’ve been working very hard to move all this forward with the resources we have available. But even though I think we’ve achieved a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/all-by-date/'>remarkable level of productivity</a>, it’s become clear that there’s just too much to do. We’re in the midst of a major “science opportunity overload”. And to be good stewards of the ideas and their potential we’ve got to scale things up. I’ve had lots of experience over decades in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/company'>making big projects happen</a>. And now it’s time to take that experience and define a new structure to move forward the amazing science opportunity we find ourselves with. </p>\n<p>And I think that leaves us no choice: we’ve got to launch the Wolfram Institute, and now!</p>\n<h2 id='maximizing-scientific-productivity-&#038;-communication'>Maximizing Scientific Productivity &#038; Communication</h2>\n<p>In the course of my life I’ve spent a great deal of effort trying to maximize productivity and innovation around the things I do. I’ve done lots of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/'>(arguably nerdy) optimization of my own personal setup</a>. I’ve thought long and hard about the best strategies both for choosing what to do, and for getting things done. But in many ways the most important piece has been the whole structure we’ve built up over the past 35 years at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>.</p>\n<p>I sometimes refer to our company as a machine for turning ideas into real things. And I think it’s been an extremely impressive machine—year after year for more than three decades <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/12/launching-version-13-0-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/'>systematically delivering all sorts of far-reaching innovation</a>, and using our progressive tower of technology to efficiently implement it on larger and larger scales.</p>\n<p>As a company, we’ve mainly been concerned with delivering technology and products. But the systems, culture and methodologies we’ve developed are, at their core, about maximizing innovation and productivity. So what happens if we apply them to science? </p>\n<p><em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> was in a sense a first result, and I consider it an impressive one. Indeed, even nearly 20 years after it was published I’m still amazed at the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-for-chapters/'>sheer volume</a>—and depth—of scientific results that it was possible to obtain in the span of just a single decade.</p>\n<p>But with the Wolfram Physics Project it’s a yet more impressive story. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>We started late in 2019</a>, and in less than six months—with an extremely small team—we were able to make dramatic progress, and to publish nearly 700 pages of material about it. It wouldn’t have been even vaguely possible without the whole tower of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/tools/' target=_blank rel=noopener>computational tooling provided by the Wolfram Language</a>. And nor would it have been possible without the structure and strategy for doing projects that we’ve honed over the past three decades. </p>\n<p>In the past two years, we’ve been energetically moving forward—and we’ve now published altogether <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/' target=_blank rel=noopener>over 2500 pages of new material</a>, as well as nearly <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Tools/guide-page'>200 publicly deployed new functions</a>. In terms of scientific ideas the pace of innovation has been quite breathtaking. But we’ve also been innovating in terms of how to do the science.</p>\n<p>An important objective has been to open the science up to give the widest possible access and potential for engagement. I’ve worked hard to define a style of expository writing that makes what we’ve done accessible to a wide audience as well as to experts. And in what we&#8217;ve published, essentially every graphic has <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>&#8220;click-to-copy&#8221; Wolfram Language code</a>, that anyone can immediately run and build on. We&#8217;ve also <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/archives/index/' target=_blank rel=noopener>uploaded our working notebooks</a>—so far nearly 2000 of them—so that everyone can see not only our “finished product” but also the research (wrong turns and all) that led to it.</p>\n<p>A few years ago I started <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>livestreaming to the world</a> many of our software design reviews. And building on this concept, we’ve now routinely been <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/physics-project-working-sessions' target=_blank rel=noopener>livestreaming our scientific working sessions</a>—giving people for the first time real-time visibility into how science is done, as well as the possibility to interact with it. And for those interested in an even deeper dive, we’ve also been recording and uploading “<a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/personal-video-worklogs' target=_blank rel=noopener>video work logs</a>”—bringing us up to a total of nearly 1000 hours of video so far.</p>\n<p>Even when we thought we were “just solving physics” we knew we had to involve other people in the project. For 20 years we’ve been doing a very successful annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Summer School</a> about our approach to science and technology, and starting in 2020 we added a <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school/programs/physics/'>track about the Physics Project</a>, as well as a physics Winter School. We’ve had a terrific stream of “students” for our Physics Project. And partly building on this we’ve been setting up a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/people/' target=_blank rel=noopener>network of people involved in the Physics Project</a>—now with 55 members from 20 countries. </p>\n<p>Increasingly, there’s work based on our Physics Project that’s happening in academic institutions, quite independent of us. And no doubt this will bear all sorts of fruit. </p>\n<p>But as we look at the next phases of our Physics Project, and even more so the huge collection of opportunities provided by our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>new multicomputational paradigm</a>, it’s clear there’s so much to do that—particularly if we want it to happen in years rather than decades—we need a more focused approach.</p>\n<p>And the good news is that through 35 years of experience at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>, as well as the experience of <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> and the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>, we have an excellent blueprint for what to do. But now we have to implement it at scale. And that’s what the Wolfram Institute is about. </p>\n<h2 id='the-plan-for-the-wolfram-institute'>The Plan for the Wolfram Institute</h2>\n<p>The basic plan is simple: to create a basic-science analog of the immensely productive “machine” that I’ve built at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a> over the past 35 years—and to use this “machine” to accelerate the delivery of new science by many decades if not more. We’ve already got a definite seed: the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>. But now we have to scale this up to the full Wolfram Institute—and give it the structure it needs to grow and take full advantage of the amazing opportunities we now have.</p>\n<p>It’s often assumed that the way to achieve maximum innovation is to put together innovative people, and then let them “just innovate” in whatever directions they choose. But it has been my consistent experience that the greatest innovation is instead achieved when there is a definite “flow” and definite, ambitious goals. The Wolfram Institute is going to be about doing large-scale basic research this way. </p>\n<p>Modeled on Wolfram Research and the Wolfram Physics Project, the idea of the Wolfram Institute is to aggressively pursue basic research that’s explicitly managed and energetically led towards its goals. </p>\n<p>Our initial goals are already tremendously ambitious. We want to use our new paradigm to basically rewrite the foundations of several important fields of science. As with the Physics Project there’ll no doubt be tremendous synergy with existing approaches and the communities around them. But with the paradigm we now have, the tools and methods we’ve developed, and the organizational framework we’re defining for the Wolfram Institute, I think we have the opportunity to jump ahead, and in effect to deliver foundational science that would otherwise emerge at best only in the distant future. </p>\n<p>It’s going to be an exciting thing to be a part of, and—as with projects I’ve done in the past—there are going to be many outstanding people who want to be involved. Our many decades of activity in science and technology have provided an extremely broad network of contacts, and we’ve developed a particularly concentrated pipeline of worldwide talent through our annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Summer School</a> (as well as our <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-camp/'>High School Summer Camp</a>).</p>\n<p>What will the Wolfram Institute be like? There’ll be a leadership core, which, yes, I’m signing up to head. But the main meat of the institute will be a collection of researchers and fellows, working on particular, managed projects—together with students at multiple levels from high school to graduate school. We’ll be doing open science, so there’ll be lots of livestreaming and lots of open tools produced. There’ll be lots of working materials and academic papers published, and whenever we manage to make a big step forward our plan is to present it to the world using the immediate and accessible approach to exposition that I’ve developed.</p>\n<p>In what we’ve done for the past 35 years at Wolfram Research there’s in a sense a clear model for how the organization fundamentally operates. We invent things, then we deliver them in products—and from these products we derive revenue, which is then used to allow us to invent more things and deliver more products. It’s been an extremely productive setup. And because we’re a private company without outside investment we’re able to chart our own course, pursuing the ambitious and long-term projects that we believe in. Often we choose to make things we do freely available to the world, but in the end we rely on the fact that we’re producing commercially valuable products from which we derive revenue that funds our activities. </p>\n<p>There’s no question that the science we’ll be doing at the Wolfram Institute will lead to things of great value to the world. But it won’t be near-term commercial value. And our fundamental model is to concentrate on producing the best and broadest long-term basic research—rather than to aim for things that can be deployed directly in specific products that provide immediate value to specific customers.</p>\n<p>In a sense, our “customer” is the world at large—and the future. But in the present we need a way to support our researchers and fellows. So far we’ve basically been incubating the Wolfram Institute within our existing organization, with me effectively footing the bill. But as we launch the full Wolfram Institute we need a larger scale of support, and we’re counting on having a network of people and organizations to provide that.</p>\n<p>Some of the support will be for specific researchers, fellows or students, perhaps drawn from particular geographies, backgrounds or communities. Some of it will be for specific projects. But it’s also important to have a stable core of support that will allow the institute to pursue long-term basic research that will likely deliver many of its most valuable results through developments that are in effect computationally irreducible to predict in advance.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to know how society at large should value the general activity of basic research, and it’s easy to criticize the inefficiencies of a large-scale “just let researchers do what they want” approach. But with the Wolfram Institute we have a very different model. We’re starting the institute right now for a specific reason: we’ve got a new paradigm that’s just opened up an amazing collection of possibilities. And we plan to pursue those possibilities in an efficient and tightly managed way, optimized for innovation and new ideas.</p>\n<p>When I look at our Physics Project and what we’ve achieved so far with it, I’m frankly amazed at how quickly and comparatively frugally we’ve managed to do it. (Yes, it helps that at least so far we need only people and computers, not telescopes and particle accelerators.) And as we scale this up to all the various projects we plan at the Wolfram Institute, it’s almost absurd how much of long-term significance I expect we will be able to deliver for how comparatively little.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Physics Project has been done as an entirely geodistributed project—building on the 30+ years of experience with coherent geodistributed work that we’ve had at Wolfram Research. And even though its projects will be tightly managed, the Wolfram Institute will also primarily be geodistributed, although we plan regular physical events and we’ll probably have some physical locations available. </p>\n<p>It’s been great in working on the Wolfram Physics Project to have what we’ve been doing be so open, and to be able to share it with so many people. And as we launch the Wolfram Institute I’m looking forward to having all sorts of people involved, both within the institute, and as supporters of it.</p>\n<p>It’s been exciting these past many months seeing the whole multicomputational paradigm emerge, and seeing more and more possibilities reveal themselves. It’s a remarkable—if overwhelming—collection of opportunities, and I believe a historic moment for the progress of science. And as we launch the Wolfram Institute I hope that with the help of enough supporters we’ll be able to deliver many dramatic results that will have great long-term value to the world and to the arc of intellectual history. </p>\n<div class=\"purplestripe\">\n<strong>Learn more about our plans: <a href=\"mailto:institute@wolframfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\">contact the Wolfram Institute team &#187;</a></strong>\n</div>\n",

We might have imagined that physics would have certain laws, and mathematics would have certain theories, and that while they might be historically related, there wouldn’t be any fundamental formal correspondence between them. </p>\r\n<p>But what our Physics Project suggests is that underneath everything we physically experience there is a single very general abstract structure—that we call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>—and that our physical laws arise in an inexorable way from the particular samples we take of this structure. We can think of the ruliad as the entangled limit of all possible computations—or in effect a representation of all possible formal processes. And this then leads us to the idea that perhaps the ruliad might underlie not only physics but also mathematics—and that everything in mathematics, like everything in physics, might just be the result of sampling the ruliad. <!--more-->",

We might have imagined that physics would have certain laws, and mathematics would have certain theories, and that while they might be historically related, there wouldn’t be any fundamental formal correspondence between them. </p>\n<p>But what our Physics Project suggests is that underneath everything we physically experience there is a single very general abstract structure—that we call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>—and that our physical laws arise in an inexorable way from the particular samples we take of this structure. We can think of the ruliad as the entangled limit of all possible computations—or in effect a representation of all possible formal processes. And this then leads us to the idea that perhaps the ruliad might underlie not only physics but also mathematics—and that everything in mathematics, like everything in physics, might just be the result of sampling the ruliad. <span id=\"more-34645\"></span></p>\n<p><a name='mathematical-observer'></a>Of course, mathematics as it’s normally practiced doesn’t look the same as physics. But the idea is that they can both be seen as views of the same underlying structure. What makes them different is that physical and mathematical observers sample this structure in somewhat different ways. But since in the end both kinds of observers are associated with human experience they inevitably have certain core characteristics in common. And the result is that there should be “fundamental laws of mathematics” that in some sense mirror the perceived laws of physics that we derive from our physical observation of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>So what might those fundamental laws of mathematics be like? And how might they inform our conception of the foundations of mathematics, and our view of what mathematics really is?</p>\n<p>The most obvious manifestation of the mathematics that we humans have developed over the course of many centuries is the few million mathematical theorems that have been published in the literature of mathematics. But what can be said in generality about this thing we call mathematics? Is there some notion of what mathematics is like “in bulk”? And what might we be able to say, for example, about the structure of mathematics in the limit of infinite future development?</p>\n<p>When we do physics, the traditional approach has been to start from our basic sensory experience of the physical world, and of concepts like space, time and motion—and then to try to formalize our descriptions of these things, and build on these formalizations. And in its early development—for example by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>Euclid</a>—mathematics took the same basic approach. But beginning a little more than a century ago there emerged the idea that one could build mathematics purely from formal axioms, without necessarily any reference to what is accessible to sensory experience.</p>\n<p>And in a way our Physics Project begins from a similar place. Because at the outset it just considers purely abstract structures and abstract rules—typically described in terms of hypergraph rewriting—and then tries to deduce their consequences. Many of these consequences are incredibly complicated, and full of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>. But the remarkable discovery is that when sampled by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers with certain general characteristics that make them like us</a>, the behavior that emerges must generically have regularities that we can recognize, and in fact must follow exactly known core laws of physics.</p>\n<p>And already this begins to suggest a new perspective to apply to the foundations of mathematics. But there’s another piece, and that’s the idea of the ruliad. We might have supposed that our universe is based on some particular chosen underlying rule, like an axiom system we might choose in mathematics. But the concept of the ruliad is in effect to represent the entangled result of “running all possible rules”. And the key point is then that it turns out that an “observer like us” sampling the ruliad must perceive behavior that corresponds to known laws of physics. In other words, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>without “making any choice” it&#8217;s inevitable</a>—given what we’re like as observers—that our “experience of the ruliad” will show fundamental laws of physics.</p>\n<p>But now we can make a bridge to mathematics. Because in embodying all possible computational processes the ruliad also necessarily embodies the consequences of all possible axiom systems. As humans doing physics we’re effectively taking a certain sampling of the ruliad. And we realize that as humans doing mathematics we’re also doing essentially the same kind of thing. </p>\n<p>But will we see “general laws of mathematics” in the same kind of way that we see “general laws of physics”? It depends on what we’re like as “mathematical observers”. In physics, there turn out to be general laws—and concepts like space and motion—that we humans can assimilate. And in the abstract it might not be that anything similar would be true in mathematics. But it seems as if the thing mathematicians typically call mathematics is something for which it is—and where (usually in the end leveraging our experience of physics) it’s possible to successfully carve out a sampling of the ruliad that’s again one we humans can assimilate. </p>\n<p>When we think about physics we have the idea that there’s an actual physical reality that exists—and that we experience physics within this. But in the formal axiomatic view of mathematics, things are different. There’s no obvious “underlying reality” there; instead there’s just a certain choice we make of axiom system. But now, with the concept of the ruliad, the story is different. Because now we have the idea that “deep underneath” both physics and mathematics there’s the same thing: the ruliad. And that means that insofar as physics is “grounded in reality”, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>so also must mathematics be</a>.</p>\n<p>When most working mathematicians do mathematics it seems to be typical for them to reason as if the constructs they’re dealing with (whether they be numbers or sets or whatever) are “real things”. But usually there’s a concept that in principle one could “drill down” and formalize everything in terms of some axiom system. And indeed if one wants to get a global view of mathematics and its structure as it is today, it seems as if the best approach is to work from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p773--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>formalization that’s been done with axiom systems</a>.</p>\n<p>In starting from the ruliad and the ideas of our Physics Project we’re in effect positing a certain “theory of mathematics”. And to validate this theory we need to study the “phenomena of mathematics”. And, yes, we could do this in effect by directly “reading the whole literature of mathematics”. But it’s more efficient to start from what’s in a sense the “current prevailing underlying theory of mathematics” and to begin by building on the methods of formalized mathematics and axiom systems.</p>\n<p>Over the past century a certain amount of metamathematics has been done by looking at the general properties of these methods. But most often when the methods are systematically used today, it’s to set up some particular mathematical derivation, normally with the aid of a computer. But here what we want to do is think about what happens if the methods are used “in bulk”. Underneath there may be all sorts of specific detailed formal derivations being done. But somehow what emerges from this is something higher level, something “more human”—and ultimately something that corresponds to our experience of pure mathematics.</p>\n<p>How might this work? We can get an idea from an analogy in physics. Imagine we have a gas. Underneath, it consists of zillions of molecules bouncing around in detailed and complicated patterns. But most of our “human” experience of the gas is at a much more coarse-grained level—where we perceive not the detailed motions of individual molecules, but instead continuum fluid mechanics.</p>\n<p>And so it is, I think, with mathematics. All those detailed formal derivations—for example of the kind <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>automated theorem proving</a> might do—are like molecular dynamics. But most of our “human experience of mathematics”—where we talk about concepts like integers or morphisms—is like fluid dynamics. The molecular dynamics is what builds up the fluid, but for most questions of “human interest” it’s possible to “reason at the fluid dynamics level”, without dropping down to molecular dynamics.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly not obvious that this would be possible. It could be that one might start off describing things at a “fluid dynamics” level—say in the case of an actual fluid talking about the motion of vortices—but that everything would quickly get “shredded”, and that there’d soon be nothing like a vortex to be seen, only elaborate patterns of detailed microscopic molecular motions. And similarly in mathematics one might imagine that one would be able to prove theorems in terms of things like real numbers but actually find that everything gets “shredded” to the point where one has to start talking about elaborate issues of mathematical logic and different possible axiomatic foundations.</p>\n<p>But in physics we effectively have the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>—which we now <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>understand in terms of computational irreducibility</a>—that tells us that there’s a robust sense in which the microscopic details are systematically “washed out” so that things like fluid dynamics “work”. Just sometimes—like in studying Brownian motion, or hypersonic flow—the molecular dynamics level still “shines through”. But for most “human purposes” we can describe fluids just using ordinary fluid dynamics.</p>\n<p>So what’s the analog of this in mathematics? Presumably it’s that there’s some kind of “general law of mathematics” that explains why one can so often do mathematics “purely in the large”. Just like in fluid mechanics there can be “corner-case” questions that probe down to the “molecular scale”—and indeed that’s where we can expect to see things like undecidability, as a rough analog of situations where we end up tracing the potentially infinite paths of single molecules rather than just looking at “overall fluid effects”. But somehow in most cases there’s some much stronger phenomenon at work—that effectively aggregates low-level details to allow the kind of “bulk description” that ends up being the essence of what we normally in practice call mathematics.</p>\n<p>But is such a phenomenon something formally inevitable, or does it somehow depend on us humans “being in the loop”? In the case of the Second Law it’s crucial that we only get to track coarse-grained features of a gas—as we humans with our current technology typically do. Because if instead we watched and decoded what every individual molecule does, we wouldn’t end up identifying anything like the usual bulk “Second-Law” behavior. In other words, the emergence of the Second Law is in effect a direct consequence of the fact that it’s us humans—with our limitations on measurement and computation—who are observing the gas.</p>\n<p>So is something similar happening with mathematics? At the underlying “molecular level” there’s a lot going on. But the way we humans think about things, we’re effectively taking just particular kinds of samples. And those samples turn out to give us “general laws of mathematics” that give us our usual experience of “human-level mathematics”.</p>\n<p><a name='axiomatic-level'></a>To ultimately ground this we have to go down to the fully abstract level of the ruliad, but we’ll already see many core effects by looking at mathematics essentially just at a traditional “axiomatic level”, albeit “in bulk”. </p>\n<p>The full story—and the full correspondence between physics and mathematics—requires in a sense “going below” the level at which we have recognizable formal axiomatic mathematical structures; it requires going to a level at which we’re just talking about making everything out of completely abstract elements, which in physics we might interpret as “atoms of space” and in mathematics as some kind of “symbolic raw material” below variables and operators and everything else familiar in traditional axiomatic mathematics.</p>\n<p>The deep correspondence we’re describing between physics and mathematics might make one wonder to what extent the methods we use in physics can be applied to mathematics, and vice versa. In axiomatic mathematics the emphasis tends to be on looking at particular theorems and seeing how they can be knitted together with proofs. And one could certainly imagine an analogous “axiomatic physics” in which one does particular experiments, then sees how they can “deductively” be knitted together. But our impression that there’s an “actual reality” to physics makes us seek broader laws. And the correspondence between physics and mathematics implied by the ruliad now suggests that we should be doing this in mathematics as well.</p>\n<p>What will we find? Some of it in essence just confirms impressions that working pure mathematicians already have. But it provides a definite framework for understanding these impressions and for seeing what their limits may be. It also lets us address questions like why undecidability is so comparatively rare in practical pure mathematics, and why it is so common to discover remarkable correspondences between apparently quite different areas of mathematics. And beyond that, it suggests a host of new questions and approaches both to mathematics and metamathematics—that help frame the foundations of the remarkable intellectual edifice that we call mathematics. </p>\n<h2 id='the-underlying-structure-of-mathematics-and-physics'><span>2 | </span>The Underlying Structure of Mathematics and Physics</h2>\n<p>If we “drill down” to what we’ve called above the “molecular level” of mathematics, what will we find there? There are many technical details (some of which we’ll discuss later) about the historical conventions of mathematics and its presentation. But in broad outline we can think of there as being a kind of “gas” of “mathematical statements”—like 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 or <em>x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>x</em>—represented in some specified symbolic language. (And, yes, <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> provides a well-developed example of what that language can be like.)</p>\n<p>But how does the “gas of statements” behave? The essential point is that new statements are derived from existing ones by “interactions” that implement laws of inference (like that <em>q</em> can be derived from the statement <em>p</em> and the statement “<em>p</em> implies <em>q</em>”). And if we trace the paths by which one statement can be derived from others, these correspond to proofs. And the whole graph of all these derivations is then a representation of the possible historical development of mathematics—with slices through this graph corresponding to the sets of statements reached at a given stage.</p>\n<p>By talking about things like a “gas of statements” we’re making this sound a bit like physics. But while in physics a gas consists of actual, physical molecules, in mathematics our statements are just abstract things. But this is where the discoveries of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> start to be important. Because in our project we’re “drilling down” beneath for example the usual notions of space and time to an “ultimate machine code” for the physical universe. And we can think of that ultimate machine code as operating on things that are in effect just abstract constructs—very much like in mathematics.</p>\n<p>In particular, we imagine that space and everything in it is made up of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>giant network (hypergraph) of “atoms of space”</a>—with each “atom of space” just being an abstract element that has certain relations with other elements. The evolution of the universe in time then corresponds to the application of computational rules that (much like laws of inference) take abstract relations and yield new relations—thereby progressively updating the network that represents space and everything in it.</p>\n<p>But while the individual rules may be very simple, the whole detailed pattern of behavior to which they lead is normally very complicated—and typically shows <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>, so that there’s no way to systematically find its outcome except in effect by explicitly tracing each step. But despite all this underlying complexity it turns out—much like in the case of an ordinary gas—that at a coarse-grained level there are much simpler (“bulk”) laws of behavior that one can identify. And the remarkable thing is that these turn out to be exactly general relativity and quantum mechanics (which, yes, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>end up being the same theory</a> when looked at in terms of an appropriate generalization of the notion of space). </p>\n<p>But down at the lowest level, is there some specific computational rule that’s “running the universe”? I don’t think so. Instead, I think that in effect all possible rules are always being applied. And the result is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>: the entangled structure associated with performing all possible computations. </p>\n<p>But what then gives us our experience of the universe and of physics? Inevitably we are observers embedded within the ruliad, sampling only certain features of it. But what features we sample are determined by the characteristics of us as observers. And what seem to be critical to have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>“observers like us” are basically two characteristics</a>. First, that we are computationally bounded. And second, that we somehow persistently maintain our coherence—in the sense that we can consistently identify what constitutes “us” even though the detailed atoms of space involved are continually changing.</p>\n<p><a name='rulial-space'></a>But we can think of different “observers like us” as taking different specific samples, corresponding to different reference frames in rulial space, or just different positions in rulial space. These different observers may describe the universe as evolving according to different specific underlying rules. But the crucial point is that the general structure of the ruliad implies that so long as the observers are “like us”, it’s inevitable that their perception of the universe will be that it follows things like general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>It’s very much like what happens with a gas of molecules: to an “observer like us” there are the same gas laws and the same laws of fluid dynamics essentially independent of the detailed structure of the individual molecules. </p>\n<p>So what does all this mean for mathematics? The crucial and at first surprising point is that the ideas we’re describing in physics can in effect immediately be carried over to mathematics. And the key is that the ruliad represents not only all physics, but also all mathematics—and it shows that these are not just related, but in some sense fundamentally the same.</p>\n<p>In the traditional formulation of axiomatic mathematics, one talks about deriving results from particular axiom systems—say <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--axioms-for-arithmetic/'>Peano Arithmetic</a>, or <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC set theory</a>, or the axioms of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>Euclidean geometry</a>. But the ruliad in effect represents the entangled consequences not just of specific axiom systems but of all possible axiom systems (as well as all possible laws of inference). </p>\n<p>But from this structure that in a sense corresponds to all possible mathematics, how do we pick out any particular mathematics that we’re interested in? The answer is that just as we are limited observers of the physical universe, so we are also limited observers of the “mathematical universe”. </p>\n<p>But what are we like as “mathematical observers”? As I’ll argue in more detail later, we inherit our core characteristics from those we exhibit as “physical observers”. And that means that when we “do mathematics” we’re effectively sampling the ruliad in much the same way as when we “do physics”. </p>\n<p>We can operate in different rulial reference frames, or at different locations in rulial space, and these will correspond to picking out different underlying “rules of mathematics”, or essentially using different axiom systems. But now we can make use of the correspondence with physics to say that we can also expect there to be certain “overall laws of mathematics” that are the result of general features of the ruliad as perceived by observers like us.</p>\n<p>And indeed we can expect that in some formal sense these overall laws will have exactly the same structure as those in physics—so that in effect in mathematics we’ll have something like the notion of space that we have in physics, as well as formal analogs of things like general relativity and quantum mechanics. </p>\n<p>What does this mean? It implies that—just as it’s possible to have coherent “higher-level descriptions” in physics that don’t just operate down at the level of atoms of space, so also this should be possible in mathematics. And this in a sense is why we can expect to consistently do what I described above as “human-level mathematics”, without usually having to drop down to the “molecular level” of specific axiomatic structures (or below).</p>\n<p>Say we’re talking about the Pythagorean theorem. Given some particular detailed axiom system for mathematics we can imagine using it to build up a precise—if potentially very long and pedantic—representation of the theorem. But let’s say we change some detail of our axioms, say associated with the way they talk about sets, or real numbers. We’ll almost certainly still be able to build up something we consider to be “the Pythagorean theorem”—even though the details of the representation will be different.</p>\n<p>In other words, this thing that we as humans would call “the Pythagorean theorem” is not just a single point in the ruliad, but a whole cloud of points. And now the question is: what happens if we try to derive other results from the Pythagorean theorem? It might be that each particular representation of the theorem—corresponding to each point in the cloud—would lead to quite different results. But it could also be that essentially the whole cloud would coherently lead to the same results.</p>\n<p>And the claim from the correspondence with physics is that there should be “general laws of mathematics” that apply to “observers like us” and that ensure that there’ll be coherence between all the different specific representations associated with the cloud that we identify as “the Pythagorean theorem”.</p>\n<p>In physics it could have been that we’d always have to separately say what happens to every atom of space. But we know that there’s a coherent higher-level description of space—in which for example we can just imagine that objects can move while somehow maintaining their identity. And we can now expect that it’s the same kind of thing in mathematics: that just as there’s a coherent notion of space in physics where things can for example move without being “shredded”, so also this will happen in mathematics. And this is why it’s possible to do “higher-level mathematics” without always dropping down to the lowest level of axiomatic derivations.</p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that even in physical space a concept like “pure motion” in which objects can move while maintaining their identity doesn’t always work. For example, close to a spacetime singularity, one can expect to eventually be forced to see through to the discrete structure of space—and for any “object” to inevitably be “shredded”. But most of the time it’s possible for observers like us to maintain the idea that there are coherent large-scale features whose behavior we can study using “bulk” laws of physics.</p>\n<p>And we can expect the same kind of thing to happen with mathematics. Later on, we’ll discuss more specific correspondences between phenomena in physics and mathematics—and we’ll see the effects of things like general relativity and quantum mechanics in mathematics, or, more precisely, in metamathematics. </p>\n<p>But for now, the key point is that we can think of mathematics as somehow being made of exactly the same stuff as physics: they’re both just features of the ruliad, as sampled by observers like us. And in what follows we’ll see the great power that arises from using this to combine the achievements and intuitions of physics and mathematics—and how this lets us think about new “general laws of mathematics”, and view the ultimate foundations of mathematics in a different light.</p>\n<h2 id='the-metamodeling-of-axiomatic-mathematics'><span>3 | </span>The Metamodeling of Axiomatic Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Consider all the mathematical statements that have appeared in mathematical books and papers. We can view these in some sense as the “observed phenomena” of (human) mathematics. And if we’re going to make a “general theory of mathematics” a first step is to do something like we’d typically do in natural science, and try to “drill down” to find a uniform underlying model—or at least representation—for all of them.</p>\n<p>At the outset, it might not be clear what sort of representation could possibly capture all those different mathematical statements. But what’s emerged over the past century or so—with particular clarity in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> and the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>—is that there is in fact a rather simple and general representation that works remarkably well: a representation in which everything is a symbolic expression. </p>\n<p>One can view a symbolic expression such as <tt>f[g[x][y, h[z]], w]</tt> as a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/33-expressions-and-their-structure.html'>hierarchical or tree structure</a>, in which at every level some particular “head” (like <tt>f</tt>) is “applied to” one or more arguments. Often in practice one deals with expressions in which the heads have “known meanings”—as in <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Times.html'>Times</a>[<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a>[2, 3], 4]</tt> in Wolfram Language. And with this kind of setup symbolic expressions are reminiscent of human natural language, with the heads basically corresponding to “known words” in the language. </p>\n<p>And presumably it’s this familiarity from human natural language that’s caused “human natural mathematics” to develop in a way that can so readily be represented by symbolic expressions. </p>\n<p>But in typical mathematics there’s an important wrinkle. One often wants to make statements not just about particular things but about whole classes of things. And it’s common to then just declare that some of the “symbols” (like, say, <em>x</em>) that appear in an expression are “variables”, while others (like, say, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a></tt>) are not. But in our effort to capture the essence of mathematics as uniformly as possible it seems much better to burn the idea of an object representing a whole class of things right into the structure of the symbolic expression. </p>\n<p><a name='pattern-expression'></a>And indeed this is a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/32-patterns.html'>core idea in the Wolfram Language</a>, where something like <em>x</em> or <tt>f</tt> is just a “symbol that stands for itself”, while <em>x_</em> is a pattern (named <em>x</em>) that can stand for anything. (More precisely, <em>_</em> on its own is what stands for “anything”, and <em>x_</em>—which can also be written <em>x:_</em>—just says that whatever <em>_</em> stands for in a particular instance will be called <em>x</em>.) </p>\n<p>Then with this notation an example of a “mathematical statement” might be: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/04-sw0219img1.png\" alt='' title='' width='170' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/04-sw0219img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='04-1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='04-1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In more explicit form we could write this as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Equal.html'>Equal</a>[f[x_, y_], f[f[y_, x_],y_]]</tt>&mdash;where <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Equal.html'>Equal</a></tt> (<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-equalA.png\" width= '13' height='23' align='absmiddle'></span>) has the “known meaning” of representing equality.

But what if we are given a statement, and asked whether it can be proved within the specified axiom system? In effect this asks whether if we make a sufficiently large multiway graph we can find a path of any length that corresponds to the statement.</p>\n<p>If our system was computationally reducible we could expect always to be able to find a finite answer to this question. But in general—with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> and the ubiquitous presence of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>—it’ll be common that there is no fundamentally better way to determine whether a path exists than effectively to try explicitly generating it. If we knew, for example, that the intermediate expressions generated always remained of bounded length, then this would still be a bounded problem.

The fact that the multiway graph is infinite then tells us that there are an infinite number of equivalences between words.</p>\n<p>But when we think about the semigroup mathematically we’re typically not so interested in specific words as in the overall “distinct elements” in the semigroup, or in other words, in those “clusters of words” that don’t have equivalences between them. And to find these we can imagine starting with all possible expressions, then building up multiway graphs from them. Many of the graphs grown from different expressions will join up. But what we want to know in the end is how many disconnected graph components are ultimately formed.

A particular proof path in the multiway graph will progressively “move around” in the branchial graph that defines metamathematical space. (Yes, there are many subtle issues here, not least the fact that one has to imagine a certain kind of limit being taken so that the structure of the branchial graph is “stable enough” to “just be moving around” in something like a “fixed background space”.)</p>\n<p>By the way, the shortest proof path in the multiway graph is the analog of a geodesic in spacetime. And later we’ll talk about how the “density of activity” in the branchial graph is the analog of energy in physics, and how it can be seen as “deflecting” the path of geodesics, just as gravity does in spacetime.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning just one further subtlety. Branchial graphs are in effect associated with <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/foliations-of-the-multiway-graph-and-the-structure-of-branchial-space/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“transverse slices”</a> of the multiway graph—but there are many consistent ways to make these slices. In physics terms one can think of the foliations that define different choices of sequences of slices as being like “reference frames” in which one is specifying a sequence of “simultaneity surfaces” (here “branchtime hypersurfaces”). The particular branchial graphs we’ve shown here are ones associated with what in physics might be called the cosmological rest frame in which every node is the result of the same number of updates since the beginning.</p>\n<h2 id='the-issue-of-generated-variables'><span>6 | </span>The Issue of Generated Variables</h2>\n<p>A rule like</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img1A.png\" alt='' title='' width='172' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>defines transformations for any expressions <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img2A.png\" width= '18' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img3A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>.

But what should we make of those <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img13A.png\" width= '17' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>’s? And in particular, are they “the same”, or not? </p>\n<p>A pattern variable like <em>z</em>_ can stand for any expression. But do two different <em>z</em>_’s have to stand for the same expression? In a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img14A.png\" width= '45' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>&nbsp;<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width= '20' height='24' align='absmiddle'></span>&nbsp;&#8230; we’re assuming that, yes, the two <em>z</em>_’s always stand for the same expression. But if the <em>z</em>_’s appear in different rules it’s a different story. Because in that case we’re dealing with two separate and unconnected <em>z</em>_’s—that can stand for completely different expressions.</p>\n<p>To begin seeing how this works, let’s start with a very simple example. Consider the (for now, one-way) rule</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img15A.png\" alt='' title='' width='76' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img15_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='15-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='15-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>where <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img16A.png\" width='9' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is the literal symbol <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img17A.png\" width= '9' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, and <em>x</em>_ is a pattern variable. Applying this to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img18A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we might think we could just write the result as:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img19A.png\" alt='' title='' width='222' height='94' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Then if we apply the rule again both branches will give the same expression <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img20A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, so there’ll be a merge in the multiway graph:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img21A.png\" alt='' title='' width='222' height='165' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But is this really correct? Well, no. Because really those should be two different <em>x</em>_’s, that could stand for two different expressions. So how can we indicate this? One approach is just to give every “generated” <em>x</em>_ a new name: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img22A.png\" alt='' title='' width='404' height='176' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img22_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='22-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='22-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But this result isn’t really correct either. Because if we look at the second step we see the two expressions <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img23A.png\" width= '63' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img24A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. But what’s really the difference between these? The names <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img25A.png\" width= '13' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> are arbitrary; the only constraint is that within any given expression they have to be different. But between expressions there’s no such constraint. And in fact <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img26A.png\" width= '63' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img27A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> both represent exactly the same class of expressions: any expression of the form <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img28A.png\" width= '49' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. </p>\n<p>So in fact it’s not correct that there are two separate branches of the multiway system producing two separate expressions. Because those two branches produce equivalent expressions, which means they can be merged. And turning both equivalent expressions into the same canonical form we get:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img29A.png\" alt='' title='' width='222' height='175' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img29_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='29-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='29-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s important to notice that this isn’t the same result as what we got when we assumed that every <em>x</em>_ was the same. Because then our final result was the expression <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img30A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> which can match <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img31A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> but not <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img32A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>—whereas now the final result is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img33A.png\" width= '49' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> which can match both <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img34A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img35A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>This may seem like a subtle issue. But it’s critically important in practice. Not least because generated variables are in effect what make up all “truly new stuff” that can be produced. With a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img36A.png\" width= '165' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> one’s essentially just taking whatever one started with, and successively rearranging the pieces of it. But with a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img37A.png\" width= '163' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> there’s something “truly new” generated every time <em>z</em>_ appears. </p>\n<p>By the way, the basic issue of “generated variables” isn’t something specific to the particular symbolic expression setup we’ve been using here. For example, there’s a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-in-our-models/updating-events-and-causal-dependence/' target=_blank rel=noopener>direct analog of it in the hypergraph rewriting systems</a> that appear in our Physics Project. But in that case there’s a particularly clear interpretation: the analog of “generated variables” are new “atoms of space” produced by the application of rules. And far from being some kind of footnote, these “generated atoms of space” are what make up everything we have in our universe today. </p>\n<p>The issue of generated variables—and especially their naming—is the bane of all sorts of formalism for mathematical logic and programming languages. As we’ll see later, it’s perfectly possible to “go to a lower level” and set things up with no names at all, for example using <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>combinators</a>. But without names, things tend to seem quite alien to us humans—and certainly if we want to understand the correspondence with standard presentations of mathematics it’s pretty necessary to have names. So at least for now we’ll keep names, and handle the issue of generated variables by uniquifying their names, and canonicalizing every time we have a complete expression.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at another example to see the importance of how we handle generated variables. Consider the rule:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img38A.png\" alt='' title='' width='138' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img38_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='38-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='38-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a name='uniquification'></a>If we start with <em>a</em>&nbsp;∘&nbsp;<em>a</em> and do no uniquification, we’ll get:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img39A.png\" alt='' title='' width='409' height='244' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img39_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='39-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='39-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With uniquification, but not canonicalization, we’ll get a pure tree:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img40A.png\" alt='' title='' width='551' height='191' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img40_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='40-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='40-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But with canonicalization this is reduced to:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img41A.png\" alt='' title='' width='484' height='190' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img41_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='41-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='41-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A confusing feature of this particular example is that this same result would have been obtained just by canonicalizing the original “assume-all-<em>x</em>_’s-are-the-same” case. </p>\n<p>But things don’t always work this way.

The “two-way rules” we’ve been using effectively define equivalences—which are very common kinds of statements in mathematics, though in mathematics they’re usually written with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-equalA.png\" width= '13' height='23' align='absmiddle'></span> rather than with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/double-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width='20' height='22' align='absmiddle'></span>. And indeed, many axioms and many theorems are specified as equivalences—and in equational logic one takes everything to be defined using equivalences. And when one’s dealing with theorems (or axioms) specified as equivalences, the basic way one derives new theorems is by applying one theorem to another—or in effect by applying rules to rules.</p>\n<p>As a specific example, let’s say we have the “axiom”:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img3A.png\" alt='' title='' width='172' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We can now apply this to the rule</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img4A.png\" alt='' title='' width='106' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>to get (where since <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img5A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is equivalent to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img6A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we’re sorting each two-way rule that arises)</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img7A.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='177' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>or after a few more steps:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img8A.png\" alt='' title='' width='552' height='312' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='8-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='8-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In this example all that’s happening is that the substitutions specified by the axiom are getting separately applied to the left- and right-hand sides of each rule that is generated.

But in an effort to maintain contact with standard mathematics we’ll for now have the “meta rule” that <em>x</em>_ can’t match an expression whose top-level operator is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width='20' height='24' align='absmiddle'></span>. (As we’ll discuss later, including such matches would allow us to do exotic things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p815--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>encode set theory within arithmetic</a>, which is again something usually considered to be “syntactically prevented” in mathematical logic.)</p>\n<p>Another—still more obscure—meta rule we have is that <em>x</em>_ can’t “match inside a variable”. In Wolfram Language, for example, <em>a</em>_ has the full form <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Pattern.html'>Pattern</a>[a,<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Blank.html'>Blank</a>[]]</tt>, and one could imagine that <em>x</em>_ could match “internal pieces” of this. But for now, we’re going to treat all variables as atomic—even though later on, when we “descend below the level of variables”, the story will be different. </p>\n<p>When we apply a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img13A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img14A.png\" width= '87' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we’re taking a rule with pattern variables, and doing substitutions with it on a “literal expression” without pattern variables. But it’s also perfectly possible to apply pattern rules to pattern rules<span style=\"font-size:14px\">&mdash;</span>and indeed that’s what we’ll mostly do below. But in this case there’s another subtle issue that can arise. Because if our rule generates variables, we can end up with two different kinds of variables with “arbitrary names”: generated variables, and pattern variables from the rule we’re operating on. And when we canonicalize the names of these variables, we can end up with identical expressions that we need to merge.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens if we apply the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img15A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> to the literal rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img16A.png\" width= '67' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img17A.png\" alt='' title='' width='404' height='74' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img17_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If we apply it to the pattern rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img18A.png\" width= '97' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> but don’t do canonicalization, we’ll just get the same basic result:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img19A.png\" alt='' title='' width='474' height='79' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But if we canonicalize we get instead: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img20A.png\" alt='' title='' width='474' height='71' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img20_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='20-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='20-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The effect is more dramatic if we go to two steps.

actually work in very different ways. The string rule can apply to characters anywhere within a string, but what it inserts is always of fixed size. The expression rule deals with trees, and only applies to “whole subtrees”, but what it inserts can be a tree of any size. (One can align these setups by thinking of strings as expressions in which characters are “bound together” by an associative operator, as in A·B·A·A. But if one explicitly gives associativity axioms these will lead to additional pieces in the token-event graph.)</p>\n<p>A rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/10sw0223img14A.png\" width= '97' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> also has the feature of involving patterns.

The proof is a subgraph of the “relevant part” of the full token-event graph. Often—in analogy to the simpler case of finding proofs of equivalences between expressions in a multiway graph—we’ll call this subgraph a “proof path”. </p>\n<p>But in addition to just “finding a proof” in a fully constructed token-event graph, we can ask whether, given a statement, we can directly construct a proof for it. As discussed in the context of proofs in ordinary multiway graphs, computational irreducibility implies that in general there’s no “shortcut” way to find a proof. In addition, for any statement, there may be no upper bound on the length of proof that will be required (or on the size or number of intermediate “lemmas” that will have to be used). And this, again, is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p779--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>shadow of undecidability in our systems</a>: that there can be statements whose provability may be arbitrarily difficult to determine. </p>\n<h2 id='beyond-substitution-cosubstitution-and-bisubstitution'><span>12 | </span>Beyond Substitution: Cosubstitution and Bisubstitution</h2>\n<p>In making our “metamodel” of mathematics we’ve been discussing the rewriting of expressions according to rules. But there’s a subtle issue that we’ve so far avoided, that has to do with the fact that the expressions we’re rewriting are often themselves patterns that stand for whole classes of expressions. And this turns out to allow for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--substitution-strategies-in-proofs/'>additional kinds of transformations</a> that we’ll call cosubstitution and bisubstitution.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk first about cosubstitution. Imagine we have the expression <tt>f[a]</tt>. The rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img1A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> would do a substitution for <em>a</em> to give <tt>f[b]</tt>. But if we have the expression <tt>f[c]</tt> the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img2A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> will do nothing.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that we have the expression <tt>f[x_]</tt>. This stands for a whole class of expressions, including <tt>f[a]</tt>, <tt>f[c]</tt>, etc. For most of this class of expressions, the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img3A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> will do nothing. But in the specific case of <tt>f[a]</tt>, it applies, and gives the result <tt>f[b]</tt>.</p>\n<p>If our rule is <tt>f[x_]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> then this will apply as an ordinary substitution to <tt>f[a]</tt>, giving the result <em>s</em>. But if the rule is <tt>f[b]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> this will not apply as an ordinary substitution to <tt>f[a]</tt>. However, it can apply as a cosubstitution to <tt>f[x_]</tt> by picking out the specific case where <tt>x_</tt> stands for <em>b</em>, then using the rule to give <em>s</em>.</p>\n<p>In general, the point is that ordinary substitution specializes patterns that appear in rules—while what one can think of as the “dual operation” of cosubstitution specializes patterns that appear in the expressions to which the rules are being applied. If one thinks of the rule that’s being applied as like an operator, and the expression to which the rule is being applied as an operand, then in effect substitution is about making the operator fit the operand, and cosubstitution is about making the operand fit the operator.</p>\n<p>It’s important to realize that as soon as one’s operating on expressions involving patterns, cosubstitution is not something “optional”: it’s something that one has to include if one is really going to interpret patterns—wherever they occur—as standing for classes of expressions.</p>\n<p>When one’s operating on a literal expression (without patterns) only substitution is ever possible, as in</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img4A.png\" alt='' title='' width='201' height='27' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/13sw0223img4X_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4X-13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4X-13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>corresponding to this fragment of a token-event graph:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img5A.png\" alt='' title='' width='546' height='118' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/13sw0223img5X_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5-13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5-13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Let’s say we have the rule <tt>f[a]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> (where <tt>f[a]</tt> is a literal expression).

But typical strategies for automated theorem proving don’t naturally produce such graphs. In principle automated theorem proving could work by directly searching for a “path” that leads to the theorem one’s trying to prove. But usually it’s much easier instead to have as the “target” a simple tautology.</p>\n<p>At least conceptually automated theorem proving must still try to “navigate” through the full token-event graph that makes up the entailment cone. And the main issue in doing this is that there are many places where one does not know “which branch to take”. But here there’s a crucial—if at first surprising—fact: at least so long as one is using full bisubstitution it ultimately doesn’t matter which branch one takes; there’ll always be a way to “merge back” to any other branch.</p>\n<p>This is a consequence of the fact that the accumulative systems we’re using automatically have the property of confluence which says that every branch is accompanied by a subsequent merge. There’s an almost trivial way in which this is true by virtue of the fact that for every edge the system also includes the reverse of that edge. But there’s a more substantial reason as well: that given any two statements on two different branches, there’s always a way to combine them using a bisubstitution to get a single statement.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal invariance</a>—which effectively generalizes confluence—is an important one, that leads among other things to ideas like relativistic invariance. Later on we’ll discuss the idea that “regardless of what order you prove theorems in, you’ll always get the same math”, and its relationship to causal invariance and to the notion of relativity in metamathematics. But for now the importance of confluence is that it has the potential to simplify automated theorem proving—because in effect it says one can never ultimately “make a wrong turn” in getting to a particular theorem, or, alternatively, that if one keeps going long enough every path one might take will eventually be able to reach every theorem. </p>\n<p>And indeed this is exactly how things work in the full entailment cone. But the challenge in automated theorem proving is to generate only a tiny part of the entailment cone, yet still “get to” the theorem we want. And in doing this we have to carefully choose which “branches” we should try to merge using bisubstitution events. In automated theorem proving these bisubstitution events are typically called “critical pair lemmas”, and there are a variety of strategies for defining an order in which critical pair lemmas should be tried. </p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that there’s absolutely no guarantee that such procedures will find the shortest proof of any given theorem (or in fact that they’ll find a proof at all with a given amount of computational effort). One can imagine “higher-order proofs” in which one attempts to transform not just statements of the form <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/15sw0224img24A.png\" width= '64' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, but full proofs (say represented as token-event graphs). And one can imagine <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04057.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>using such transformations to try to simplify proofs</a>. </p>\n<p>A general feature of the proofs we’ve been showing is that they are accumulative, in the sense they continually introduce lemmas which are then reused. But in principle any proof can be “unrolled” into one that just repeatedly uses the original axioms (and in fact, purely by substitution)—and never introduces other lemmas. The necessary “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--proof-structures/'>cut elimination</a>” can effectively be done by always recreating each lemma from the axioms whenever it’s needed—a process which can become exponentially complex.</p>\n<p>As an example, from the axiom above we can generate the proof</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/15sw0224img25A.png\" alt='' title='' width='484' height='464' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/15sw0224img25_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='25-15_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='25-15_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>where for example the first lemma at the top is reused in four events.

Yes, it can provide incontrovertible evidence that a theorem is valid. But that evidence is typically far away from being any kind of “narrative” suitable for human consumption. In the analogy to molecular dynamics, an automated proof gives detailed “turn-by-turn instructions” that show how a molecule can reach a certain place in a gas. Typical “human-style” mathematics, on the other hand, operates on a higher level, analogous to talking about overall motion in a fluid. And a core part of what&#8217;s achieved by our physicalization of metamathematics is understanding why it&#8217;s possible for mathematical observers like us to perceive mathematics as operating at this higher level.</p>\n<h2 id='axiom-systems-of-present-day-mathematics'><span>15 | </span>Axiom Systems of Present-Day Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The axiom systems we’ve been talking about so far were chosen largely for their axiomatic simplicity.

We can think of an axiom system as defining a collection of abstract constraints. But what can we say about objects that might satisfy those constraints? A model is in effect telling us about these objects. Or, put another way, it’s telling what “things” the axiom system “describes”.

Well, yes. They essentially correspond to (representations of) particular finite groups. The original axioms define constraints to be satisfied by any group. These models now correspond to particular groups with specific finite numbers of elements (and in fact specific representations of these groups). And just like in the Boolean algebra case this interpretation now allows us to start saying what the models are “about”. The first three, for example, correspond to cyclic groups which can be thought of as being “about” addition of integers mod <em>k</em>.</p>\n<p>For axiom systems that haven’t traditionally been studied in mathematics, there typically won’t be any such preexisting identification of what they’re “about”. But we can still think of models as being a way that a mathematical observer can characterize—or summarize—an axiom system. And in a sense we can see the collection of possible finite models for an axiom system as being a kind of “model signature” for the axiom system.</p>\n<p>But let’s now consider what models tell us about “theorems” associated with a given axiom system.

But for the non-valid models, different “patches” in the entailment cone are tagged with different codes. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we’re trying to see if two expressions are equal according to the underlying axiom system. The definitive way to tell this is to find a “proof path” from one expression to the other. But as an “approximation” we can just “evaluate” these two expressions according to a model, and see if the resulting codes are the same. Even if it’s a valid model, though, this can only definitively tell us that two expressions aren’t equal; it can’t confirm that they are. In principle we can refine things by checking in multiple models—particularly ones with more elements. But without essentially pre-checking all possible equalities we can’t in general be sure that this will give us the complete story.</p>\n<p>Of course, generating explicit proofs from the underlying axiom system can also be hard—because in general the proof can be arbitrarily long. And in a sense there is a tradeoff. Given a particular equivalence to check we can either search for a path in the entailment graph, often effectively having to try many possibilities. Or we can “do the work up front” by finding a model or collection of models that we know will correctly tell us whether the equivalence is correct.</p>\n<p>Later we’ll see how these choices relate to how mathematical observers can “parse” the structure of metamathematical space. In effect observers can either explicitly try to trace out “proof paths” formed from sequences of abstract symbolic expressions—or they can “globally predetermine” what expressions “mean” by identifying some overall model. In general there may be many possible choices of models—and what we’ll see is that these different choices are essentially analogous to different choices of reference frames in physics.</p>\n<p>One feature of our discussion of models so far is that we’ve always been talking about making models for axioms, and then applying these models to expressions. But in the accumulative systems we’ve discussed above (and that seem like closer metamodels of actual mathematics), we’re only ever talking about “statements”—with “axioms” just being statements we happen to start with.

Yes, one wants to know that a theorem has a proof (and perhaps the proof will be helpful in understanding the theorem), but the main focus is on theorems and not on proofs. In our effort to “go underneath” mathematics, however, we want to study not only what theorems there are, but also the process by which the theorems are reached. We can view it as an important simplifying assumption of typical mathematical observers that all that matters is theorems—and that different proofs aren’t relevant.

But in the middle it breaks into multiple disconnected components—in effect reflecting the emergence of multiple distinct regions of metamathematical space with something like event horizons temporarily existing between them.</p>\n<p>How should we interpret this? First and foremost, it’s something that reveals that there’s structure “below” the “fluid dynamics” level of mathematics; it’s something that depends on the discrete “axiomatic infrastructure” of metamathematics. And from the point of view of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>, we can think of it as a kind of metamathematical analog of a “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/basic-concepts-of-quantum-mechanics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>quantum effect</a>”.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine different paths in the multiway system to correspond to different possible quantum histories. The observer is in effect spread over multiple paths, which they coarse grain or conflate together. An “observable quantum effect” occurs when there are paths that can be followed by the system, but that are somehow “too far apart” to be immediately coarse-grained together by the observer. </p>\n<p>Put another way, there is “noticeable quantum interference” when the different paths corresponding to different histories that are “simultaneously happening” are “far enough apart” to be distinguished by the observer. “Destructive interference” is presumably associated with paths that are so far apart that to conflate them would effectively require conflating essentially every possible path. (And <a href='#the-notion-of-truth'>our later discussion</a> of the relationship between falsity and the “principle of explosion” then suggests a connection between destructive interference in physics and falsity in mathematics.) </p>\n<p>In essence what determines the extent of “quantum effects” is then our “size” as observers in branchial space relative to the size of features in branchial space such as the “topological holes” we’ve been discussing. In the metamathematical case, the “size” of us as observers is in effect related to our ability (or choice) to distinguish slight differences in axiomatic formulations of things. And what we’re saying here is that when there is nontrivial topology in proof space, there is an intrinsic dynamics in metamathematical entailment that leads to the development of distinctions at some scale—though whether these become “visible” to us as mathematical observers depends on how “strong a metamathematical microscope” we choose to use relative to the scale of the “topological holes”.</p>\n<h2 id='time-timelessness-and-entailment-fabrics'><span>19 | </span>Time, Timelessness and Entailment Fabrics</h2>\n<p>A fundamental feature of our metamodel of mathematics is the idea that a given set of mathematical statements can entail others. But in this picture what does “mathematical progress” look like?</p>\n<p>In analogy with physics one might imagine it would be like the evolution of the universe through time. One would start from some limited set of axioms and then—in a kind of “mathematical Big Bang”—these would lead to a progressively larger entailment cone containing more and more statements of mathematics. And in analogy with physics, one could imagine that the process of following chains of successive entailments in the entailment cone would correspond to the passage of time.</p>\n<p>But realistically this isn’t how most of the actual history of human mathematics has proceeded. Because people—and even their computers—basically never try to extend mathematics by axiomatically deriving all possible valid mathematical statements. Instead, they come up with particular mathematical statements that for one reason or another they think are valid and interesting, then try to prove these.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the proof may be difficult, and may involve a long chain of entailments. Occasionally—especially if automated theorem proving is used—the entailments may approximate a geodesic path all the way from the axioms. But the practical experience of human mathematics tends to be much more about identifying “nearby statements” and then trying to “fit them together” to deduce the statement one’s interested in.</p>\n<p>And in general human mathematics seems to progress not so much through the progressive “time evolution” of an entailment graph as through the assembly of what one might call an “entailment fabric” in which different statements are being knitted together by entailments.</p>\n<p>In physics, the analog of the entailment graph is basically the causal graph which builds up over time to define the content of a light cone (or, more accurately, an entanglement cone). The analog of the entailment fabric is basically the (more-or-less) instantaneous state of space (or, more accurately, branchial space). </p>\n<p>In our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> we typically take our lowest-level structure to be a hypergraph—and informally we often say that this <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>hypergraph “represents the structure of space”</a>. But really we should be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/#causal-balls-vs-geodesic-balls'>deducing the “structure of space”</a> by taking a particular time slice from the “dynamic evolution” represented by the causal graph—and for example we should think of two “atoms of space” as “being connected” in the “instantaneous state of space” if there’s a causal connection between them defined within the slice of the causal graph that occurs within the time slice we’re considering. In other words, the “structure of space” is knitted together by the causal connections represented by the causal graph. (In traditional physics, we might say that space can be “mapped out” by looking at overlaps between lots of little light cones.)</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how this works out in our metamathematical setting, using string rewrites to simplify things.

Yes, this structure can in principle be viewed as part of the branchial graph obtained from a slice of an entailment graph (and technically this will be a useful way to think about it). But a different view—closer to the practice of human mathematics—is that it’s a “fabric” formed by fitting together many different mathematical statements. It’s not something where one’s tracking the overall passage of time, and seeing causal connections between things—as one might in “running a program”. Rather, it’s something where one’s fitting pieces together in order to satisfy <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p210--systems-based-on-constraints/'>constraints—as one might in creating a tiling</a>.</p>\n<p>Underneath everything is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. And entailment cones and entailment fabrics can be thought of just as different samplings or slicings of the ruliad. The ruliad is ultimately the entangled limit of all possible computations. But one can think of it as being built up by starting from all possible rules and initial conditions, then running them for an infinite number of steps. An entailment cone is essentially a “slice” of this structure where one’s looking at the “time evolution” from a particular rule and initial condition. An entailment fabric is an “orthogonal” slice, looking “at a particular time” across different rules and initial conditions. (And, by the way, rules and initial conditions are essentially equivalent, particularly in an accumulative system.)</p>\n<p>One can think of these different slices of the ruliad as being what different kinds of observers will perceive within the ruliad. Entailment cones are essentially what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers who persist through time</a> but are localized in rulial space will perceive. Entailment fabrics are what observers who ignore time but explore more of rulial space will perceive. </p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>Elsewhere I’ve argued</a> that a crucial part of what makes us perceive the laws of physics we do is that we are observers who consider ourselves to be persistent through time. But now we’re seeing that in the way human mathematics is typically done, the “mathematical observer” will be of a different character. And whereas for a physical observer what’s crucial is causality through time, for a mathematical observer (at least one who’s doing mathematics the way it’s usually done) what seems to be crucial is some kind of consistency or coherence across metamathematical space. </p>\n<p>In physics it’s far from obvious that a persistent observer would be possible. It could be that with all those detailed computationally irreducible processes happening down at the level of atoms of space there might be nothing in the universe that one could consider consistent through time. But the point is that there are certain “coarse-grained” attributes of the behavior that are consistent through time. And it is by concentrating on these that we end up describing things in terms of the laws of physics we know.</p>\n<p>There’s something very analogous going on in mathematics. The detailed branchial structure of metamathematical space is complicated, and presumably full of computational irreducibility. But once again there are “coarse-grained” attributes that have a certain consistency and coherence across it. And it is on these that we concentrate as human “mathematical observers”. And it is in terms of these that we end up being able to do “human-level mathematics”—in effect operating at a “fluid dynamics” level rather than a “molecular dynamics” one. </p>\n<p>The possibility of “doing physics in the ruliad” depends crucially on the fact that as physical observers we assume that we have certain persistence and coherence through time. The possibility of “doing mathematics (the way it’s usually done) in the ruliad” depends crucially on the fact that as “mathematical observers” we assume that the mathematical statements we consider will have a certain coherence and consistency—or, in effect, that it’s possible for us to maintain and grow a coherent body of mathematical knowledge, even as we try to include all sorts of new mathematical statements. </p>\n<h2 id='the-notion-of-truth'><span>20 | </span>The Notion of Truth</h2>\n<p>Logic was originally conceived as a way to characterize human arguments—in which the concept of “truth” has always seemed quite central. And when logic was applied to the foundations of mathematics, “truth” was also usually assumed to be quite central. But the way we’ve modeled mathematics here has been much more about what statements can be derived (or entailed) than about any kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--truth-and-falsity-in-formal-systems/'>abstract notion of what statements can be “tagged as true”</a>. In other words, we’ve been more concerned with “structurally deriving” that “<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img1A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>” than in saying that “1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is true”.</p>\n<p>But what is the relation between this kind of “constructive derivation” and the logical notion of truth? We might just say that “if we can construct a statement then we should consider it true”. And if we’re starting from axioms, then in a sense we’ll never have an “absolute notion of truth”—because whatever we derive is only “as true as the axioms we started from”. </p>\n<p>One issue that can come up is that our axioms might be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p781--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>inconsistent</a>—in the sense that from them we can derive two obviously inconsistent statements. But to get further in discussing things like this we really need not only to have a notion of truth, but also a notion of falsity.</p>\n<p>In traditional logic it has tended to be assumed that truth and falsity are very much “the same kind of thing”—like 1 and 0. But one feature of our view of mathematics here is that actually truth and falsity seem to have a rather different character. And perhaps this is not surprising—because in a sense if there’s one true statement about something there are typically an infinite number of false statements about it. So, for example, the single statement <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img3A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is true, but the infinite collection of statements <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img4A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> for any other <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img5A.png\" width= '9' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> are all false. </p>\n<p>There is another aspect to this, discussed since at least the Middle Ages, often under the name of the “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion' target=_blank rel=noopener>principle of explosion</a>”: that as soon as one assumes any statement that is false, one can logically derive absolutely any statement at all. In other words, introducing a single “false axiom” will start an explosion that will eventually “blow up everything”.</p>\n<p>So within our model of mathematics we might say that things are “true” if they can be derived, and are “false” if they lead to an “explosion”. But let’s say we’re given some statement. How can we tell if it’s true or false? One thing we can do to find out if it’s true is to construct an entailment cone from our axioms and see if the statement appears anywhere in it. Of course, given computational irreducibility there’s in general no upper bound on how far we’ll need to go to determine this. But now to find out if a statement is false we can imagine introducing the statement as an additional axiom, and then seeing if the entailment cone that’s now produced contains an explosion—though once again there’ll in general be no upper bound on how far we’ll have to go to guarantee that we have a “genuine explosion” on our hands.</p>\n<p>So is there any alternative procedure? Potentially the answer is yes: we can just try to see if our statement is somehow equivalent to “true” or “false”. But in our model of mathematics where we’re just talking about transformations on symbolic expressions, there’s no immediate built-in notion of “true” and “false”. To talk about these we have to add something. And for example what we can do is to say that “true” is equivalent to what seems like an “obvious tautology” such as <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img6A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, or in our computational notation, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img7A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, while “false” is equivalent to something “obviously explosive”, like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img8A.png\" width= '65' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> (or in our particular setup something more like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img9A.png\" width= '101' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>). </p>\n<p>But even though something like “Can we find a way to reach <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img10A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> from a given statement?” seems like a much more practical question for an actual theorem-proving system than “Can we fish our statement out of a whole entailment cone?”, it runs into many of the same issues—in particular that there’s no upper limit on the length of path that might be needed.</p>\n<p>Soon we’ll return to the question of how all this relates to our interpretation of mathematics as a slice of the ruliad—and to the concept of the entailment fabric perceived by a mathematical observer. But to further set the context for what we’re doing let’s explore how what we’ve discussed so far relates to things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--godels-theorem/'>Gödel’s theorem</a>, and to phenomena like incompleteness. </p>\n<p>From the setup of basic logic we might assume that we could consider any statement to be either true or false. Or, more precisely, we might think that given a particular axiom system, we should be able to determine whether any statement that can be syntactically constructed with the primitives of that axiom system is true or false. We could explore this by asking whether every statement is either derivable or leads to an explosion—or can be proved equivalent to an “obvious tautology” or to an “obvious explosion”. </p>\n<p>But as a simple “approximation” to this, let’s consider a string rewriting system in which we define a “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p780--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>local negation operation</a>”. In particular, let’s assume that given a statement like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img11A.png\" width= '82' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> the “negation” of this statement just exchanges A and B, in this case yielding <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img12A.png\" width= '83' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s ask what statements are generated from a given axiom system. Say we start with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img13A.png\" width= '60' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.

But now let’s “negate” the statements, by exchanging A and B. And if we do this, we’ll see that there’s never a statement where both it and its negation occur. In other words, there’s no obvious inconsistency being generated within this axiom system.</p>\n<p>But if we consider instead the axiom <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img16A.png\" width= '72' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> then this gives:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img17A.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='19' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/22sw0227img17Z_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17-22_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17-22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And since this includes both <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img18A.png\" width= '71' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and its “negation” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img19A.png\" width= '73' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, by our criteria we must consider this axiom system to be inconsistent. </p>\n<p>In addition to inconsistency, we can also ask about incompleteness. For all possible statements, does the axiom system eventually generate either the statement or its negation? Or, in other words, can we always decide from the axiom system whether any given statement is true or false?</p>\n<p>With our simple assumption about negation, questions of inconsistency and incompleteness become at least in principle very simple to explore. Starting from a given axiom system, we generate its entailment cone, then we ask within this cone what fraction of possible statements, say of a given length, occur.</p>\n<p>If the answer is more than 50% we know there’s inconsistency, while if the answer is less than 50% that’s evidence of incompleteness. So what happens with different possible axiom systems?</p>\n<p>Here are some <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>results from <em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>, in each case showing both what amounts to the raw entailment cone (or, in this case, multiway system evolution from “true”), and the number of statements of a given length reached after progressively more steps:</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22-nks-p798-implications-for-mathematics-2A.png' alt='Page 798' title='Page 798' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>\n<p>At some level this is all rather straightforward. But from the pictures above we can already get a sense that there’s a problem. For most axiom systems the fraction of statements reached of a given length changes as we increase the number of steps in the entailment cone. Sometimes it’s straightforward to see what fraction will be achieved even after an infinite number of steps. But often it’s not.</p>\n<p>And in general we’ll run into computational irreducibility—so that in effect the only way to determine whether some particular statement is generated is just to go to ever more steps in the entailment cone and see what happens. In other words, there’s no guaranteed-finite way to decide what the ultimate fraction will be—and thus whether or not any given axiom system is inconsistent, or incomplete, or neither.</p>\n<p>For some axiom systems it may be possible to tell. But for some axiom systems it’s not, in effect because we don’t in general know how far we’ll have to go to determine whether a given statement is true or not. </p>\n<p>A certain amount of additional technical detail is required to reach the standard versions of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. (Note that these theorems were originally stated specifically for the Peano axioms for arithmetic, but the Principle of Computational Equivalence suggests that they’re in some sense much more general, and even ubiquitous.) But the important point here is that given an axiom system there may be statements that either can or cannot be reached—but there’s no upper bound on the length of path that might be needed to reach them even if one can.</p>\n<p>OK, so let’s come back to talking about the notion of truth in the context of the ruliad. We’ve discussed axiom systems that might show inconsistency, or incompleteness—and the difficulty of determining if they do. But the ruliad in a sense contains all possible axiom systems—and generates all possible statements.</p>\n<p>So how then can we ever expect to identify which statements are “true” and which are not? When we talked about particular axiom systems, we said that any statement that is generated can be considered true (at least with respect to that axiom system). But in the ruliad every statement is generated. So what criterion can we use to determine which we should consider “true”?</p>\n<p>The key idea is any computationally bounded observer (like us) can perceive only a tiny slice of the ruliad. And it’s a perfectly meaningful question to ask whether a particular statement occurs within that perceived slice.</p>\n<p>One way of picking a “slice” is just to start from a given axiom system, and develop its entailment cone. And with such a slice, the criterion for the truth of a statement is exactly what we discussed above: does the statement occur in the entailment cone?</p>\n<p>But how do typical “mathematical observers” actually sample the ruliad? As we discussed in the previous section, it seems to be much more by forming an entailment fabric than by developing a whole entailment cone. And in a sense progress in mathematics can be seen as a process of adding pieces to an entailment fabric: pulling in one mathematical statement after another, and checking that they fit into the fabric.</p>\n<p>So what happens if one tries to add a statement that “isn’t true”? The basic answer is that it produces an “explosion” in which the entailment fabric can grow to encompass essentially any statement. From the point of view of underlying rules—or the ruliad—there’s really nothing wrong with this. But the issue is that it’s incompatible with an “observer like us”—or with any realistic idealization of a mathematician. </p>\n<p>Our view of a mathematical observer is essentially an entity that accumulates mathematical statements into an entailment fabric. But we assume that the observer is computationally bounded, so in a sense they can only work with a limited collection of statements. So if there’s an explosion in an entailment fabric that means the fabric will expand beyond what a mathematical observer can coherently handle. Or, put another way, the only kind of entailment fabrics that a mathematical observer can reasonably consider are ones that “contain no explosions”. And in such fabrics, it’s reasonable to take the generation or entailment of a statement as a signal that the statement can be considered true.</p>\n<p>The ruliad is in a sense a unique and absolute thing. And we might have imagined that it would lead us to a unique and absolute definition of truth in mathematics. But what we’ve seen is that that’s not the case. And instead our notion of truth is something based on how we sample the ruliad as mathematical observers. But now we must explore what this means about what mathematics as we perceive it can be like.</p>\n<h2 id='what-can-human-mathematics-be-like'><span>21 | </span>What Can Human Mathematics Be Like?</h2>\n<p>The ruliad in a sense contains all structurally possible mathematics—including all mathematical statements, all axiom systems and everything that follows from them. But mathematics as we humans conceive of it is never the whole ruliad; instead it is always just some tiny part that we as mathematical observers sample.</p>\n<p>We might imagine, however, that this would mean that there is in a sense a complete arbitrariness to our mathematics—because in a sense we could just pick any part of the ruliad we want. Yes, we might want to start from a specific axiom system. But we might imagine that that axiom system could be chosen arbitrarily, with no further constraint. And that the mathematics we study can therefore be thought of as an essentially arbitrary choice, determined by its detailed history, and perhaps by cognitive or other features of humans.</p>\n<p>But there is a crucial additional issue. When we “sample our mathematics” from the ruliad we do it as mathematical observers and ultimately as humans. And it turns out that even very general features of us as mathematical observers turn out to put strong constraints on what we can sample, and how.</p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>When we discussed physics</a>, we said that the central features of observers are their computational boundedness and their assumption of their own persistence through time. In mathematics, observers are again computationally bounded. But now it is not persistence through time that they assume, but rather a certain coherence of accumulated knowledge. </p>\n<p>We can think of a mathematical observer as progressively expanding the entailment fabric that they consider to “represent mathematics”. And the question is what they can add to that entailment fabric while still “remaining coherent” as observers. In the previous section, for example, we argued that if the observer adds a statement that can be considered “logically false” then this will lead to an “explosion” in the entailment fabric. </p>\n<p>Such a statement is certainly present in the ruliad. But if the observer were to add it, then they wouldn’t be able to maintain their coherence—because, whimsically put, their mind would necessarily explode. </p>\n<p>In thinking about axiomatic mathematics it’s been standard to say that any axiom system that’s “reasonable to use” should at least be consistent (even though, yes, for a given axiom system it’s in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--consistency-in-axiom-systems/'>general ultimately undecidable</a> whether this is the case). And certainly consistency is one criterion that we now see is necessary for a “mathematical observer like us”. But one can expect that it’s not the only criterion.</p>\n<p>In other words, although it’s perfectly possible to write down any axiom system, and even start generating its entailment cone, only some axiom systems may be compatible with “mathematical observers like us”. </p>\n<p>And so, for example, something like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-4--continuum-and-cardinality/'>Continuum Hypothesis</a>—which is known to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>independent of the “established axioms” of set theory</a>—may well have the feature that, say, it has to be assumed to be true in order to get a metamathematical structure compatible with mathematical observers like us.</p>\n<p>In the case of physics, we know that the general characteristics of observers lead to certain key perceived features and laws of physics. In statistical mechanics, we’re dealing with “coarse-grained observers” who don’t trace and decode the paths of individual molecules, and therefore perceive the Second Law of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, etc. And in our Physics Project we’re also dealing with coarse-grained observers who don’t track all the details of the atoms of space, but instead perceive space as something coherent and effectively continuous. </p>\n<p>And it seems as if in metamathematics there’s something very similar going on. As we began to discuss in the <a href='#mathematics-and-physics-have-the-same-foundations'>very first section above</a>, mathematical observers tend to “coarse grain” metamathematical space. In operational terms, one way they do this is by talking about something like the Pythagorean theorem without always going down to the detailed level of axioms, and for example saying just how real numbers should be defined. And something related is that they tend to concentrate more on mathematical statements and theorems than on their proofs. <a href='#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>Later we&#8217;ll see</a> how in the context of the ruliad there’s an even deeper level to which one can go. But the point here is that in actually doing mathematics one tends to operate at the “human scale” of talking about mathematical concepts rather than the “molecular-scale details” of axioms.</p>\n<p>But why does this work? Why is one not continually “dragged down” to the detailed axiomatic level—or below? How come it’s possible to reason at what we described above as the “fluid dynamics” level, without always having to go down to the detailed “molecular dynamics” level?</p>\n<p>The basic claim is that this works for mathematical observers for essentially the same reason as the perception of space works for physical observers. With the “coarse-graining” characteristics of the observer, it’s inevitable that the slice of the ruliad they sample will have the kind of coherence that allows them to operate at a higher level. In other words, mathematics can be done “at a human level” for the same basic reason that we have a “human-level experience” of space in physics.</p>\n<p>The fact that it works this way depends both on necessary features of the ruliad—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>and in general of multicomputation</a>—as well as on characteristics of us as observers. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, there are “corner cases” where what we’ve described starts to break down. In physics, for example, the “human-level experience” of space breaks down near <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>spacetime singularities</a>. And in mathematics, there are cases where for example <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p789--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>undecidability forces one to take a lower-level</a>, more axiomatic and ultimately more metamathematical view. </p>\n<p>But the point is that there are large regions of physical space—and metamathematical space—where these kinds of issues don’t come up, and where our assumptions about physical—and mathematical—observers can be maintained. And this is what ultimately allows us to have the “human-scale” views of physics and mathematics that we do.</p>\n<h2 id='going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'><span>22 | </span>Going below Axiomatic Mathematics</h2>\n<p>In the traditional view of the foundations of mathematics one imagines that axioms—say stated in terms of symbolic expressions—are in some sense the lowest level of mathematics. But thinking in terms of the ruliad suggests that in fact there is a still-lower “ur level”—a kind of analog of machine code in which everything, including axioms, is broken down into ultimate “raw computation”.</p>\n<p>Take an axiom like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img1A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>, or, in more precise computational language:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img2A.png\" alt='' title='' width='140' height='21' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/24sw0228img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2-24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2-24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Compared to everything we’re used to seeing in mathematics this looks simple. But actually it’s already got a lot in it. For example, it assumes the notion of a binary operator, which it’s in effect naming “∘”. And for example it also assumes the notion of variables, and has two distinct pattern variables that are in effect “tagged” with the names <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. </p>\n<p>So how can we define what this axiom ultimately “means”? Somehow we have to go from its essentially textual symbolic representation to a piece of actual computation. And, yes, the particular representation we’ve used here can immediately be interpreted as computation in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. But the ultimate computational concept we’re dealing with is more general than that. And in particular it can exist in any <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>universal computational system</a>.</p>\n<p>Different universal computational systems (say particular languages or CPUs or Turing machines) may have different ways to represent computations. But ultimately any computation can be represented in any of them—with the differences in representation being like different “coordinatizations of computation”.</p>\n<p>And however we represent computations there is one thing we can say for sure: all possible computations are somewhere in the ruliad. Different representations of computations correspond in effect to different coordinatizations of the ruliad. But all computations are ultimately there.</p>\n<p>For our Physics Project it’s been convenient use a “parametrization of computation” that can be thought of as being based on rewriting of hypergraphs. The elements in these hypergraphs are ultimately purely abstract, but we tend to talk about them as “atoms of space” to indicate the beginnings of our interpretation.</p>\n<p><a name='expression-rewriting'></a>It’s perfectly possible to use hypergraph rewriting as the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/equivalence-and-computation-in-our-models/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“substrate” for representing axiom systems stated in terms of symbolic expressions</a>. But it’s a bit more convenient (though ultimately equivalent) to instead use systems based on expression rewriting—or in effect tree rewriting.</p>\n<p>At the outset, one might imagine that different axiom systems would somehow have to be represented by “different rules” in the ruliad. But as one might expect from the phenomenon of universal computation, it’s actually perfectly possible to think of different axiom systems as just being specified by different “data” operated on by a single set of rules. There are many rules and structures that we could use. But one set that has the benefit of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/'>century of history</a> are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>S, K combinators</a>.</p>\n<p>The basic concept is to represent everything in terms of “combinator expressions” containing just the two objects S and K. (It’s also possible to have just one fundamental object, and indeed <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/06/1920-2020-and-a-20000-prize-announcing-the-s-combinator-challenge/'>S alone may be enough</a>.)</p>\n<p>It’s worth saying at the outset that when we go this “far down” things get pretty non-human and obscure. Setting things up in terms of axioms may already seem pedantic and low level. But going to a substrate below axioms—that we can think of as getting us to raw “atoms of existence”—will lead us to a whole other level of obscurity and complexity.

Basically what we’re seeing is that in the “raw machine code” of S, K combinators it’s possible to “find” a representation for something we consider to be a piece of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Earlier we talked about starting from structures like axiom systems and then “compiling them down” to raw machine code. But what about just “finding mathematics” in a sense “naturally occurring” in “raw machine code”? We can think of the ruliad as containing “all possible machine code”. And somewhere in that machine code must be all the conceivable “structures of mathematics”. But the question is: in the wildness of the raw ruliad, what structures can we as mathematical observers successfully pick out? </p>\n<p>The situation is quite directly analogous to what happens at multiple levels in physics. Consider for example a fluid full of molecules bouncing around. As we’ve discussed several times, observers like us usually aren’t sensitive to the detailed dynamics of the molecules. But we can still successfully pick out large-scale structures—like overall fluid motions, vortices, etc. And—much like in mathematics—we can talk about physics just at this higher level. </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project all this becomes much more extreme. For example, we imagine that space and everything in it is just a giant network of atoms of space. And now within this network we imagine that there are “repeated patterns”—that correspond to things like electrons and quarks and black holes. </p>\n<p>In a sense it is the big achievement of natural science to have managed to find these regularities so that we can describe things in terms of them, without always having to go down to the level of atoms of space. But the fact that these are the kinds of regularities we have found is also a statement about us as physical observers.</p>\n<p>And the point is that even at the level of the raw ruliad our characteristics as physical observers will inevitably lead us to such regularities. The fact that we are computationally bounded and assume ourselves to have a certain persistence will lead us to consider things that are localized and persistent—that in physics we <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/elementary-particles/' target=_blank rel=noopener>identify for example as particles</a>.</p>\n<p>And it’s very much the same thing in mathematics. As mathematical observers we’re interested in picking out from the raw ruliad “repeated patterns” that are somehow robust. But now instead of identifying them as particles, we’ll identify them as mathematical constructs and definitions. In other words, just as a repeated pattern in the ruliad might in physics be interpreted as an electron, in mathematics a repeated pattern in the ruliad might be interpreted as an integer. </p>\n<p>We might think of physics as something “emergent” from the structure of the ruliad, and now we’re thinking of mathematics the same way. And of course not only is the “underlying stuff” of the ruliad the same in both cases, but also in both cases it’s “observers like us” that are sampling and perceiving things.</p>\n<p>There are lots of analogies to the process we’re describing of “fishing constructs out of the raw ruliad”. As one example, consider the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p229--the-emergence-of-order/'>evolution of a (“class 4”) cellular automaton</a> in which <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p292--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>localized structures</a> emerge:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img26A.png\" alt='' title='' width='579' height='356' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/24sw0228img26_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='26-24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='26-24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Underneath, just as throughout the ruliad, there’s lots of detailed computation going on, with rules repeatedly getting applied to each cell. But out of all this underlying computation we can identify a certain set of persistent structures—which we can use to make a “higher-level description” that may capture the aspects of the behavior that we care about. </p>\n<p>Given an “ocean” of S, K combinator expressions, how might we set about “finding mathematics” in them? One straightforward approach is just to identify certain “mathematical properties” we want, and then go searching for S, K combinator expressions that satisfy these.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want to “search for (propositional) logic” we first need to pick combinator expressions to symbolically represent “true” and “false”. There are many pairs of expressions that will work.

Obviously any combinator expression does what it does at the level of raw combinators. But the question is whether it can be given a “higher-level”—and potentially “mathematical”—interpretation.</p>\n<p>And in a sense this is directly an issue of what a mathematical observer “perceives” in it. Does it contain some kind of robust structure—say a kind of analog for mathematics of a particle in physics? </p>\n<p>Axiom systems can be viewed as a particular way to “summarize” certain “raw machine code” in the ruliad. But from the point of a “raw coordinatization of the ruliad” like combinators there doesn’t seem to be anything immediately special about them. At least for us humans, however, they do seem to be an obvious “waypoint”. Because by distinguishing operators and variables, establishing arities for operators and introducing names for things, they reflect the kind of structure that’s familiar from human language.</p>\n<p>But now that we think of the ruliad as what’s “underneath” both mathematics and physics there’s a different path that’s suggested. With the axiomatic approach we’re effectively trying to leverage human language as a way of summarizing what’s going on. But an alternative is to leverage our direct experience of the physical world, and our perception and intuition about things like space. And as we’ll discuss later, this is likely in many ways a better “metamodel” of the way pure mathematics is actually practiced by us humans.</p>\n<p>In some sense, this goes straight from the “raw machine code” of the ruliad to “human-level mathematics”, sidestepping the axiomatic level. But given how much “reductionist” work has already been done in mathematics to represent its results in axiomatic form, there is definitely still great value in seeing how the whole axiomatic setup can be “fished out” of the “raw ruliad”.</p>\n<p>And there’s certainly no lack of complicated technical issues in doing this. As one example, how should one deal with “generated variables”? If one “coordinatizes” the ruliad in terms of something like hypergraph rewriting this is fairly straightforward: it just involves creating new elements or hypergraph nodes (which in physics would be interpreted as atoms of space). But for something like S, K combinators it’s a bit more subtle. In the examples we’ve given above, we have combinators that, when “run”, eventually reach a fixed point. But to deal with generated variables we probably also need combinators <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#combinators-in-the-wild-some-zoology'>that never reach fixed points</a>, making it considerably more complicated to identify correspondences with definite symbolic expressions.</p>\n<p>Another issue involves rules of entailment, or, in effect, the metalogic of an axiom system. In the full axiomatic setup we want to do things like create <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graphs</a>, where each event corresponds to an entailment. But what rule of entailment should be used? The underlying rules for S, K combinators, for example, define a particular choice—though they can be used to emulate others. But the ruliad in a sense contains all choices. And, once again, it’s up to the observer to “fish out” of the raw ruliad a particular “slice”—which captures not only the axiom system but also the rules of entailment used.</p>\n<p>It may be worth mentioning a slightly different existing “reductionist” approach to mathematics: the idea of describing things in terms of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Typed.html'>types</a>. A type is in effect an equivalence class that characterizes, say, all integers, or all functions from tuples of reals to truth values. But in our terms we can interpret a type as a kind of “template” for our underlying “machine code”: we can say that some piece of machine code represents something of a particular type if the machine code matches a particular pattern of some kind. And the issue is then whether that pattern is somehow robust “like a particle” in the raw ruliad.</p>\n<p>An important part of what made our Physics Project possible is the idea of going “underneath” space and time and other traditional concepts of physics. And in a sense what we’re doing here is something very similar, though for mathematics. We want to go “underneath” concepts like functions and variables, and even the very idea of symbolic expressions. In our Physics Project a convenient “parametrization” of what’s “underneath” is a hypergraph made up of elements that we often refer to as “atoms of space”. In mathematics we’ve discussed using combinators as our “parametrization” of what’s “underneath”.</p>\n<p>But what are these “made of”? We can think of them as corresponding to raw elements of metamathematics, or raw elements of computation. But in the end, they’re “made of” whatever the ruliad is “made of”. And perhaps the best description of the elements of the ruliad is that they are “atoms of existence”—the smallest units of anything, from which everything, in mathematics and physics and elsewhere, must be made. </p>\n<p><a name='eme'></a>The atoms of existence aren’t bits or points or anything like that. They’re something fundamentally lower level that’s come into focus only with our Physics Project, and particularly with the identification of the ruliad. And for our purposes here I’ll call such atoms of existence “emes” (pronounced “eemes”, like phonemes etc.). </p>\n<p>Everything in the ruliad is made of emes. The atoms of space in our Physics Project are emes. The nodes in our combinator trees are emes. An eme is a deeply abstract thing. And in a sense all it has is an identity. Every eme is distinct. We could give it a name if we wanted to, but it doesn’t intrinsically have one. And in the end the structure of everything is built up simply from relations between emes. </p>\n<h2 id='the-physicalized-laws-of-mathematics'><span>23 | </span>The Physicalized Laws of Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad suggests there is a deep connection between the foundations of mathematics and physics. And now that we have discussed how some of the familiar formalism of mathematics can “fit into” the ruliad, we are ready to use the “bridge” provided by the ruliad to start exploring how to apply some of the successes and intuitions of physics to mathematics.</p>\n<p>A foundational part of our everyday experience of physics is our perception that we live in continuous space. But our Physics Project implies that at sufficiently small scales <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>space is actually made of discrete elements</a>—and it is only because of the coarse-grained way in which we experience it that we perceive it as continuous.</p>\n<p>In mathematics—unlike physics—we’ve long thought of the foundations as being based on things like symbolic expressions that have a fundamentally discrete structure. Normally, though, the elements of those expressions are, for example, given human-recognizable names (like 2 or <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a></tt>). But what we saw in the previous section is that these recognizable forms can be thought of as existing in an “anonymous” lower-level substrate made of what we can call atoms of existence or emes.</p>\n<p>But the crucial point is that this substrate is directly based on the ruliad. And its structure is identical between the foundations of mathematics and physics. In mathematics the emes aggregate up to give us our universe of mathematical statements. In physics they aggregate up to give us our physical universe.</p>\n<p>But now the commonality of underlying “substrate” makes us realize that we should be able to take our experience of physics, and apply it to mathematics. So what is the analog in mathematics of our perception of the continuity of space in physics? We’ve discussed the idea that we can think of mathematical statements as being laid out in a metamathematical space—or, more specifically, in what we’ve called an <a href='#time-timelessness-and-entailment-fabrics'>entailment fabric</a>. We initially talked about “coordinatizing” this using axioms, but in the previous section we saw how to go “below axioms” to the level of “pure emes”. </p>\n<p>When we do mathematics, though, we’re sampling this on a much higher level. And just like as physical observers we coarse grain the emes (that we usually call “atoms of space”) that make up physical space, so too as “mathematical observers” we coarse grain the emes that make up metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>Foundational approaches to mathematics—particularly over the past century or so—have almost always been based on axioms and on their fundamentally discrete symbolic structure. But by going to a lower level and seeing the correspondence with physics we are led to consider what we might think of as a higher-level “experience” of mathematics—operating not at the “molecular dynamics” level of specific axioms and entailments, but rather at what one might call the “fluid dynamics” level of larger-scale concepts.</p>\n<p>At the outset one might not have any reason to think that this higher-level approach could consistently be applied. But this is the first big place where ideas from physics can be used. If both physics and mathematics are based on the ruliad, and if our general characteristics as observers apply in both physics and mathematics, then we can expect that similar features will emerge. And in particular, we can expect that our everyday perception of physical space as continuous will carry over to mathematics, or, more accurately, to metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>The picture is that we as mathematical observers have a certain <a href='#counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'>“size” in metamathematical space</a>. We identify concepts—like integers or the Pythagorean theorem—as “regions” in the space of possible configurations of emes (and ultimately of slices of the ruliad). At an axiomatic level we might think of ways to capture what a typical mathematician might consider “the same concept” with slightly different formalism (say, different large cardinal axioms or different models of real numbers). But when we get down to the level of emes there’ll be vastly more freedom in how we capture a given concept—so that we’re in effect using a whole region of “emic space” to do so. </p>\n<p>But now the question is what happens if we try to make use of the concept defined by this “region”? Will the “points in the region” behave coherently, or will everything be “shredded”, with different specific representations in terms of emes leading to different conclusions?</p>\n<p>The expectation is that in most cases it will work much like physical space, and that what we as observers perceive will be quite independent of the detailed underlying behavior at the level of emes. Which is why we can expect to do “higher-level mathematics”, without always having to descend to the level of emes, or even axioms.</p>\n<p>And this we can consider as the first great “physicalized law of mathematics”: that coherent higher-level mathematics is possible for us for the same reason that physical space seems coherent to observers like us. </p>\n<p>We’ve discussed several times before the analogy to the Second Law of thermodynamics—and the way it makes possible a higher-level description of things like fluids for “observers like us”. There are certainly cases where the higher-level description breaks down. Some of them may involve specific probes of molecular structure (like Brownian motion). Others may be slightly more “unwitting” (like hypersonic flow). </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we’re very interested in where similar breakdowns might occur—because they’d allow us to “see below” the traditional continuum description of space. Potential targets involve various extreme or singular configurations of spacetime, where in effect the “coherent observer” gets “shredded”, because different atoms of space “within the observer” do different things. </p>\n<p><a name='shredding-of-observers'></a>In mathematics, this kind of “shredding” of the observer will tend to be manifest in the need to “drop below” higher-level mathematical concepts, and go down to a very detailed axiomatic, metamathematical or even eme level—where computational irreducibility and phenomena like undecidability are rampant.</p>\n<p>It’s worth emphasizing that from the point of view of pure axiomatic mathematics it’s not at all obvious that higher-level mathematics should be possible. It could be that there’d be no choice but to work through every axiomatic detail to have any chance of making conclusions in mathematics. </p>\n<p>But the point is that we now know there could be exactly the same issue in physics. Because our Physics Project implies that at the lowest level our universe is effectively made of emes that have all sorts of complicated—and computationally irreducible—behavior. Yet we know that we don’t have to trace through all the details of this to make conclusions about what will happen in the universe—at least at the level we normally perceive it. </p>\n<p>In other words, the fact that we can successfully have a “high-level view” of what happens in physics is something that fundamentally has the same origin as the fact that we can successfully have a high-level view of what happens in mathematics. Both are just features of how observers like us sample the ruliad that underlies both physics and mathematics.</p>\n<h2 id='uniformity-and-motion-in-metamathematical-space'><span>24 | </span>Uniformity and Motion in Metamathematical Space</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed how the basic concept of space as we experience it in physics leads us to our first great physicalized law of mathematics—and how this provides for the very possibility of higher-level mathematics. But this is just the beginning of what we can learn from thinking about the correspondences between physical and metamathematical space implied by their common origin in the structure of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>A key idea is to think of a limit of mathematics in which one is dealing with so many mathematical statements that one can treat them “in bulk”—as forming something we could consider a continuous metamathematical space. But what might this space be like?</p>\n<p>Our experience of physical space is that at our scale and with our means of perception it seems to us for the most part quite simple and uniform. And this is deeply connected to the concept that pure motion is possible in physical space—or, in other words, that it’s possible for things to move around in physical space without fundamentally changing their character.</p>\n<p>Looked at from the point of view of the atoms of space it’s not at all obvious that this should be possible. After all, whenever we move we’ll almost inevitably be made up of different atoms of space. But it’s fundamental to our character as observers that the features we end up perceiving are ones that have a certain persistence—so that we can imagine that we, and objects around us, can just “move unchanged”, at least with respect to those aspects of the objects that we perceive. And this is why, for example, we can discuss laws of mechanics without having to “drop down” to the level of the atoms of space.</p>\n<p>So what’s the analog of all this in metamathematical space? At the present stage of our physical universe, we seem to be able to experience physical space as having features like being basically three-dimensional. Metamathematical space probably doesn’t have such familiar mathematical characterizations. But it seems very likely (and we’ll see some evidence of this from <a href='#empirical-metamathematics'>empirical metamathematics below</a>) that at the very least we’ll perceive metamathematical space as having a certain uniformity or homogeneity.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine that we can think of physical space as <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/cosmology-expansion-and-singularities/' target=_blank rel=noopener>beginning “at the Big Bang”</a> with what amounts to some small collection of atoms of space, but then growing to the vast number of atoms in our current universe through the repeated application of particular rules. But with a small set of rules being applied a vast number of times, it seems almost inevitable that some kind of uniformity must result.</p>\n<p>But then the same kind of thing can be expected in metamathematics. In axiomatic mathematics one imagines the mathematical analog of the Big Bang: everything starts from a small collection of axioms, and then expands to a huge number of mathematical statements through repeated application of laws of inference. And from this picture (which gets a bit more elaborate when one considers emes and the full ruliad) one can expect that at least after it’s “developed for a while” metamathematical space, like physical space, will have a certain uniformity.</p>\n<p>The idea that physical space is somehow uniform is something we take very much for granted, not least because that’s our lifelong experience. But the analog of this idea for metamathematical space is something we don’t have immediate everyday intuition about—and that in fact may at first seem surprising or even bizarre. But actually what it implies is something that increasingly rings true from modern experience in pure mathematics. Because by saying that metamathematical space is in a sense uniform, we’re saying that different parts of it somehow seem similar—or in other words that there’s parallelism between what we see in different areas of mathematics, even if they’re not “nearby” in terms of entailments.</p>\n<p>But this is exactly what, for example, the success of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--category-theory/'>category theory</a> implies. Because it shows us that even in completely different areas of mathematics it makes sense to set up the same basic structures of objects, morphisms and so on. As such, though, category theory defines only the barest outlines of mathematical structure. But what our concept of perceived uniformity in metamathematical space suggests is that there should in fact be closer correspondences between different areas of mathematics.</p>\n<p>We can view this as another fundamental “physicalized law of mathematics”: that different areas of mathematics should ultimately have structures that are in some deep sense “perceived the same” by mathematical observers. For several centuries we’ve known there’s a certain correspondence between, for example, geometry and algebra. But it’s been a major achievement of recent mathematics to identify more and more such correspondences or “dualities”. </p>\n<p>Often the existence of these has seemed remarkable, and surprising. But what our view of metamathematics here suggests is that this is actually a general physicalized law of mathematics—and that in the end essentially all different areas of mathematics must share a deep structure, at least in some appropriate “bulk metamathematical limit” when enough statements are considered.</p>\n<p>But it’s one thing to say that two places in metamathematical space are “similar”; it’s another to say that “motion between them” is possible. Once again we can make an analogy with physical space. We’re used to the idea that we can move around in space, maintaining our identity and structure. But this in a sense requires that we can maintain some kind of continuity of existence on our path between two positions.</p>\n<p>In principle it could have been that we would have to be “atomized” at one end, then “reconstituted” at the other end. But our actual experience is that we perceive ourselves to continually exist all the way along the path. In a sense this is just an assumption about how things work that physical observers like us make; but what’s nontrivial is that the underlying structure of the ruliad implies that this will always be consistent.</p>\n<p>And so we expect it will be in metamathematics. Like a physical observer, the way a mathematical observer operates, it’ll be possible to “move” from one area of mathematics to another “at a high level”, without being “atomized” along the way. Or, in other words, that a mathematical observer will be able to make correspondences between different areas of mathematics without having to go down to the level of emes to do so.</p>\n<p>It’s worth realizing that as soon as there’s a way of representing mathematics in computational terms the concept of universal computation (and, more tightly, the Principle of Computational Equivalence) implies that at some level there must always be a way to translate between any two mathematical theories, or any two areas of mathematics. But the question is whether it’s possible to do this in “high-level mathematical terms” or only at the level of the underlying “computational substrate”. And what we’re saying is that there’s a general physicalized law of mathematics that implies that higher-level translation should be possible.</p>\n<p>Thinking about mathematics at a traditional axiomatic level can sometimes obscure this, however. For example, in axiomatic terms we usually think of Peano arithmetic as not being as powerful as ZFC set theory (for example, it lacks <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--universality-of-set-theory/'>transfinite induction</a>)—and so nothing like “dual” to it. But Peano arithmetic can perfectly well support universal computation, so inevitably a “formal emulator” for ZFC set theory can be built in it. But the issue is that to do this essentially requires going down to the “atomic” level and operating not in terms of mathematical constructs but instead directly in terms of “metamathematical” symbolic structure (and, for example, explicitly emulating things like equality predicates).</p>\n<p>But the issue, it seems, is that if we think at the traditional axiomatic level, we’re not dealing with a “mathematical observer like us”. In the analogy we’ve used above, we’re operating at the “molecular dynamics” level, not at the human-scale “fluid dynamics” level. And so we see all sorts of details and issues that ultimately won’t be relevant in typical approaches to actually doing pure mathematics. </p>\n<p>It’s somewhat ironic that our physicalized approach shows this by going below the axiomatic level—to the level of emes and the raw ruliad. But in a sense it’s only at this level that there’s the uniformity and coherence to conveniently construct a general picture that can encompass observers like us.</p>\n<p>Much as with ordinary matter we can say that “everything is made of atoms”, we’re now saying that everything is “made of computation” (and its structure and behavior is ultimately described by the ruliad). But the crucial idea that emerged from our Physics Project—and that is at the core of what I’m calling the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>—is that when we ask what observers perceive there is a whole additional level of inexorable structure. And this is what makes it possible to do both human-scale physics and higher-level mathematics—and for there to be what amounts to “pure motion”, whether in physical or metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>There’s another way to think about this, that we alluded to earlier. A key feature of an observer is to have a coherent identity. In physics, that involves having a consistent thread of experience in time. In mathematics, it involves bringing together a consistent view of “what’s true” in the space of mathematical statements. </p>\n<p>In both cases the observer will in effect involve many separate underlying elements (ultimately, emes). But in order to maintain the observer’s view of having a coherent identity, the observer must somehow conflate all these elements, effectively treating them as “the same”. In physics, this means “coarse-graining” across physical or branchial (or, in fact, rulial) space. In mathematics, this means “coarse-graining” across metamathematical space—or in effect treating different mathematical statements as “the same”.</p>\n<p>In practice, there are several ways this happens. First of all, one tends to be more concerned about mathematical results than their proofs, so two statements that have the same form can be considered the same even if the proofs (or other processes) that generated them are different (and indeed this is something we have routinely done in constructing entailment cones here). But there’s more. One can also imagine that any statements that entail each other can be considered “the same”. </p>\n<p>In a simple case, this means that if <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img1A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img2A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> then one can always assume <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img3A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. But there’s a much more general version of this embodied in the <a href='https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201309/rnoti-p1164.pdf?trk=2013091164&#038;cat=collection' target=_blank rel=noopener>univalence axiom of homotopy type theory</a>—that in our terms can be interpreted as saying that mathematical observers consider equivalent things the same.</p>\n<p>There’s another way that mathematical observers conflate different statements—that’s in many ways more important, but less formal. As we mentioned above, when mathematicians talk, say, about the Pythagorean theorem, they typically think they have a definite concept in mind. But at the axiomatic level—and even more so at the level of emes—there are a huge number of different “metamathematical configurations” that are all “considered the same” by the typical working mathematician, or by our “mathematical observer”. (At the level of axioms, there might be different axiom systems for real numbers; at the level of emes there might be different ways of representing concepts like addition or equality.)</p>\n<p>In a sense we can think of mathematical observers as having a certain <a href='#counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'>“extent” in metamathematical space</a>. And much like human-scale physical observers see only the aggregate effects of huge numbers of atoms of space, so also mathematical observers see only the “aggregate effects” of huge numbers of emes of metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>But now the key question is whether a “whole mathematical observer” can “move in metamathematical space” as a single “rigid” entity, or whether it will inevitably be distorted—or shredded—by the structure of metamathematical space. In the next section we’ll discuss the analog of gravity—and curvature—in metamathematical space. But our physicalized approach tends to suggest that in “most” of metamathematical space, a typical mathematical observer will be able to “move around freely”, implying that there will indeed be paths or “bridges” between different areas of mathematics, that involve only higher-level mathematical constructs, and don’t require dropping down to the level of emes and the raw ruliad.</p>\n<h2 id='gravitational-and-relativistic-effects-in-metamathematics'><span>25 | </span>Gravitational and Relativistic Effects in Metamathematics</h2>\n<p>If metamathematical space is like physical space, does that mean that it has <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-gravity'>analogs of gravity</a>, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#deriving-special-relativity'>relativity</a>? The answer seems to be “yes”—and these provide our next examples of physicalized laws of mathematics. </p>\n<p>In the end, we’re going to be able to talk about at least gravity in a largely “static” way, referring mostly to the “instantaneous state of metamathematics”, captured as an entailment fabric. But in leveraging ideas from physics, it’s important to start off formulating things in terms of the analog of time for metamathematics—which is entailment.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, the entailment cone is the direct analog of the light cone in physics. Starting with some mathematical statement (or, more accurately, some event that transforms it) the forward entailment cone contains all statements (or, more accurately, events) that follow from it. Any possible “instantaneous state of metamathematics” then corresponds to a “transverse slice” through this entailment cone—with the slice in effect being laid out in metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>An individual entailment of one statement by another corresponds to a path in the entailment cone, and this path (or, more accurately for accumulative evolution, subgraph) can be thought of as a proof of one statement given another. And in these terms the shortest proof can be thought of as a geodesic in the entailment cone. (In practical mathematics, it’s very unlikely one will find—or care about—the strictly shortest proof. But even having a “fairly short proof” will be enough to give the general conclusions we’ll discuss here.)</p>\n<p>Given a path in the entailment cone, we can imagine projecting it onto a transverse slice, i.e. onto an entailment fabric. Being able to consistently do this depends on having a certain uniformity in the entailment cone, and in the sequence of “metamathematical hypersurfaces” that are defined by whatever “metamathematical reference frame” we’re using. But assuming, for example, that underlying computational irreducibility successfully generates a kind of “statistical uniformity” that cannot be “decoded” by the observer, we can expect to have meaningful paths—and geodesics—on entailment fabrics.</p>\n<p>But what these geodesics are like then depends on the emergent geometry of entailment fabrics. In physics, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/' target=_blank rel=noopener>limiting geometry</a> of the analog of this for physical space is presumably a fairly simple 3D manifold. For <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-forms-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space, it&#8217;s more complicated</a>, probably for example being “exponential dimensional”. And for metamathematics, the limiting geometry is also undoubtedly more complicated—and almost certainly exponential dimensional. </p>\n<p>We’ve <a href='#uniformity-and-motion-in-metamathematical-space'>argued that we expect</a> metamathematical space to have a certain perceived uniformity. But what will affect this, and therefore potentially modify the local geometry of the space? The basic answer is exactly the same as in our Physics Project. If there’s “more activity” somewhere in an entailment fabric, this will in effect lead to “more local connections”, and thus effective “positive local curvature” in the emergent geometry of the network. Needless to say, exactly what “more activity” means is somewhat subtle, especially given that the fabric in which one is looking for this is itself defining the ambient geometry, measures of “area”, etc.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we make things more precise by associating <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/matter-energy-and-gravitation/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“activity” with energy density</a>, and saying that energy effectively corresponds to the flux of causal edges through spacelike hypersurfaces. So this suggests that we think about an analog of energy in metamathematics: essentially defining it to be the density of update events in the entailment fabric. Or, put another way, energy in metamathematics depends on the “density of proofs” going through a region of metamathematical space, i.e. involving particular “nearby” mathematical statements.</p>\n<p>There are lots of caveats, subtleties and details. But the notion that “activity AKA energy” leads to increasing curvature in an emergent geometry is a general feature of the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> that the ruliad captures. And in fact we expect a quantitative relationship between energy density (or, strictly, energy-momentum) and induced curvature of the “transversal space”—that corresponds exactly to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/the-vacuum-einstein-equations/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Einstein&#8217;s equations in general relativity</a>. It’ll be more difficult to see this in the metamathematical case because metamathematical space is geometrically more complicated—and less familiar—than physical space.</p>\n<p>But even at a qualitative level, it seems very helpful to think in terms of physics and spacetime analogies. The basic phenomenon is that geodesics are deflected by the presence of “energy”, in effect being “attracted to it”. And this is why we can think of regions of higher energy (or energy-momentum/mass)—in physics and in metamathematics—as “generating gravity”, and deflecting geodesics towards them. (Needless to say, in metamathematics, as in physics, the vast majority of overall activity is just devoted to knitting together the structure of space, and when gravity is produced, it’s from slightly increased activity in a particular region.)</p>\n<p>(In our Physics Project, a key result is that the same kind of dependence of “spatial” structure on energy happens not only in physical space, but also in branchial space—where there’s a direct analog of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>general relativity that basically yields the path integral</a> of quantum mechanics.)</p>\n<p>What does this mean in metamathematics? Qualitatively, the implication is that “proofs will tend to go through where there’s a higher density of proofs”. Or, in an analogy, if you want to drive from one place to another, it’ll be more efficient if you can do at least part of your journey on a freeway.</p>\n<p>One question to ask about metamathematical space is whether one can always get from any place to any other. In other words, starting from one area of mathematics, can one somehow derive all others? A key issue here is whether the area one starts from is computation universal. Propositional logic is not, for example. So if one starts from it, one is essentially trapped, and cannot reach other areas.</p>\n<p>But results in mathematical logic have established that most traditional areas of axiomatic mathematics are in fact computation universal (and the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> suggests that this will be ubiquitous). And given computation universality there will at least be some “proof path”. (In a sense this is a reflection of the fact that the ruliad is unique, so everything is connected in “the same ruliad”.)</p>\n<p>But a big question is whether the “proof path” is “big enough” to be appropriate for a “mathematical observer like us”. Can we expect to get from one part of metamathematical space to another without the observer being “shredded”? Will we be able to start from any of a whole collection of places in metamathematical space that are considered “indistinguishably nearby” to a mathematical observer and have all of them “move together” to reach our destination? Or will different specific starting points follow quite different paths—preventing us from having a high-level (“fluid dynamics”) description of what’s going on, and instead forcing us to drop down to the “molecular dynamics” level?</p>\n<p>In practical pure mathematics, this tends to be an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>issue of whether there is an “elegant proof using high-level concepts”</a>, or whether one has to drop down to a very detailed level that’s more like low-level computer code, or the output of an automated theorem proving system. And indeed there’s a very visceral sense of “shredding” in cases where one’s confronted with a proof that consists of page after page of “machine-like details”. </p>\n<p>But there’s another point here as well. If one looks at an individual proof path, it can be computationally irreducible to find out where the path goes, and the question of whether it ever reaches a particular destination can be undecidable. But in most of the current practice of pure mathematics, one’s interested in “higher-level conclusions”, that are “visible” to a mathematical observer who doesn’t resolve individual proof paths. </p>\n<p>Later we’ll discuss the dichotomy between explorations of computational systems that routinely run into undecidability—and the typical experience of pure mathematics, where undecidability is rarely encountered in practice. But the basic point is that what a typical mathematical observer sees is at the “fluid dynamics level”, where the potentially circuitous path of some individual molecule is not relevant.</p>\n<p>Of course, by asking specific questions—about metamathematics, or, say, about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p787--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>very specific equations</a>—it’s still perfectly possible to force tracing of individual “low-level” proof paths. But this isn’t what’s typical in current pure mathematical practice. And in a sense we can see this as an extension of our first physicalized law of mathematics: not only is higher-level mathematics possible, but it’s ubiquitously so, with the result that, at least in terms of the questions a mathematical observer would readily formulate, phenomena like undecidability are not generically seen.</p>\n<p>But even though undecidability may not be directly visible to a mathematical observer, its underlying presence is still crucial in coherently “knitting together” metamathematical space. Because without undecidability, we won’t have computation universality and computational irreducibility. But—just like in our Physics Project—computational irreducibility is crucial in producing the low-level apparent randomness that is needed to support any kind of “continuum limit” that allows us to think of large collections of what are ultimately discrete emes as building up some kind of coherent geometrical space. </p>\n<p>And when undecidability is not present, one will typically not end up with anything like this kind of coherent space. An extreme example occurs in rewrite systems that eventually terminate—in the sense that they reach a “fixed-point” (or “normal form”) state where no more transformations can be applied.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, this kind of termination can be <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>interpreted as a spacelike singularity</a> at which “time stops” (as at the center of a non-rotating black hole). But in general decidability is associated with “limits on how far paths can go”—just like the limits on causal paths associated with event horizons in physics.</p>\n<p>There are many details to work out, but the qualitative picture can be developed further. In physics, the singularity theorems imply that in essence the eventual formation of spacetime singularities is inevitable. And there should be a direct analog in our context that implies the eventual formation of “metamathematical singularities”. In qualitative terms, we can expect that the presence of proof density (which is the analog of energy) will “pull in” more proofs until eventually there are so many proofs that one has decidability and a “proof event horizon” is formed.</p>\n<p>In a sense this implies that the long-term future of mathematics is strangely similar to the long-term future of our physical universe. In our physical universe, we expect that while the expansion of space may continue, many parts of the universe will form black holes and essentially be “closed off”. (At least ignoring expansion in branchial space, and quantum effects in general.)</p>\n<p>The analog of this in mathematics is that while there can be continued overall expansion in metamathematical space, more and more parts of it will “burn out” because they’ve become decidable. In other words, as more work and more proofs get done in a particular area, that area will eventually be “finished”—and there will be no more “open-ended” questions associated with it.</p>\n<p>In physics there’s sometimes discussion of white holes, which are imagined to effectively be time-reversed black holes, spewing out all possible material that could be captured in a black hole. In metamathematics, a white hole is like a statement that is false and therefore “leads to an explosion”. The presence of such an object in metamathematical space will in effect cause observers to be shredded—making it inconsistent with the coherent construction of higher-level mathematics. </p>\n<p>We’ve talked at some length about the “gravitational” structure of metamathematical space. But what about seemingly simpler things like special relativity? In physics, there’s a notion of basic, flat spacetime, for which it’s easy to construct families of reference frames, and in which parallel trajectories stay parallel. In metamathematics, the analog is presumably metamathematical space in which “parallel proof geodesics” remain “parallel”—so that in effect one can continue “making progress in mathematics” by just “keeping on doing what you’ve been doing”.</p>\n<p>And somehow relativistic invariance is associated with the idea that there are many ways to do math, but in the end they’re all able to reach the same conclusions. Ultimately this is something one expects as a consequence of fundamental features of the ruliad—and the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/multiway-systems-in-the-space-of-all-possible-rules/#p-474' target=_blank rel=noopener>inevitability of causal invariance</a> in it resulting from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. It’s also something that might seem quite familiar from practical mathematics and, say, from the ability to do derivations using different methods—like from either geometry or algebra—and yet still end up with the same conclusions. </p>\n<p>So if there’s an analog of relativistic invariance, what about analogs of phenomena like time dilation? In our Physics Project <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/motion-and-special-relativity/' target=_blank rel=noopener>time dilation has a rather direct interpretation</a>. To “progress in time” takes a certain amount of computational work. But motion in effect also takes a certain amount of computational work—in essence to continually recreate versions of something in different places. But from the ruliad on up there is ultimately only a certain amount of computational work that can be done—and if computational work is being “used up” on motion, there is less available to devote to progress in time, and so time will effectively run more slowly, leading to the experience of time dilation.</p>\n<p>So what is the metamathematical analog of this? Presumably it’s that when you do derivations in math you can either stay in one area and directly make progress in that area, or you can “base yourself in some other area” and make progress only by continually translating back and forth. But ultimately that translation process will take computational work, and so will slow down your progress—leading to an analog of time dilation. </p>\n<p>In physics, the speed of light defines the maximum amount of motion in space that can occur in a certain amount of time. In metamathematics, the analog is that there’s a maximum “translation distance” in metamathematical space that can be “bridged” with a certain amount of derivation. In physics we’re used to measuring spatial distance in meters—and time in seconds. In metamathematics we don’t yet have familiar units in which to measure, say, distance between mathematical concepts—or, for that matter, “amount of derivation” being done. But with the empirical metamathematics we’ll discuss in the next section we actually have the beginnings of a way to define such things, and to use what’s been achieved in the history of human mathematics to at least imagine “empirically measuring” what we might call “maximum metamathematical speed”.</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that we are only at the very beginning of exploring things like the analogs of relativity in metamathematics. One important piece of formal structure that we haven’t really discussed here is causal dependence, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-graph-of-causal-relationships'>causal graphs</a>. We’ve talked at length about statements entailing other statements. But we haven’t talked about questions like which part of which statement is needed for some event to occur that will entail some other statement. And—while there’s no fundamental difficulty in doing it—we haven’t concerned ourselves with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#causal-graphs-and-the-physicalization-of-combinators'>constructing causal graphs</a> to represent causal relationships and causal dependencies between events. </p>\n<p>When it comes to physical observers, there is a very direct interpretation of causal graphs that relates to what a physical observer can experience. But for mathematical observers—where the notion of time is less central—it’s less clear just what the interpretation of causal graphs should be. But one certainly expects that they will enter in the construction of any general “observer theory” that characterizes “observers like us” across both physics and mathematics. </p>\n<h2 id='empirical-metamathematics'><span>26 | </span>Empirical Metamathematics</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed the overall structure of metamathematical space, and the general kind of sampling that we humans do of it (as “mathematical observers”) when we do mathematics. But what can we learn from the specifics of human mathematics, and the actual mathematical statements that humans have published over the centuries?</p>\n<p>We might imagine that these statements are just ones that—as “accidents of history”—humans have “happened to find interesting”. But there’s definitely more to it—and potentially what’s there is a rich source of “empirical data” relevant to our physicalized laws of mathematics, and to what amounts to their “experimental validation”.</p>\n<p>The situation with “human settlements” in metamathematical space is in a sense rather similar to the situation with human settlements in physical space. If we look at where humans have chosen to live and build cities, we’ll find a bunch of locations in 3D space. The details of where these are depend on history and many factors. But there’s a clear overarching theme, that’s in a sense a direct reflection of underlying physics: all the locations lie on the more-or-less spherical surface of the Earth.</p>\n<p>It’s not so straightforward to see what’s going on in the metamathematical case, not least because any notion of coordinatization seems to be much more complicated for metamathematical space than for physical space. But we can still begin by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>doing “empirical metamathematics”</a> and asking questions about for example what amounts to where in metamathematical space we humans have so far established ourselves.

We <a href='#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>discussed above</a> how constructs like numbers and logic can be obtained from a combinator representation of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>We can view the definition dependency graph above as being an empirical example of how somewhat higher-level definitions can be built up. From a computer science perspective, we can think of it as being like a type hierarchy. From a physics perspective, it’s as if we’re starting from atoms, then building up to molecules and beyond. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out, however, that even the top of the definition hierarchy in something like Metamath is still operating very much at an axiomatic kind of level. In the analogy we&#8217;ve been using, it&#8217;s still for the most part “formulating math at the molecular dynamics level” not at the more human “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>We’ve been talking about “the Pythagorean theorem”. But even on the basis of set theory there are many different possible formulations one can give. In Metamath, for example, there is the <a href='https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pythag.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>pythag version</a> (which is what we’ve been using), and there is also a (somewhat more general) <a href='https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pythi.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>pythi version</a>.

But the framework we’ve built here in a sense blends them both into a rather unexpected synthesis.</p>\n<p>The starting point is the idea that mathematics—like physics—is rooted in the ruliad, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>which is a representation of formal necessity</a>. Actual mathematics as we “experience” it is—like physics—based on the particular sampling we make of the ruliad. But then the crucial point is that very basic characteristics of us as “observers” are sufficient to constrain that experience to be our general mathematics—or our physics.</p>\n<p>At some level we can say that “mathematics is always there”—because every aspect of it is ultimately encoded in the ruliad. But in another sense we can say that the mathematics we have is all “up to us”—because it’s based on how we sample the ruliad. But the point is that that sampling is not somehow “arbitrary”: if we’re talking about mathematics for us humans then it’s us ultimately doing the sampling, and the sampling is inevitably constrained by general features of our nature.</p>\n<p>A major discovery from our Physics Project is that it doesn’t take much in the way of constraints on the observer to deeply constrain the laws of physics they will perceive. And similarly we posit here that for “observers like us” there will inevitably be general (“physicalized”) laws of mathematics, that make mathematics inevitably have the general kinds of characteristics we perceive it to have (such as the possibility of doing mathematics at a high level, without always having to drop down to an “atomic” level).</p>\n<p>Particularly over the past century there’s been the idea that mathematics can be specified in terms of axiom systems, and that these axiom systems can somehow be “invented at will”. But our framework does two things. First, it says that “far below” axiom systems is the raw ruliad, which in a sense represents all possible axiom systems. And second, it says that whatever axiom systems we perceive to be “operating” will be ones that we as observers can pick out from the underlying structure of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>At a formal level we can “invent” an arbitrary axiom system (and it’ll be somewhere in the ruliad), but only certain axiom systems will be ones that describe what we as “mathematical observers” can perceive. In a physics setting we might construct some formal physical theory that talks about detailed patterns in the atoms of space (or molecules in a gas), but the kind of “coarse-grained” observations that we can make won’t capture these. Put another way, observers like us can perceive certain kinds of things, and can describe things in terms of these perceptions. But with the wrong kind of theory—or “axioms”—these descriptions won’t be sufficient—and only an observer who’s “shredded” down to a more “atomic” level will be able to track what’s going on.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of different possible math—and physics—in the ruliad. But observers like us can only “access” a certain type. Some putative alien not like us might access a different type—and might end up with both a different math and a different physics. Deep underneath they—like us—would be talking about the ruliad. But they’d be taking different samples of it, and describing different aspects of it.</p>\n<p>For much of the history of mathematics there was a close alignment between the mathematics that was done and what we perceive in the world. For example, Euclidean geometry—with its whole axiomatic structure—was originally conceived just as an idealization of geometrical things that we observe about the world. But by the late 1800s the idea had emerged that one could create “disembodied” axiomatic systems with no particular grounding in our experience in the world. </p>\n<p>And, yes, there are many possible <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p804--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>disembodied axiom systems that one can set up</a>. And in doing <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a> and generally <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>exploring the computational universe</a> it’s interesting to investigate what they do. But the point is that this is something quite different from mathematics as mathematics is normally conceived. Because in a sense mathematics—like physics—is a “more human” activity that’s based on what “observers like us” make of the raw formal structure that is ultimately embodied in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>When it comes to physics there are, it seems, two crucial features of “observers like us”. First, that we’re computationally bounded. And second, that we have the perception that we’re persistent—and have a definite and continuous thread of experience. At the level of atoms of space, we’re in a sense constantly being “remade”. But we nevertheless perceive it as always being the “same us”.</p>\n<p>This single seemingly simple assumption <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>has far-reaching consequences</a>. For example, it leads us to experience a single thread of time. And from the notion that we maintain a continuity of experience from every successive moment to the next we are inexorably led to the idea of a perceived continuum—not only in time, but also for motion and in space. And when combined with intrinsic features of the ruliad and of multicomputation in general, what comes out in the end is a surprisingly precise description of how we’ll perceive our universe to operate—that seems to correspond exactly with known core laws of physics.</p>\n<p>What does that kind of thinking tell us about mathematics? The basic point is that—since in the end both relate to humans—there is necessarily a close correspondence between physical and mathematical observers. Both are computationally bounded. And the assumption of persistence in time for physical observers becomes for mathematical observers the concept of maintaining coherence as more statements are accumulated. And when combined with intrinsic features of the ruliad and multicomputation this then turns out to imply the kind of physicalized laws of mathematics that we’ve discussed.</p>\n<p>In a formal axiomatic view of mathematics one just imagines that one invents axioms and sees their consequences. But what we’re describing here is a view of mathematics that is ultimately just about the ways that we as mathematical observers sample and experience the ruliad. And if we use axiom systems it has to be as a kind of “intermediate language” that helps us make a slightly higher-level description of some corner of the raw ruliad. But actual “human-level” mathematics—like human-level physics—operates at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Our everyday experience of the physical world gives us the impression that we have a kind of “direct access” to many foundational features of physics, like the existence of space and the phenomenon of motion. But our Physics Project implies that these are not concepts that are in any sense “already there”; they are just things that emerge from the raw ruliad when you “parse” it in the kinds of ways observers like us do. </p>\n<p>In mathematics it’s less obvious (at least to all but perhaps experienced pure mathematicians) that there’s “direct access” to anything. But in our view of mathematics here, it’s ultimately just like physics—and ultimately also rooted in the ruliad, but sampled not by physical observers but by mathematical ones. </p>\n<p>So from this point view there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>just as much that&#8217;s “real” underneath mathematics as there is underneath physics</a>. The mathematics is sampled slightly differently (though very similarly)—but we should not in any sense consider it “fundamentally more abstract”. </p>\n<p>When we think of ourselves as entities within the ruliad, we can build up what we might consider a “fully abstract” description of how we get our “experience” of physics. And we can basically do the same thing for mathematics. So if we take the commonsense point of view that physics fundamentally exists “for real”, we’re <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>forced into the same point of view for mathematics</a>. In other words, if we say that the physical universe exists, so must we also say that in some fundamental sense, mathematics also exists.</p>\n<p>It’s not something we as humans “just make”, but it is something that is made through our particular way of observing the ruliad, that is ultimately defined by our particular characteristics as observers, with our particular core assumptions about the world, our particular kinds of sensory experience, and so on.</p>\n<p>So what can we say in the end about whether mathematics is “invented” or “discovered”? It is neither. Its underpinnings are the ruliad, whose structure is a matter of formal necessity. But its perceived form for us is determined by our intrinsic characteristics as observers. We neither get to “arbitrarily invent” what’s underneath, nor do we get to “arbitrarily discover” what’s already there. The mathematics we see is the result of a combination of formal necessity in the underlying ruliad, and the particular forms of perception that we—as entities like us—have. Putative aliens could have quite different mathematics, but not because the underlying ruliad is any different for them, but because their forms of perception might be different. And it’s the same with physics: even though they “live in the same physical universe” their perception of the laws of physics could be quite different.</p>\n<h2 id='what-axioms-can-there-be-for-human-mathematics'><span>28 | </span>What Axioms Can There Be for Human Mathematics?</h2>\n<p>When they were first developed in antiquity the axioms of Euclidean geometry were presumably intended basically as a kind of “tightening” of our everyday impressions of geometry—that would aid in being able to deduce what was true in geometry. But by the mid-1800s—between non-Euclidean geometry, group theory, Boolean algebra and quaternions—it had become clear that there was a range of abstract axiom systems one could in principle consider. And by the time of Hilbert’s program around 1900 the pure process of deduction was in effect being viewed as an end in itself—and indeed the core of mathematics—with axiom systems being seen as “starter material” pretty much just “determined by convention”.</p>\n<p>In practice even today very few different axiom systems are ever commonly used—and indeed in <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> I was able to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p773--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>list essentially all of them comfortably on a couple of pages</a>. But why these axiom systems and not others? Despite the idea that axiom systems could ultimately be arbitrary, the concept was still that in studying some particular area of mathematics one should basically have an axiom system that would provide a “tight specification” of whatever mathematical object or structure one was trying to talk about. And so, for example, the Peano axioms are what became used for talking about arithmetic-style operations on integers.</p>\n<p>In 1931, however, Gödel’s theorem showed that actually these axioms weren’t strong enough to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p800--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>constrain one to be talking only about integers</a>: there were also other possible models of the axiom system, involving all sorts of exotic “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--non-standard-arithmetic/'>non-standard arithmetic</a>”. (And moreover, there was no finite way to “patch” this issue.) In other words, even though the Peano axioms had been invented—like Euclid’s axioms for geometry—as a way to describe a definite “intuitive” mathematical thing (in this case, integers) their formal axiomatic structure “had a life of its own” that extended (in some sense, infinitely) beyond its original intended purpose.</p>\n<p>Both geometry and arithmetic in a sense had foundations in everyday experience. But for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>set theory dealing with infinite sets</a> there was never an obvious intuitive base rooted in everyday experience. Some extrapolations from finite sets were clear. But in covering infinite sets various axioms (like the Axiom of Choice) were gradually added to capture what seemed like “reasonable” mathematical assertions.</p>\n<p>But one example whose status for a long time wasn’t clear was the Continuum Hypothesis—which asserts that the “next distinct possible cardinality” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img1A.png\" width= '17' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> after the cardinality <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img2A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> of the integers is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img3A.png\" width= '25' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>: the cardinality of real numbers (i.e. of “the continuum”). Was this something that followed from previously accepted axioms of set theory? And if it was added, would it even be consistent with them? In the early 1960s it was established that actually the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of the other axioms.</p>\n<p>With the axiomatic view of the foundations of mathematics that’s been popular for the past century or so it seems as if one could, for example, just choose at will whether to include the Continuum Hypothesis (or its negation) as an axiom in set theory. But with the approach to the foundations of mathematics that we’ve developed here, this is no longer so clear.</p>\n<p>Recall that in our approach, everything is ultimately rooted in the ruliad—with whatever mathematics observers like us “experience” just being the result of the particular sampling we do of the ruliad. And in this picture, axiom systems are a particular representation of fairly low-level features of the sampling we do of the raw ruliad. </p>\n<p>If we could do any kind of sampling we want of the ruliad, then we’d presumably be able to get all possible axiom systems—as intermediate-level “waypoints” representing different kinds of slices of the ruliad. But in fact by our nature we are observers capable of only certain kinds of sampling of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>We could imagine “alien observers” not like us who could for example make whatever choice they want about the Continuum Hypothesis. But given our general characteristics as observers, we may be forced into a particular choice. Operationally, as we’ve discussed above, the wrong choice could, for example, be incompatible with an observer who “maintains coherence” in metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a particular axiom stated in standard symbolic form. “Underneath” this axiom there will typically be at the level of the raw ruliad a huge cloud of possible configurations of emes that can represent the axiom. But an “observer like us” can only deal with a coarse-grained version in which all these different configurations are somehow considered equivalent. And if the entailments from “nearby configurations” remain nearby, then everything will work out, and the observer can maintain a coherent view of what’s going, for example just in terms of symbolic statements about axioms.</p>\n<p>But if instead different entailments of raw configurations of emes lead to very different places, the observer will in effect be “shredded”—and instead of having definite coherent “single-minded” things to say about what happens, they’ll have to separate everything into all the different cases for different configurations of emes. Or, as we’ve said it before, the observer will inevitably end up getting “shredded”—and not be able to come up with definite mathematical conclusions.</p>\n<p>So what specifically can we say about the Continuum Hypothesis? It’s not clear. But conceivably we can start by thinking of <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img4A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> as characterizing the “base cardinality” of the ruliad, while <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img5A.png\" width= '25' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> characterizes the base cardinality of a first-level <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#whats-beyond-the-ruliad?'>hyperruliad</a> that could for example be based on Turing machines with oracles for their halting problems. And it could be that for us to conclude that the Continuum Hypothesis is false, we’d have to somehow be straddling the ruliad and the hyperruliad, which would be inconsistent with us maintaining a coherent view of mathematics. In other words, the Continuum Hypothesis might somehow be equivalent to what we’ve argued before is in a sense the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#is-this-the-only-universe?'>most fundamental “contingent fact”</a>—that just as we live in a particular location in physical space—so also we live in the ruliad and not the hyperruliad. </p>\n<p>We might have thought that whatever we might see—or construct—in mathematics would in effect be “entirely abstract” and independent of anything about physics, or our experience in the physical world. But particularly insofar as we’re thinking about mathematics as done by humans we’re dealing with “mathematical observers” that are “made of the same stuff” as physical observers. And this means that whatever general constraints or features exist for physical observers we can expect these to carry over to mathematical observers—so it’s no coincidence that both physical and mathematical observers have the same core characteristics, of computational boundedness and “assumption of coherence”. </p>\n<p>And what this means is that there’ll be a fundamental correlation between things familiar from our experience in the physical world and what shows up in our mathematics. We might have thought that the fact that Euclid’s original axioms were based on our human perceptions of physical space would be a sign that in some “overall picture” of mathematics they should be considered arbitrary and not in any way central. But the point is that in fact our notions of space are central to our characteristics as observers. And so it’s inevitable that “physical-experience-informed” axioms like those for Euclidean geometry will be what appear in mathematics for “observers like us”. </p>\n<h2 id='counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'><span>29 | </span>Counting the Emes of Mathematics and Physics</h2>\n<p>How does the “size of mathematics” compare to the size of our physical universe? In the past this might have seemed like an absurd question, that tries to compare something abstract and arbitrary with something real and physical. But with the idea that both mathematics and physics as we experience them emerge from our sampling of the ruliad, it begins to seem less absurd.</p>\n<p>At the lowest level the ruliad can be thought of as being made up of atoms of existence that we call emes. As physical observers we interpret these emes as atoms of space, or in effect the ultimate raw material of the physical universe. And as mathematical observers we interpret them as the ultimate elements from which the constructs of mathematics are built. </p>\n<p>As the entangled limit of all possible computations, the whole ruliad is infinite. But we as physical or mathematical observers sample only limited parts of it. And that means we can meaningfully ask questions like how the number of emes in these parts compare—or, in effect, how big is physics as we experience it compared to mathematics.</p>\n<p>In some ways an eme is like a bit. But the concept of emes is that they’re “actual atoms of existence”—from which “actual stuff” like the physical universe and its history are made—rather than just “static informational representations” of it. As soon as we imagine that everything is ultimately computational we are immediately led to start thinking of representing it in terms of bits. But the ruliad is not just a representation. It’s in some way something lower level. It’s the “actual stuff” that everything is made of. And what defines our particular experience of physics or of mathematics is the particular samples we as observers take of what’s in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>So the question is now how many emes there are in those samples. Or, more specifically, how many emes “matter to us” in building up our experience. </p>\n<p>Let’s return to an analogy we’ve used several times before: a gas made of molecules. In the volume of a room there might be <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img1A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> individual molecules, each on average colliding every <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img2A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> seconds. So that means that our “experience of the room” over the course of a minute or so might sample <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img3A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> collisions. Or, in terms closer to our Physics Project, we might say that there are perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img4A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> “collision events” in the causal graph that defines what we experience.</p>\n<p>But these “collision events” aren’t something fundamental; they have what amounts to “internal structure” with many associated parameters about location, time, molecular configuration, etc. </p>\n<p>Our Physics Project, however, suggests that—far below for example our usual notions of space and time—we can in fact have a truly fundamental definition of what’s happening in the universe, ultimately in terms of emes. We don’t yet know the “physical scale” for this—and in the end we presumably need experiments to determine that. But <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/units-and-scales/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rather rickety estimates</a> based on a variety of assumptions suggest that the elementary length might be around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img5A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> meters, with the elementary time being around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img6A.png\" width= '44' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> seconds.</p>\n<p>And with these estimates we might conclude that our “experience of a room for a minute” would involve sampling perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img7A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> update events, that create about this number of atoms of space.</p>\n<p>But it’s immediately clear that this is in a sense a gross underestimate of the total number of emes that we’re sampling. And the reason is that we’re not accounting for quantum mechanics, and for the multiway nature of the evolution of the universe. We’ve so far only considered one “thread of time” at one “position in branchial space”. But in fact there are many threads of time, constantly branching and merging. So how many of these do we experience?</p>\n<p>In effect that depends on our size in branchial space. In physical space “human scale” is of order a meter—or perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img8A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> elementary lengths. But how big is it in branchial space? </p>\n<p>The fact that we’re so large compared to the elementary length is the reason that we consistently experience space as something continuous. And the analog in branchial space is that if we’re big compared to the “elementary branchial distance between branches” then we won’t experience the different individual histories of these branches, but only an aggregate “objective reality” in which we conflate together what happens on all the branches. Or, put another way, being large in branchial space is what makes us experience classical physics rather than quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>Our estimates for branchial space are even more rickety than for physical space. But conceivably there are on the order of <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img9A.png\" width= '36' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> “instantaneous parallel threads of time” in the universe, and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img10A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> encompassed by our instantaneous experience—implying that in our minute-long experience we might sample a total of on the order of close to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img11A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes.</p>\n<p>But even this is a vast underestimate. Yes, it tries to account for our extent in physical space and in branchial space. But then <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>there&#8217;s also rulial space</a>—which in effect is what “fills out” the whole ruliad. So how big are we in that space? In essence that’s like asking how many different possible sequences of rules there are that are consistent with our experience. </p>\n<p>The total conceivable number of sequences associated with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img12A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes is roughly the number of possible hypergraphs with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img13A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> nodes—or around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img14A.png\" width= '78' height='22' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>. But the actual number consistent with our experience is smaller, in particular as reflected by the fact that we attribute specific laws to our universe. But when we say “specific laws” we have to recognize that there is a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#living-in-rulial-space'>finiteness to our efforts at inductive inference</a> which inevitably makes these laws at least somewhat uncertain to us. And in a sense that uncertainty is what represents our “extent in rulial space”. </p>\n<p>But if we want to count the emes that we “absorb” as physical observers, it’s still going to be a huge number. Perhaps the base may be lower—say <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img15A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>—but there’s still a vast exponent, suggesting that if we include our extent in rulial space, we as physical observers may experience numbers of emes like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img16A.png\" width= '70' height='22' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>But let’s say we go beyond our “everyday human-scale experience”. For example, let’s ask about “experiencing” our whole universe. In physical space, the volume of our current universe is about <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img17A.png\" width= '30' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than “human scale” (while human scale is perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img18A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than the “scale of the atoms of space”). In branchial space, conceivably our current universe is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img19A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than “human scale”. But these differences absolutely pale in comparison to the sizes associated with rulial space. </p>\n<p>We might try to go beyond “ordinary human experience” and for example measure things using tools from science and technology. And, yes, we could then think about “experiencing” lengths down to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img20A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> meters, or something close to “single threads” of quantum histories. But in the end, it’s still the rulial size that dominates, and that’s where we can expect most of the vast number of emes that form of our experience of the physical universe to come from.</p>\n<p>OK, so what about mathematics? When we think about what we might call human-scale mathematics, and talk about things like the Pythagorean theorem, how many emes are there “underneath”? “Compiling” our theorem down to typical traditional mathematical axioms, we’ve seen that we’ll routinely end up with expressions containing, say, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img21A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> symbolic elements. But what happens if we go “below that”, compiling these symbolic elements—which might include things like variables and operators—into “pure computational elements” that we can think of as emes? We’ve seen a few examples, say with combinators, that suggest that for the traditional axiomatic structures of mathematics, we might need another factor of maybe roughly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img22A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>These are incredibly rough estimates, but perhaps there’s a hint that there’s “further to go” to get from human-scale for a physical observer down to atoms of space that correspond to emes, than there is to get from human-scale for a mathematical observer down to emes.</p>\n<p>Just like in physics, however, this kind of “static drill-down” isn’t the whole story for mathematics. When we talk about something like the Pythagorean theorem, we’re really referring to a whole cloud of “human-equivalent” points in metamathematical space. The total number of “possible points” is basically the size of the entailment cone that contains something like the Pythagorean theorem. The “height” of the entailment cone is related to typical lengths of proofs—which for current human mathematics might be perhaps hundreds of steps. </p>\n<p>And this would lead to overall sizes of <a href='#empirical-metamathematics'>entailment cones</a> of very roughly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img23A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> theorems. But within this “how big” is the cloud of variants corresponding to particular “human-recognized” theorems? Empirical metamathematics could provide additional data on this question. But if we very roughly imagine that half of every proof is “flexible”, we’d end up with things like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img24A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> variants. So if we asked how many emes correspond to the “experience” of the Pythagorean theorem, it might be, say, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img25A.png\" width= '32' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>. </p>\n<p>To give an analogy of “everyday physical experience” we might consider a mathematician thinking about mathematical concepts, and maybe in effect pondering a few tens of theorems per minute—implying according to our extremely rough and speculative estimates that while typical “specific human-scale physics experience” might involve <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img26A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes, specific human-scale mathematics experience might involve <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img27A.png\" width= '32' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes (a number comparable, for example, to the number of physical atoms in our universe). </p>\n<p>What if instead of considering “everyday mathematical experience” we consider <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>all humanly explored mathematics</a>? On the scales we’re describing, the factors are not large. In the history of human mathematics, only a few million theorems have been published. If we think about all the computations that have been done in the service of mathematics, it’s a somewhat larger factor. I suspect <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica'>Mathematica</a> is the dominant contributor here—and we can estimate that the total number of <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language'>Wolfram Language</a> operations corresponding to “human-level mathematics” done so far is perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img28A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>But just like for physics, all these numbers pale in comparison with those introduced by rulial sizes. We’ve talked essentially about a particular path from emes through specific axioms to theorems. But the ruliad in effect contains all possible axiom systems. And if we start thinking about enumerating these—and effectively “populating all of rulial space”—we’ll end up with exponentially more emes. </p>\n<p>But as with the perceived laws of physics, in mathematics as done by humans it’s actually just a narrow slice of rulial space that we’re sampling. It’s like a generalization of the idea that something like arithmetic as we imagine it can be derived from a whole cloud of possible axiom systems. It’s not just one axiom system; but it’s also not all possible axiom systems. </p>\n<p>One can imagine doing some combination of ruliology and empirical metamathematics to get an estimate of “how broad” human-equivalent axiom systems (and their construction from emes) might be. But the answer seems likely to be much smaller than the kinds of sizes we have been estimating for physics.</p>\n<p>It’s important to emphasize that what we’ve discussed here is extremely rough—and speculative. And indeed I view its main value as being to provide an example of how to imagine thinking through things in the context of the ruliad and the framework around it. But on the basis of what we’ve discussed, we might make the very tentative conclusion that “human-experienced physics” is bigger than “human-experienced mathematics”. Both involve vast numbers of emes. But physics seems to involve a lot more. In a sense—even with all its abstraction—the suspicion is that there’s “less ultimately in mathematics” as far as we’re concerned than there is in physics. Though by any ordinary human standards, mathematics still involves absolutely vast numbers of emes. </p>\n<h2 id='some-historical-and-philosophical-background'><span>30 | </span>Some Historical (and Philosophical) Background</h2>\n<p>The human activity that we now call “mathematics” can presumably trace its origins into prehistory. What might have started as “a single goat”, “a pair of goats”, etc. became a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/how-inevitable-is-the-concept-of-numbers/'>story of abstract numbers</a> that could be indicated purely by things like tally marks. In Babylonian times the practicalities of a city-based society led to all sorts of calculations involving arithmetic and geometry—and basically everything we now call “mathematics” <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p792--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>can ultimately be thought of as a generalization of these ideas</a>.</p>\n<p>The tradition of philosophy that emerged in Greek times saw mathematics as a kind of reasoning. But while much of arithmetic (apart from issues of infinity and infinitesimals) could be thought of in explicit calculational ways, precise geometry immediately required an idealization—specifically the concept of a point having no extent, or equivalently, the continuity of space. And in an effort to reason on top of this idealization, there emerged the idea of defining axioms and making abstract deductions from them.</p>\n<p>But what kind of a thing actually was mathematics? Plato talked about things we sense in the external world, and things we conceptualize in our internal thoughts. But he considered mathematics to be at its core an example of a third kind of thing: something from an abstract world of ideal forms. And with our current thinking, there is an immediate resonance between this concept of ideal forms and the concept of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>But for most of the past two millennia of the actual development of mathematics, questions about what it ultimately was lay in the background. An important step was taken in the late 1600s when Newton and others “mathematicized” mechanics, at first presenting what they did in the form of axioms similar to Euclid’s. Through the 1700s mathematics as a practical field was viewed as some kind of precise idealization of features of the world—though with an increasingly elaborate tower of formal derivations constructed in it. Philosophy, meanwhile, typically viewed mathematics—like logic—mostly as an example of a system in which there was a formal process of derivation with a “necessary” structure not requiring reference to the real world.</p>\n<p>But in the first half of the 1800s there arose several examples of systems where axioms—while inspired by features of the world—ultimately seemed to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--history-of-concept-of-mathematics/'>“just invented” (e.g. group theory, curved space, quaternions, Boolean algebra, &#8230;)</a>. A push towards increasing rigor (especially for calculus and the nature of real numbers) led to more focus on axiomatization and formalization—which was still further emphasized by the appearance of a few non-constructive “purely formal” proofs.</p>\n<p>But if mathematics was to be formalized, what should its underlying primitives be? One obvious choice seemed to be logic, which had originally been developed by Aristotle as a kind of catalog of human arguments, but two thousand years later felt basic and inevitable. And so it was that Frege, followed by Whitehead and Russell, tried to start “constructing mathematics” from “pure logic” (along with set theory). Logic was in a sense a rather low-level “machine code”, and it took hundreds of pages of unreadable (if impressive-looking) “code” for Whitehead and Russell, in their <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2010/11/100-years-since-principia-mathematica/'>1910 <em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>, to get to 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. </p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.org/details/principiamathema01anwh/page/366/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/32-principia-mathematica-1910A.png' alt='Pages 366–367' title='Pages 366–367' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, starting around 1900, Hilbert took a slightly different path, essentially representing everything with what we would now call symbolic expressions, and setting up axioms as relations between these. But what axioms should be used? Hilbert seemed to feel that the core of mathematics lay not in any “external meaning” but in the pure formal structure built up from whatever axioms were used. And he imagined that somehow all the truths of mathematics could be “mechanically derived” from axioms, a bit, as he said in a certain resonance with our current views, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/where-did-combinators-come-from-hunting-the-story-of-moses-schonfinkel/#gottingen,-center-of-the-mathematical-universe'>like the “great calculating machine, Nature”</a> does it for physics. </p>\n<p>Not all mathematicians, however, bought into this “formalist” view of what mathematics is. And in 1931 Gödel managed to prove from inside the formal axiom system traditionally used for arithmetic that this system had a fundamental incompleteness that prevented it from ever having anything to say about certain mathematical statements. But Gödel seems to have maintained a more Platonic belief about mathematics: that even though the axiomatic method falls short, the truths of mathematics are in some sense still “all there”, and it’s potentially possible for the human mind to have “direct access” to them. And while this is not quite the same as our picture of the mathematical observer accessing the ruliad, there’s again some definite resonance here.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so how has mathematics actually conducted itself over the past century? Typically there’s at least lip service paid to the idea that there are “axioms underneath”—usually assumed to be those from set theory. There’s been significant emphasis placed on the idea of formal deduction and proof—but not so much in terms of formally building up from axioms as in terms of giving narrative expositions that help humans understand why some theorem might follow from other things they know.</p>\n<p>There’s been a field of “mathematical logic” concerned with using mathematics-like methods to explore mathematics-like aspects of formal axiomatic systems. But (at least until very recently) there’s been rather little interaction between this and the “mainstream” study of mathematics. And for example phenomena like undecidability that are central to mathematical logic have seemed rather remote from typical pure mathematics—even though many actual long-unsolved problems in mathematics do seem likely to run into it.</p>\n<p>But even if formal axiomatization may have been something of a sideshow for mathematics, its ideas have brought us what is without much doubt the single most important intellectual breakthrough of the twentieth century: the abstract concept of computation. And what’s now become clear is that computation is in some fundamental sense much more general than mathematics.</p>\n<p>At a philosophical level one can view the ruliad as containing all computation. But mathematics (at least as it’s done by humans) is defined by what a “mathematical observer like us” samples and perceives in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>The most common “core workflow” for mathematicians doing pure mathematics is first to imagine what might be true (usually through a process of intuition that feels a bit like making “direct access to the truths of mathematics”)—and then to “work backwards” to try to construct a proof. As a practical matter, though, the vast majority of “mathematics done in the world” doesn’t follow this workflow, and instead just “runs forward”—doing computation. And there’s no reason for at least the innards of that computation to have any “humanized character” to it; it can just involve the raw processes of computation.</p>\n<p>But the traditional pure mathematics workflow in effect depends on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>using “human-level” steps</a>. Or if, as we described earlier, we think of low-level axiomatic operations as being like molecular dynamics, then it involves operating at a “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>A century ago efforts to “globally understand mathematics” centered on trying to find common axiomatic foundations for everything. But as different areas of mathematics were explored (and particularly ones like algebraic topology that cut across existing disciplines) it began to seem as if there might also be “top-down” commonalities in mathematics, in effect directly at the “fluid dynamics” level. And within the last few decades, it’s become increasingly common to use ideas from category theory as a general framework for thinking about mathematics at a high level.</p>\n<p>But there’s also been an effort to progressively build up—as an abstract matter—formal “higher category theory”. A notable feature of this has been the appearance of connections to both geometry and mathematical logic—and for us a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#the-view-from-mathematics'>connection to the ruliad</a> and its features. </p>\n<p>The success of category theory has led in the past decade or so to interest in other high-level structural approaches to mathematics. A notable example is homotopy type theory. The basic concept is to characterize mathematical objects not by using axioms to describe properties they should have, but instead to use “types” to say “what the objects are” (for example, “mapping from reals to integers”). Such type theory has the feature that it tends to look much more “immediately computational” than traditional mathematical structures and notation—as well as making explicit proofs and other metamathematical concepts. And in fact questions about types and their equivalences wind up <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#the-view-from-mathematics'>being very much like</a> the questions we’ve discussed for the multiway systems we’re using as metamodels for mathematics.</p>\n<p>Homotopy type theory can itself be set up as a formal axiomatic system—but with axioms that include what amount to metamathematical statements. A key example is the univalence axiom which essentially states that things that are equivalent can be treated as the same. And now from our point of view here we can see this being essentially a statement of metamathematical coarse graining—and a piece of defining what should be considered “mathematics” on the basis of properties assumed for a mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>When Plato introduced ideal forms and their distinction from the external and internal world the understanding of even the fundamental concept of computation—let alone <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputation</a> and the ruliad—was still more than two millennia in the future. But now our picture is that everything can in a sense be viewed as part of the world of ideal forms that is the ruliad—and that not only mathematics but also physical reality are in effect just manifestations of these ideal forms.</p>\n<p>But a crucial aspect is how we sample the “ideal forms” of the ruliad. And this is where the “contingent facts” about us as human “observers” enter. The formal axiomatic view of mathematics can be viewed as providing one kind of low-level description of the ruliad. But the point is that this description isn’t aligned with what observers like us perceive—or with what we will successfully be able to view as human-level mathematics. </p>\n<p>A century ago there was a movement to take mathematics (as well, as it happens, as other fields) beyond its origins in what amount to human perceptions of the world. But what we now see is that while there is an underlying “world of ideal forms” embodied in the ruliad that has nothing to do with us humans, mathematics as we humans do it must be associated with the particular sampling we make of that underlying structure.</p>\n<p>And it’s not as if we get to pick that sampling “at will”; the sampling we do is the result of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>fundamental features of us as humans</a>. And an important point is that those fundamental features determine our characteristics both as mathematical observers and as physical observers. And this fact leads to a deep connection between our experience of physics and our definition of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Mathematics historically began as a formal idealization of our human perception of the physical world. Along the way, though, it began to think of itself as a more purely abstract pursuit, separated from both human perception and the physical world. But now, with the general idea of computation, and more specifically with the concept of the ruliad, we can in a sense see what the limit of such abstraction would be. And interesting though it is, what we’re now discovering is that it’s not the thing we call mathematics. And instead, what we call mathematics is something that is subtly but deeply determined by general features of human perception—in fact, essentially the same features that also determine our perception of the physical world.</p>\n<p>The intellectual foundations and justification are different now. But in a sense our view of mathematics has come full circle. And we can now see that mathematics is in fact deeply connected to the physical world and our particular perception of it. And we as humans can do what we call mathematics for basically the same reason that we as humans manage to parse the physical world to the point where we can do science about it.</p>\n<h2 id='implications-for-the-future-of-mathematics'><span>31 | </span>Implications for the Future of Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Having talked a bit about historical context let’s now talk about what the things we’ve discussed here mean for the future of mathematics—both in theory and in practice. </p>\n<p>At a theoretical level we’ve characterized the story of mathematics as being the story of a particular way of exploring the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a>. And from this we might think that in some sense the ultimate limit of mathematics would be to just deal with the ruliad as a whole. But observers like us—at least doing mathematics the way we normally do it—simply can’t do that. And in fact, with the limitations we have as mathematical observers we can inevitably sample only tiny slices of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But as we’ve discussed, it is exactly this that leads us to experience the kinds of “general laws of mathematics” that we’ve talked about. And it is from these laws that we get a picture of the “large-scale structure of mathematics”—that turns out to be in many ways similar to the picture of the large-scale structure of our physical universe that we get from physics.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, what corresponds to the coherent structure of physical space is the possibility of doing mathematics in terms of high-level concepts—without always having to drop down to the “atomic” level. Effective uniformity of metamathematical space then leads to the idea of “pure metamathematical motion”, and in effect the possibility of translating at a high level between different areas of mathematics. And what this suggests is that in some sense “all high-level areas of mathematics” should ultimately be connected by “high-level dualities”—some of which have already been seen, but many of which remain to be discovered.</p>\n<p>Thinking about metamathematics in physicalized terms also suggests another phenomenon: essentially an <a href='#gravitational-and-relativistic-effects-in-metamathematics'>analog of gravity for metamathematics</a>. As we discussed earlier, in direct analogy to the way that &#8220;larger densities of activity&#8221; in the spatial hypergraph for physics lead to a deflection in geodesic paths in physical space, so also larger &#8220;entailment density&#8221; in metamathematical space will lead to deflection in geodesic paths in metamathematical space. And when the entailment density gets sufficiently high, it presumably becomes inevitable that these paths will all converge, leading to what one might think of as a &#8220;metamathematical singularity&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the spacetime case, a typical analog would be a place where all geodesics have finite length, or in effect “time stops”. In our view of metamathematics, it corresponds to a situation where “all proofs are finite”—or, in other words, where everything is decidable, and there is no more “fundamental difficulty” left. </p>\n<p>Absent other effects we might imagine that in the physical universe the effects of gravity would eventually lead everything to collapse into black holes. And the analog in metamathematics would be that everything in mathematics would “collapse” into decidable theories. But among the effects not accounted for is continued expansion—or in effect the creation of new physical or metamathematical space, formed in a sense by underlying raw computational processes.</p>\n<p>What will observers like us make of this, though? In statistical mechanics an observer who does coarse graining might perceive the “heat death of the universe”. But at a molecular level there is all sorts of detailed motion that reflects a continued irreducible process of computation. And inevitably there will be an infinite collection of possible “slices of reducibility” to be found in this—just not necessarily ones that align with any of our current capabilities as observers. </p>\n<p>What does this mean for mathematics? Conceivably it might suggest that there’s only so much that can fundamentally be discovered in “high-level mathematics” without in effect “expanding our scope as observers”—or in essence changing our definition of what it is we humans mean by doing mathematics. </p>\n<p>But underneath all this is still raw computation—and the ruliad. And this we know goes on forever, in effect continually generating “irreducible surprises”. But how should we study “raw computation”?</p>\n<p>In essence we want to do unfettered exploration of the computational universe, of the kind I did in <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and that we now call the science of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>. It’s something we can view as more abstract and more fundamental than mathematics—and indeed, as we’ve argued, it’s for example what’s underneath not only mathematics but also physics.</p>\n<p>Ruliology is a rich intellectual activity, important for example as a source of models for many processes in nature and elsewhere. But it’s one where computational irreducibility and undecidability are seen at almost every turn—and it’s not one where we can readily expect “general laws” accessible to observers like us, of the kind we’ve seen in physics, and now see in mathematics.</p>\n<p>We’ve argued that with its foundation in the ruliad mathematics is ultimately based on structures lower level than axiom systems. But given their familiarity from the history of mathematics, it’s convenient to use axiom systems—as we have done here—as a kind of “intermediate-scale metamodel” for mathematics.</p>\n<p>But what is the “workflow” for using axiom systems? One possibility in effect inspired by ruliology is just to systematically construct the entailment cone for an axiom system, progressively generating all possible theorems that the axiom system implies. But while doing this is of great theoretical interest, it typically isn’t something that will in practice reach much in the way of (currently) familiar mathematical results.</p>\n<p>But let’s say one’s thinking about a particular result. A proof of this would correspond to a path within the entailment cone. And the idea of <a href='#relations-to-automated-theorem-proving'>automated theorem proving</a> is to systematically find such a path—which, with a variety of tricks, can usually be done vastly more efficiently than just by enumerating everything in the entailment cone. In practice, though, despite half a century of history, automated theorem proving has seen very little use in mainstream mathematics. Of course it doesn’t help that in typical mathematical work a proof is seen as part of the high-level exposition of ideas—but automated proofs tend to operate at the level of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>“axiomatic machine code”</a> without any connection to human-level narrative.</p>\n<p>But if one doesn’t already know the result one’s trying to prove? Part of the intuition that comes from <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is that there can be “interesting results” that are still simple enough that they can conceivably be found by some kind of explicit search—and then verified by automated theorem proving. But so far as I know, only one significant unexpected result has so far ever been found in this way with automated theorem proving: <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>my 2000 result on the simplest axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>.</p>\n<p>And the fact is that when it comes to using computers for mathematics, the overwhelming fraction of the time they’re used not to construct proofs, but instead to do “forward computations” and “get results” (yes, often with <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a>). Of course, within those forward computations, there are many operations—like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Reduce.html'>Reduce</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SatisfiableQ.html'>SatisfiableQ</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PrimeQ.html'>PrimeQ</a></tt>, etc.—that essentially work by internally finding proofs, but their output is “just results” not “why-it’s-true explanations”. (<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>—as its name suggests—is a case where an actual proof is generated.)</p>\n<p>Whether one’s thinking in terms of axioms and proofs, or just in terms of “getting results”, one’s ultimately always dealing with computation. But the key question is how that computation is “packaged”. Is one dealing with arbitrary, raw, low-level constructs, or with something higher level and more “humanized”?</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, at the lowest level, everything can be represented in terms of the ruliad. But when we do both mathematics and physics what we’re perceiving is not the raw ruliad, but rather just certain high-level features of it. But how should these be represented? Ultimately we need a language that we humans understand, that captures the particular features of the underlying raw computation that we’re interested in.</p>\n<p>From our computational point of view, mathematical notation can be thought of as a rough attempt at this. But the most complete and systematic effort in this direction is the one I’ve worked towards for the past several decades: what’s now the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>full-scale computational language</a> that is the Wolfram Language (and Mathematica).</p>\n<p>Ultimately the Wolfram Language can represent any computation. But the point is to make it easy to represent the computations that people care about: to capture the high-level constructs (whether they’re polynomials, geometrical objects or chemicals) that are part of modern human thinking. </p>\n<p>The <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>process of language design</a> (on which, yes, I’ve spent immense amounts of time) is a curious mixture of art and science, that requires both drilling down to the essence of things, and creatively devising ways to make those things accessible and cognitively convenient for humans. At some level it’s a bit like deciding on words as they might appear in a human language—but it’s something more structured and demanding.</p>\n<p>And it’s our best way of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>representing “high-level” mathematics</a>: mathematics not at the axiomatic (or below) “machine code” level, but instead at the level human mathematicians typically think about it. </p>\n<p>We’ve definitely not “finished the job”, though. Wolfram Language currently has around 7000 built-in primitive constructs, of which at least a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/#HigherMathematicalComputation'>couple of thousand can be considered “primarily mathematical”</a>. But while the language has long contained constructs for <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AlgebraicNumbers.html'>algebraic numbers</a>, <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/RandomProcesses.html'>random walks</a> and <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/GroupTheory.html'>finite groups</a>, it doesn’t (yet) have built-in constructs for algebraic topology or K-theory. In recent years we’ve been <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2016/12/22/the-semantic-representation-of-pure-mathematics/'>slowly adding more kinds of pure-mathematical constructs</a>—but to reach the frontiers of modern human mathematics might require <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>perhaps a thousand more</a>. And to make them useful all of them will have to be carefully and coherently designed.</p>\n<p>The great power of the Wolfram Language comes not only from being able to represent things computationally, but also being able to compute with things, and get results. And it’s one thing to be able to represent some pure mathematical construct—but quite another to be able to broadly compute with it.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language in a sense emphasizes the “forward computation” workflow. Another workflow that’s achieved some popularity in recent years is the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07758' target=_blank rel=noopener>proof assistant</a> one—in which one defines a result and then as a human one tries to fill in the steps to create a proof of it, with the computer verifying that the steps correctly fit together. If the steps are low level then what one has is something like typical automated theorem proving—though now being attempted with human effort rather than being done automatically. </p>\n<p>In principle one can build up to much higher-level “steps” in a modular way. But now the problem is essentially the same as in computational language design: to create primitives that are both precise enough to be immediately handled computationally, and “cognitively convenient” enough to be usefully understood by humans. And realistically once one’s done the design (which, after decades of <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>working on such things, I can say is hard</a>), there’s likely to be much more “leverage” to be had by letting the computer just do computations than by expending human effort (even with computer assistance) to put together proofs.</p>\n<p>One might think that a proof would be important in being sure one’s got the right answer. But as we’ve discussed, that’s a complicated concept when one’s dealing with human-level mathematics. If we go to a full axiomatic level it’s very typical that there will be all sorts of pedantic conditions involved. Do we have the “right answer” if underneath we assume that 1/0=0? Or does this not matter at the “fluid dynamics” level of human mathematics? </p>\n<p>One of the great things about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a> is that—at least if it’s written well—it provides a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/'>clear and succinct specification of things</a>, just like a good “human proof” is supposed to. But computational language has the great advantage that it can be run to create new results—rather than just being used to check something.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that there’s another potential workflow beyond “compute a result” and “find a proof”. It’s “here’s an object or a set of constraints for creating one; now find interesting facts about this”. Type into <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> something like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sin%5E4%28x%29'>sin^4(x)</a> (and, yes, there’s “natural math understanding” needed to translate something like this to precise Wolfram Language). There’s nothing obvious to “compute” here. But instead what Wolfram|Alpha does is to “say interesting things” about this—like what its maximum or its integral over a period is.</p>\n<p>In principle this is a bit like exploring the entailment cone—but with the crucial additional piece of picking out which entailments will be “interesting to humans”. (And implementationally it’s a very deeply constrained exploration.) </p>\n<p>It’s interesting to compare these various workflows with what one can call <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/'>experimental mathematics</a>. Sometimes this term is basically just applied to studying explicit examples of known mathematical results. But the much more powerful concept is to imagine discovering new mathematical results by “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/03/two-hours-of-experimental-mathematics/'>doing experiments</a>”.</p>\n<p>Usually these experiments are not done at the level of axioms, but rather at a considerably higher level (e.g. with things specified using the primitives of Wolfram Language). But the typical pattern is to enumerate a large number of cases and to see what happens—with the most exciting result being the discovery of some unexpected phenomenon, regularity or irregularity. </p>\n<p>This type of approach is in a sense much more general than mathematics: it can be applied to anything computational, or anything described by rules. And indeed it is the core methodology of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>, and what it does to explore the computational universe—and the ruliad.</p>\n<p>One can think of the typical approach in pure mathematics as representing a gradual expansion of the entailment fabric, with humans checking (perhaps with a computer) statements they consider adding. Experimental mathematics effectively strikes out in some “direction” in metamathematical space, potentially jumping far away from the entailment fabric currently within the purview of some mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>And one feature of this—very common in ruliology—is that one may <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p753--undecidability-and-intractability/'>run into undecidability</a>. The “nearby” entailment fabric of the mathematical observer is in a sense “filled in enough” that it doesn’t typically have infinite proof paths of the kind associated with undecidability. But something reached by experimental mathematics has no such guarantee. </p>\n<p>What’s good of course is that experimental mathematics can discover phenomena that are “far away” from existing mathematics. But (like in automated theorem proving) there isn’t necessarily any human-accessible “narrative explanation” (and if there’s undecidability there may be no “finite explanation” at all).</p>\n<p>So how does this all relate to our whole discussion of new ideas about the foundations of mathematics? In the past we might have thought that mathematics must ultimately progress just by working out more and more consequences of particular axioms. But what we’ve argued is that there’s a fundamental infrastructure even far below axiom systems—whose low-level exploration is the subject of ruliology. But the thing we call mathematics is really something higher level. </p>\n<p>Axiom systems are some kind of intermediate modeling layer—a kind of “assembly language” that can be used as a wrapper above the “raw ruliad”. In the end, we’ve argued, the details of this language won’t matter for typical things we call mathematics. But in a sense the situation is very much like in practical computing: we want an “assembly language” that makes it easiest to do the typical high-level things we want. In practical computing that’s often achieved with RISC instruction sets. In mathematics we typically imagine using axiom systems like ZFC. But—as reverse mathematics has tended to indicate—there are probably much more accessible axiom systems that could be used to reach the mathematics we want. (And ultimately even <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC is limited</a> in what it can reach.)</p>\n<p>But if we could find such a “RISC” axiom system for mathematics it has the potential to make practical more extensive exploration of the entailment cone. It’s also conceivable—though not guaranteed—that it could be “designed” to be more readily understood by humans. But in the end actual human-level mathematics will typically operate at a level far above it. </p>\n<p>And now the question is whether the “physicalized general laws of mathematics” that we’ve discussed can be used to make conclusions directly about human-level mathematics. We’ve identified a few features—like the very possibility of high-level mathematics, and the expectation of extensive dualities between mathematical fields. And we know that basic commonalities in structural features can be captured by things like category theory. But the question is what kinds of deeper general features can be found, and used.</p>\n<p>In physics our everyday experience immediately makes us think about “large-scale features” far above the level of atoms of space. In mathematics our typical experience so far has been at a lower level. So now the challenge is to think more globally, more metamathematically and, in effect, more like in physics.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, what we call mathematics is what mathematical observers perceive. So if we ask about the future of mathematics we must also ask about the future of mathematical observers.</p>\n<p>If one looks at the history of physics there was already much to understand just on the basis of what we humans could “observe” with our unaided senses. But gradually as more kinds of detectors became available—from microscopes to telescopes to amplifiers and so on—the domain of the physical observer was expanded, and the perceived laws of physics with it. And today, as the practical computational capability of observers increases, we can expect that we’ll gradually see new kinds of physical laws (say associated with hitherto “it’s just random” molecular motion or other features of systems). </p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, we can see our characteristics as physical observers as being associated with “experiencing” the ruliad from one particular “vantage point” in rulial space (just as we “experience” physical space from one particular vantage point in physical space). Putative “aliens” might experience the ruliad from a different vantage point in rulial space—leading them to have laws of physics utterly incoherent with our own. But as our technology and ways of thinking progress, we can expect that we’ll gradually be able to expand our “presence” in rulial space (just as we do with spacecraft and telescopes in physical space). And so we’ll be able to “experience” different laws of physics.</p>\n<p><a name='paramathematics'></a>We can expect the story to be very similar for mathematics. We have “experienced” mathematics from a certain vantage point in the ruliad. Putative aliens might experience it from another point, and build their own “paramathematics” utterly incoherent with our mathematics. The “natural evolution” of our mathematics corresponds to a gradual expansion in the entailment fabric, and in a sense a gradual spreading in rulial space. Experimental mathematics has the potential to launch a kind of “metamathematical space probe” which can discover quite different mathematics. At first, though, this will tend to be a piece of “raw ruliology”. But, if pursued, it potentially points the way to a kind of “colonization of rulial space” that will gradually expand the domain of the mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>The physicalized general laws of mathematics we’ve discussed here are based on features of current mathematical observers (which in turn are highly based on current physical observers). What these laws would be like with “enhanced” mathematical observers we don’t yet know. </p>\n<p>Mathematics as it is today is a great example of the “humanization of raw computation”. Two other examples are theoretical physics and computational language. And in all cases there is the potential to gradually expand our scope as observers. It’ll no doubt be a mixture of technology and methods along with expanded cognitive frameworks and understanding. We can use ruliology—or experimental mathematics—to “jump out” into the raw ruliad. But most of what we’ll see is “non-humanized” computational irreducibility. </p>\n<p>But perhaps somewhere there’ll be another slice of computational reducibility: a different “island” on which “alien” general laws can be built. But for now we exist on our current “island” of reducibility. And on this island we see the particular kinds of general laws that we’ve discussed. We saw them first in physics. But there <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>we discovered that they could emerge</a> quite generically from a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>lower-level computational structure</a>—and ultimately from the very general structure that we call the ruliad. And now, as we’ve discussed here, we realize that the thing we call mathematics is actually based on exactly the same foundations—with the result that it should show the same kinds of general laws.</p>\n<p>It’s a rather different view of mathematics—and its foundations—than we’ve been able to form before. But the deep connection with physics that we’ve discussed allows us to now have a physicalized view of metamathematics, which informs both what mathematics really is now, and what the future can hold for the remarkable pursuit that we call mathematics. </p>\n<style type='text/css'>\n\t#blog #content .post_content h2#some-personal-history-the-evolution-of-these-ideas {\n    border-top: solid 1px #ccc;\n    padding-top: 35px;\n    margin-top: 25px;\n</style>\n<h2 id='some-personal-history-the-evolution-of-these-ideas'>Some Personal History: The Evolution of These Ideas</h2>\n<p>It’s been a long personal journey to get to the ideas described here—stretching back nearly 45 years. Parts have been quite direct, steadily building over the course of time. But other parts have been surprising—even shocking. And to get to where we are now has required me to rethink some very long-held assumptions, and adopt what I had believed was a rather different way of thinking—even though, ironically, I’ve realized in the end that many aspects of this way of thinking pretty much mirror what I’ve done all along at a practical and technological level.</p>\n<p>Back in the late 1970s as a young theoretical physicist I had discovered the “secret weapon” of using computers to do mathematical calculations. By 1979 I had outgrown existing systems and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>decided to build my own</a>. But what should its foundations be? A key goal was to represent the processes of mathematics in a computational way. I thought about the methods I’d found effective in practice. I studied the history of mathematical logic. And in the end I came up with what seemed to me at the time the most obvious and direct approach: that everything should be based on transformations for symbolic expressions.</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure this was actually a good general approach to computation of all kinds—and the system we released in 1981 was named <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/smp-reference-manual.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>SMP (“Symbolic Manipulation Program”)</a> to reflect this generality. History has indeed borne out the strength of the symbolic expression paradigm—and it’s from that we’ve been able to build the huge tower of technology that is the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>modern Wolfram Language</a>. But all along mathematics has been an important use case—and in effect we’ve now seen four decades of validation that the core idea of transformations on symbolic expressions is a good metamodel of mathematics.</p>\n<p>When <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>Mathematica was first released in 1988</a> we called it “A System for Doing Mathematics by Computer”, where by “doing mathematics” we meant doing computations in mathematics and getting results. People soon did all sorts of experiments on using Mathematica to create and present proofs. But the overwhelming majority of actual usage was for directly computing results—and almost nobody seemed interested in seeing the inner workings, presented as a proof or otherwise. </p>\n<p>But in the 1980s I had <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>started my work on exploring the computational universe of simple programs</a> like cellular automata. And doing this was all about looking at the ongoing behavior of systems—or in effect the (often computationally irreducible) history of computations. And even though I sometimes talked about using my computational methods to do “experimental mathematics”, I don’t think I particularly thought about the actual progress of the computations I was studying as being like mathematical processes or proofs.</p>\n<p>In 1991 I started working on what became <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and in doing so I tried to systematically study possible forms of computational processes—and I was soon led to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p88--sequential-substitution-systems/'>substitution systems</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p102--symbolic-systems/'>symbolic systems</a> which I viewed in their different ways as being minimal idealizations of what would become Wolfram Language, as well as to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway systems</a>. There were some areas to which I was pretty sure the methods of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would apply. Three that I wasn’t sure about were biology, physics and mathematics.</p>\n<p>But by the late 1990s I had worked out quite a bit about the first two, and started looking at mathematics. I knew that Mathematica and what would become Wolfram Language were good representations of “practical mathematics”. But I assumed that to understand the foundations of mathematics I should look at the traditional low-level representation of mathematics: axiom systems. </p>\n<p>And in doing this I was soon able to simplify to multiway systems—with proofs being paths:</p>\n<p><a alt=\"Page 775\" title=\"Page 775\" href=\"https://wolframscience.com/nks/p775--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/\"><img alt=\"Page 775—click to enlarge\" title=\"Page 775\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/nks-775-2xA.png\" style=\"width:100%;max-width: 309px;height:auto;\"></a><a alt=\"Page 777\" title=\"Page 777\" href=\"https://wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/\"><img alt=\"Page 777—click to enlarge\" title=\"Page 777\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/nks-777-2xA.png\" style=\"width:100%;max-width: 311px;height:auto;\"></a></p>\n<p>I had long wondered what the detailed relationships between things like my idea of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> and earlier results in mathematical logic were. And I was pleased at how well many things could be clarified—and explicitly illustrated—by thinking in terms of multiway systems. </p>\n<p>My experience in exploring simple programs in general had led to the conclusion that computational irreducibility and therefore undecidability were quite ubiquitous. So I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p793--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>considered it quite a mystery</a> why undecidability seemed so rare in the mathematics that mathematicians typically did. I suspected that in fact undecidability was lurking close at hand—and I got some evidence of that by doing experimental mathematics. But why weren’t mathematicians running into this more? I came to suspect that it had something to do with the history of mathematics, and with the idea that mathematics had tended to expand its subject matter by asking “How can this be generalized while still having such-and-such a theorem be true?”</p>\n<p>But I also wondered about the particular axiom systems that had historically been used for mathematics. They all fit easily on a couple of pages. But why these and not others? Following my general “ruliological” approach of exploring all possible systems I started just <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p804--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>enumerating possible axiom systems</a>—and soon found out that many of them had rich and complicated implications. </p>\n<p>But where among these possible systems did the axiom systems historically used in mathematics lie? I did searches, and at about the 50,000th axiom was able to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--searching-for-logic-axioms/'>find the simplest axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>. Proving that it was correct gave me my first serious <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p811--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>experience with automated theorem proving</a>.</p>\n<p>But what kind of a thing was the proof? I made some attempt to understand it, but it was clear that it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>wasn&#8217;t something a human could readily understand</a>—and reading it felt a bit like trying to read machine code. I recognized that the problem was in a sense a lack of “human connection points”—for example of intermediate lemmas that (like words in a human language) had a contextualized significance. I wondered about how one could find lemmas that “humans would care about”? And I was surprised to discover that at least for the “named theorems” of Boolean algebra a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p817--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>simple criterion could reproduce them</a>. </p>\n<p>Quite a few years went by. Off and on I thought about two ultimately related issues. One was how to represent the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Trace.html'>execution histories</a> of Wolfram Language programs. And the other was how to represent proofs. In both cases there seemed to be all sorts of detail, and it seemed difficult to have a structure that would capture what would be needed for further computation—or any kind of general understanding.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in 2009, we released <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>. One of its features was that it had <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/pro-features/step-by-step-solutions/'>“step-by-step” math computations</a>. But these weren’t “general proofs”: rather they were narratives synthesized in very specific ways for human readers. Still, a core concept in Wolfram|Alpha—and the Wolfram Language—is the idea of integrating in knowledge about as many things as possible in the world. We’d done this for cities and movies and lattices and animals and much more. And I thought about doing it for mathematical theorems as well.</p>\n<p>We did a <a href='https://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/FinalReport.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>pilot project</a>—on theorems about continued fractions. We trawled through the mathematical literature assessing the difficulty of extending the “natural math understanding” we’d built for Wolfram|Alpha. I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>imagined a workflow</a> which would mix automated theorem generation with theorem search—in which one would define a mathematical scenario, then say “tell me interesting facts about this”. And in 2014 we set about engaging the mathematical community in a <a href='https://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/computable-archive-of-mathematics.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>large-scale curation effort</a> to formalize the theorems of mathematics. But try as we might, only people already involved in math formalization seemed to care; with few exceptions working mathematicians just didn’t seem to consider it relevant to what they did.</p>\n<p>We continued, however, to push slowly forward. We worked with proof assistant developers. We curated various kinds of mathematical structures (like <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/FunctionSpace.html'>function spaces</a>). I had estimated that we’d need more than a thousand new Wolfram Language functions to cover “modern pure mathematics”, but without a clear market we couldn’t motivate the huge design (let alone implementation) effort that would be needed—though, partly in a nod to the intellectual origins of mathematics, we did for example do a project that has succeeded in finally <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/12/plane-geometry/euclids-elements.html'>making Euclid-style geometry computable</a>.</p>\n<p>Then in the latter part of the 2010s a couple more “proof-related” things happened. Back in 2002 we’d started using equational logic automated theorem proving to get results in functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FullSimplify.html'>FullSimplify</a></tt>. But we hadn’t figured out how to present the proofs that were generated. In 2018 we finally introduced <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>—allowing programmatic access to proofs, and making it feasible for me to explore collections of proofs in bulk.</p>\n<p>I had for decades been interested in what I’ve called “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>symbolic discourse language</a>”: the extension of the idea of computational language to “everyday discourse”—and to the kind of thing one might want for example to express in legal contracts. And between this and our involvement in the idea of computational contracts, and things like <a href='https://wolframblockchainlabs.com/'>blockchain technology</a>, I started exploring questions of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>AI ethics</a> and “constitutions”. At this point we’d also started to introduce <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/featureset/machine-learning/'>machine-learning-based functions</a> into the Wolfram Language. And—with my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p810--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>“human incomprehensible” Boolean algebra proof</a> as “empirical data”—I started <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>exploring general questions of explainability</a>, and in effect proof.</p>\n<p>And not long after that came the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>surprise breakthrough of our Physics Project</a>. Extending my ideas from the 1990s about computational foundations for fundamental physics it suddenly became possible finally to understand the underlying origins of the main known laws of physics. And core to this effort—and particularly to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>understanding of quantum mechanics</a>—were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway systems</a>.</p>\n<p>At first we just used the knowledge that multiway systems <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>could also represent axiomatic mathematics</a> and proofs to provide analogies for our thinking about physics (“quantum observers might in effect be doing critical-pair completions”, “causal graphs are like higher categories”, etc.) But then we started wondering whether the phenomenon of the emergence that we’d seen for the familiar laws of physics might also affect mathematics—and whether it could give us something like a “bulk” version of metamathematics.</p>\n<p>I had long studied the transition from discrete “computational” elements to “bulk” behavior, first following my interest in the Second Law of thermodynamics, which stretched <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>all the way back to age 12 in 1972</a>, then following my work on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-4--history-of-cellular-automaton-fluids/'>cellular automaton fluids in the mid-1980s</a>, and now with the emergence of physical space from underlying hypergraphs in our Physics Project. But what might “bulk” metamathematics be like? </p>\n<p>One feature of our Physics Project—in fact shared with thermodynamics—is that certain aspects of its observed behavior depend very little on the details of its components. But what did they depend on? We realized that it all had to do with the observer—and their interaction (according to what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>I&#8217;ve described as the 4th paradigm for science</a>) with the general “multicomputational” processes going on underneath. For physics we had some idea what characteristics an “observer like us” might have (and actually they seemed to be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>closely related to our notion of consciousness</a>). But what might a “mathematical observer” be like?</p>\n<p>In its original framing we talked about our Physics Project as being about “finding the rule for the universe”. But right around the time we launched the project we realized that that wasn’t really the right characterization. And we started talking about <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rulial multiway systems</a> that instead “run every rule”—but in which an observer perceives only some small slice, that in particular can show emergent laws of physics.</p>\n<p>But what is this “run every rule” structure? In the end it’s something very fundamental: the entangled limit of all possible computations—that I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. The ruliad basically depends on nothing: it’s unique and its structure is a matter of formal necessity. So in a sense the ruliad “necessarily exists”—and, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>I argued, so must our universe</a>. </p>\n<p>But we can think of the ruliad not only as the foundation for physics, but also as the foundation for mathematics. And so, I concluded, if we believe that the physical universe exists, then we must <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>conclude—a bit like Plato—that mathematics exists too</a>.</p>\n<p>But how did all this relate to axiom systems and ideas about metamathematics? I had two additional pieces of input from the latter half of 2020. First, following up on a note in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I had done an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>extensive study of the “empirical metamathematics”</a> of the network of the theorems in Euclid, and in a couple of math formalization systems. And second, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of their invention essentially as “primitives for mathematics”, I had done an extensive ruliological and other <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>study of combinators</a>.</p>\n<p>I <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/physics-project-working-sessions'>began to work</a> on this current piece in the fall of 2020, but felt there was something I was missing. Yes, I could study axiom systems using the formalism of our Physics Project. But was this really getting at the essence of mathematics? I had long assumed that axiom systems really were the “raw material” of mathematics—even though I’d long gotten signals they weren’t really a good representation of how serious, aesthetically oriented pure mathematicians thought about things.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we’d always had as a target to reproduce the known laws of physics. But what should the target be in understanding the foundations of mathematics? It always seemed like it had to revolve around axiom systems and processes of proof. And it felt like validation when it became clear that the same concepts of “substitution rules applied to expressions” seemed to span my earliest efforts to make math computational, the underlying structure of our Physics Project, and “metamodels” of axiom systems. </p>\n<p>But somehow the ruliad—and the idea that if physics exists so must math—made me realize that this wasn’t ultimately the right level of description. And that axioms were some kind of intermediate level, between the “raw ruliad”, and the “humanized” level at which pure mathematics is normally done. At first I found this hard to accept; not only had axiom systems dominated thinking about the foundations of mathematics for more than a century, but they also seemed to fit so perfectly into my personal “symbolic rules” paradigm.</p>\n<p>But gradually I got convinced that, yes, I had been wrong all this time—and that axiom systems were in many respects missing the point. The true foundation is the ruliad, and axiom systems are a rather-hard-to-work-with “machine-code-like” description below the inevitable general “physicalized laws of metamathematics” that emerge—and that imply that for observers like us there’s a fundamentally higher-level approach to mathematics. </p>\n<p>At first I thought this was incompatible with my general computational view of things. But then I realized: “No, quite the opposite!” All these years I’ve been building the Wolfram Language precisely to connect “at a human level” with computational processes—and with mathematics. Yes, it can represent and deal with axiom systems. But it’s never felt particularly natural. And it’s because they’re at an awkward level—neither at the level of the raw ruliad and raw computation, nor at the level where we as humans define mathematics.</p>\n<p>But now, I think, we begin to get some clarity on just what this thing we call mathematics really is. What I’ve done here is just a beginning. But between its explicit computational examples and its conceptual arguments I feel it’s pointing the way to a broad and incredibly fertile new understanding that—even though I didn’t see it coming—I’m very excited is now here. </p>\n<h2 id='notes-and-thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Notes &#038; Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>For more than 25 years Elise Cawley has been telling me her thematic (and rather Platonic) view of the foundations of mathematics—and that basing everything on constructed axiom systems is a piece of modernism that misses the point.

Think of it as the entangled limit of everything that is computationally possible: the result of following all possible computational rules in all possible ways. It’s yet another surprising construct that’s arisen from our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>. And it’s one that I think has extremely deep implications—both in science and beyond.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the ruliad is a strange and profoundly abstract thing. But it’s something very universal—a kind of ultimate limit of all abstraction and generalization. And it encapsulates not only all formal possibilities but also everything about our physical universe—and everything we experience can be thought of as sampling that part of the ruliad that corresponds to our particular way of perceiving and interpreting the universe.</p>\n<p>We’re going to be able to say many things about the ruliad without engaging in all its technical details. (And—it should be said at the outset—we’re still only at the very beginning of nailing down those technical details and setting up the difficult mathematics and formalism they involve.) But to ground things here, let’s start with a slightly technical discussion of what the ruliad is.<span id=\"more-33541\"></span></p>\n<p>In the language of our Physics Project, it’s the ultimate limit of all <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rulial multiway systems</a>. And as such, it traces out the entangled consequences of progressively applying all possible computational rules. </p>\n<p>Here is an example of an <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>ordinary multiway system</a> based on the string replacement rules {A&nbsp;→&nbsp;AB,&nbsp;BB&nbsp;→&nbsp;A} (indicated respectively by blueish and reddish edges):</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg1.png\" alt='' title='' width='529' height='301' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At each step, the rules are applied in all possible ways to each state. Often this generates multiple new states, leading to branching in the graph. But, importantly, there can also be merging—from multiple states being transformed to the same state.</p>\n<p>The idea of a rulial multiway system is not just to apply particular rules in all possible ways, but to apply all possible rules of a given form. For example, if we consider “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-multiway-graph-structures/' target=_blank rel=noopener>1&nbsp;→&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2&nbsp;→&nbsp;1&nbsp;A,&nbsp;B string rules</a>”, the possible rules are</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg2.png\" alt='' title='' width='345' height='33' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>and the resulting multiway graph is (where now we’re using purple to indicate that there are edges for every possible rule):</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg3.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='207' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Continuing a little longer, and with a different layout, we get:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/04/1110swimg4B.png\" alt='' title='' width='379' height='' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This may already look a little complicated. But the ruliad is something in a sense infinitely more complicated. Its concept is to use not just all rules of a given form, but all possible rules. And to apply these rules to all possible initial conditions. And to run the rules for an infinite number of steps. </p>\n<p>The pictures above can be thought of as coarse finite approximations to the ruliad. The full ruliad involves taking the infinite limits of all possible rules, all possible initial conditions and all possible steps. Needless to say, this is a complicated thing to do, and there are many subtleties yet to work out about how to do it.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most obviously difficult issue is how conceivably to enumerate “all possible rules”.

But equivalence entangles them.</p>\n<p>The full ruliad is in effect a representation of all possible computations. And what gives it structure is the equivalences that exist between states generated by different computations. In a sense, there are two forces at work: the “forward” effect of the progress of computation, and the “sideways” effect of equivalences that entangle different computations. (Mathematically this can be thought of as being like decomposing the ruliad structure in terms of fibrations and foliations.)</p>\n<h2 id='experiencing-the-ruliad'>Experiencing the Ruliad</h2>\n<p>In thinking about finding a fundamental theory of physics, one thing always bothered me. Imagine we successfully identify a rule that describes everything about our universe. Then the obvious next question will be: “Why this rule, and not another?” Well, how about if actually the universe in effect <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#why-this-universe-the-relativity-of-rules'>just runs every possible rule</a>? What would this mean? It means that in a sense the “full story” of the universe is just the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But the ruliad contains everything that is computationally possible. So why then do we have the perception that the universe has specific laws, and that definite things happen in it?</p>\n<p>It all has to do with the fact that we are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>bounded observers</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>embedded within the ruliad</a>. We never get to see the full ruliad; we just sample tiny parts of it, parsing them according to our particular <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>methods of perception and analysis</a>. And the crucial point is that for coherent observers like us, there are certain robust features that we will inevitably see in the ruliad. And these features turn out to include <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>fundamental laws of our physics</a>, in particular general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>One can imagine an observer very different from us (say some kind of alien intelligence) who would sample different aspects of the ruliad, and deduce different laws. But one of the surprising core discoveries of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> is that even an observer with quite basic features like us will experience laws of physics that precisely correspond to ones we know.</p>\n<p>An analogy (that’s actually ultimately the result of the same underlying phenomenon) may help to illustrate what’s going on. Consider molecules in a gas. The molecules bounce around in a complicated pattern that depends on their detailed properties. But an observer like us doesn’t trace this whole pattern. Instead we only observe certain “coarse-grained” features. And the point is that these features are largely independent of the detailed properties of the molecules—and robustly correspond to our standard laws of physics, like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>. But a different kind of observer, sampling and “parsing” the system differently, could in principle identify different features, corresponding to different laws of physics.</p>\n<p>One of the conceptual difficulties in thinking about how we perceive the ruliad is that it’s a story of “self-observation”. Essentially by the very definition of the ruliad, we ourselves are part of it. We never get to “see the whole ruliad from the outside”. We only get to “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>experience it from the inside</a>”.</p>\n<p>In some ways it’s a bit like our efforts to construct the ruliad. In the end, the ruliad involves infinite rules, infinite initial conditions, and infinite time. But any way of assembling the ruliad from pieces effectively involves making particular choices about how we take those infinite limits. And that’s pretty much like the fact that as entities embedded within the ruliad, we have to make particular choices about how to sample it.</p>\n<p>One of the remarkable aspects of the ruliad is that it’s in some sense the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-laws-of-the-rulial-universe'>unique ultimately inevitable and necessary formal object</a>. If one sets up some particular computational system or mathematical theory, there are choices to be made. But in the ruliad there are no choices. Because everything is there. And in a sense every aspect of the structure of the ruliad is just something formally necessary. It requires no outside input; it is just a formal consequence of the meaning of terms, like the abstract fact <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg14.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. </p>\n<p>But while the ruliad is unique, the description of it is not. In constructing it, one can imagine using Turing machines or hypergraph rewriting systems or indeed any other kind of computational system. Each will ultimately lead to the same limiting object that is the ruliad, but each of them can be thought of as defining a different coordinate system for describing the ruliad. </p>\n<p>The very generality of the ruliad makes it unsurprising that there is vast diversity in how it can be described. And in a sense each possible description is like a possible way of experiencing the ruliad. In analogy to the (deeply related) situation with spacetime in general relativity, we might say that there are many reference frames in which to experience the ruliad—but it’s always the same ruliad underneath.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that the “ruliad from the outside” could seem very different from any “internal” experience of it by an observer like us. As an example, consider a simple finite approximation to the ruliad, built from string substitution systems. In what we did above, we always started from a specific initial condition. But the full ruliad involves starting from all possible initial conditions. (Of course, one could always just say one starts from a “null” initial condition, then have rules of the form null&nbsp;→&nbsp;everything.) So now let’s consider starting from all possible strings, say of length 4. If we use all possible 2-element-to-2-element rules, the finite approximation to the ruliad that we’ll get will be:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg15.png\" alt='' title='' width='546' height='411' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg15_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='15_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='15_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At some level this is a simple structure, and—as is inevitable for any finite approximation to the ruliad—its <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TransitiveClosureGraph.html'>transitive closure</a> is just the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CompleteGraph.html'>complete graph</a>:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg16.png\" alt='' title='' width='546' height='411' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg16_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='16_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='16_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So why doesn’t this mean that the ruliad is somehow trivial? A key part of the story is that we never get to “see the ruliad from the outside” like this. We are always part of it, sampling it according to some procedure, or, somewhat equivalently, thinking about constructing it according to some procedure.</p>\n<p>As an analogy, consider the real numbers. The whole continuum of all real numbers is “from the outside” in many ways a simple construct. But if we imagine actually trying to construct real numbers, say digit by digit, according to some definite procedure, then we’re dealing precisely with what <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-4--computable-reals/'>Turing machines were originally invented to model</a>, and the whole structure of computation is involved. (As we’ll see, our way of thinking about “observers like us” is ultimately quite related to “Turing machines with bounded descriptions”.)</p>\n<p>In a sense, at an outside “holistic” level, the ruliad has a certain simple perfection. But as soon as you try to look at “what’s in the ruliad”, you have to parametrize or coordinatize it, and then you’re inevitably exposed to its intricate internal structure.</p>\n<h2 id='observers-like-us'>Observers Like Us</h2>\n<p>One could imagine very different ways in which entities embedded within the ruliad could “experience” it. But what’s most relevant for us is how “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers like us</a>” do it—and how we manage to synthesize from what’s going on in the ruliad our perception of reality, and our view of how our physical universe works.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by talking not about the full ruliad but rather about models in our Physics Project based on specific underlying rules. At the lowest level, we have a “machine-code” description of the universe is which everything just consists of a network of “atoms of space” that is continually being updated—and which we can think of as carrying out a giant, if incoherent, computation, full of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>. But the remarkable fact is that somehow we, as observers of this, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#observers-and-their-physics'>manage to pick out of it a certain slice</a> that ends up showing coherent, computationally reducible features—that for example seem to reproduce our known laws of physics.</p>\n<p>How does this work? Partly it has to do with features of us as observers, partly with features of how the universe fundamentally works, and partly with an interplay between these. </p>\n<p>The first crucial feature of us as observers is that we’re computationally bounded: the way we “parse” the universe involves doing an amount of computation that’s absolutely tiny compared to all the computation going on in the universe. We sample only a tiny part of what’s “really going on underneath”, and we aggregate many details to get the summary that represents our perception of the universe.</p>\n<p>But why should that summary have any coherence? Basically it’s because we impose coherence through our definition of how observers like us work. One part of the universe will be affected by others. But to consider part of the universe as an “observer”, there has to be a certain coherence to it. The behavior of the universe somehow has to imprint itself on a “medium” that has a certain coherence and consistency.</p>\n<p>Down at the level of atoms of space, everything is always changing. But we can still identify emergent features that have a certain persistence. And it’s out of those features that what we call observers are built. Given only the atoms of space with all their computationally irreducible behavior, it’s not at the outset obvious that any real persistence could exist or be identified. But in our models we expect that there will, for example, be essentially <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>topological features that correspond to particles</a> that persistently maintain their identity. </p>\n<p>And the point is that we can expect to “aggregate up” much further and be able to identify something like a human observer—that we can consider to persistently maintain its identity to the point where phenomena from the universe can be “systematically imprinted” on it. </p>\n<p>Down at the level of atoms of space, there’s a whole multiway graph of possible sequences of updates that can occur—with each path in effect corresponding to a different “thread of time” for the universe. But it’s a crucial fact about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>us as observers of the universe</a> that we don’t perceive all those branching and merging threads of time. Instead, we imagine that we have a single, definite thread of experience—in which everything is sequentialized in time. </p>\n<p>I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>argued elsewhere</a> that this sequentialization in time is a defining characteristic of “human-like consciousness”. And it turns out that one of its consequences is that it implies that the particular perception we will have of the universe must be one in which there are laws of physics that correspond to ones we know.</p>\n<p>It’s not obvious, by the way, that if we sequentialize time we can form any consistent view of the universe. But the phenomenon of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal invariance</a>—which seems ultimately to be guaranteed by the fundamental structure of the ruliad—turns out to imply that we can expect a certain generalized relativistic invariance that will inevitably lead to eventual consistency. </p>\n<p>The notion of sequentialization in time is closely related to the idea that—even though our individual atoms of space are continually changing—we can view ourselves as having a coherent existence through time. And there’s a similar phenomenon for space. At the outset, it’s not obvious that there can be “pure motion”, in which something can move in space without “fundamentally changing”. But it turns out again to be consistent to view this as how things work for us: that even though we’re “made of different atoms of space” when we’re in different places, we can still imagine that in some sense we maintain the “same identity”.</p>\n<p>Down at the level of individual atoms of space, there really isn’t any coherent notion of space. And the fact that we form such a notion seems to be intimately connected to what we might think of as details of us. Most important is that we’re in a sense “intermediate in size” in the universe. We’re large relative to the effective distance between atoms of space (<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/units-and-scales/' target=_blank rel=noopener>which might be <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg17.png\" width= '54' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> m</a>), yet we’re small compared to the size of the whole universe (<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg18.png\" width= '46' height='20' align='absmiddle'></span> m). And the result is that we tend to aggregate the effects of many atoms of space, but still perceive different features of space (say, different gravitational fields) in different parts of the universe.</p>\n<p>The fact that we “naturally form a notion of space” also seems to depend on another issue of scale—that for us the speed of light “seems fast”. It takes our brains perhaps milliseconds to process anything we see. But the point is that this is very long compared to the time it takes light to get to us from objects in our typical local environment. And the result is that we tend to perceive there as being an instantaneous configuration of the world laid out in space, that “separately” changes in time. But if, for example, our brains ran much faster, or we were much bigger than we are, then the speed of light would “seem slower” to us, and we wouldn’t tend to form the notion of an “instantaneous state of space”.</p>\n<p>OK, so what about quantum mechanics? The most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics is that it implies that things in the universe follow not just one but many possible paths of history—which we only get to make certain kinds of measurements on. And in our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>Physics Project this is something natural</a>, and in fact inevitable. Given any particular configuration of the universe, there are many possible updates that can occur. And when we trace out all the possibilities, we get a multiway system, in which different threads of history continually branch and merge.</p>\n<p>So how do observers like us fit into this? Being part of the universe, we inevitably branch and merge, just like the rest of the universe. So to understand our experience, what we need to ask is how a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-quantum-observer'>“branching brain” will perceive a “branching universe”</a>. And the story is remarkably similar to what we discussed above for our experience of space and time: it all has to do with imagining ourselves to have a certain definite persistence.</p>\n<p>In other words, even if when “viewed from the outside” our brain might be following many different paths of history, “from the inside” we can still potentially assume that everything is conflated into a single thread of history. But will this ultimately be a consistent thing to do? Once again, causal invariance implies that it will. There are specific “quantum effects” where we can tell that there are multiple branches of history being followed, but in the end it’ll be consistent to imagine an “objective reality” about “what happened”.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine that there are abstract relations between atoms of space, and in the end the pattern of these relations defines the structure of physical space. But what about different branches of history in the multiway graph? Can we think of these as related? The answer is yes. For example, we can say that at a particular time, states on two branches are “adjacent” if they share an immediate ancestor in the multiway graph. And tracing through such connections we can develop a notion of “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>”—a kind of space in which states on different branches of history are laid out:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg19.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='364' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>One can think of branchial space as being defined by the pattern of entanglements between different branches of history. And in our Physics Project it turns out that the fundamental <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>laws of quantum mechanics seem to just be a direct translation of the fundamental laws of spacetime</a> into branchial space. And just like the speed of light governs the maximum rate at which effects can propagate in physical space, so similarly in our models there’s a “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/correspondence-between-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>maximum entanglement speed</a>” at which effects can propagate in branchial space.</p>\n<p>So what are we like as observers in branchial space? Just like in physical space, we can presumably be thought of as having a certain size in branchial space. We don’t yet know quite how to measure this size, but it’s surely related to the effective number of quantum degrees of freedom we involve. </p>\n<p>In our everyday experience of things like gases, we’re sufficiently large compared to individual molecules that we normally just perceive the gas as some kind of continuum fluid—and in normal circumstances we can’t even tell that it’s made of molecules. Well, it’s presumably the same kind of thing for physical space—where we’re even much larger compared to the atoms of space, and it’s a major challenge to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/the-wolfram-physics-project-a-one-year-update/#towards-experimental-implications'>figure out how to detect their presence</a>. What about for branchial space? As the underlying rules for the system get applied, different branches of history will in effect “move around” in branchial space in complex and computationally irreducible ways. And just like when we observe molecules in a gas, we’ll mostly just observe overall aggregate effects analogous to fluid mechanics—and only in special circumstances will we notice “quantum effects” that reveal the presence of multiple independent threads of history.</p>\n<h2 id='living-in-rulial-space'>Living in Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed how “observers like us” perceive models of physics of the type that arise in our Physics Project. But how will we perceive the whole ruliad? It begins with a generalization of the story for branchial space. Because now as well as having different branches associated with different updatings according to a particular rule, we have different branches associated with updatings according to different rules.</p>\n<p>And just as we can slice an ordinary multiway system at a particular time to get an instantaneous version of branchial space, so now we can slice a rulial multiway system to get an instantaneous version of what we can call rulial space—a space in which different branches can correspond not just to different histories, but to different rules for history.</p>\n<p>It’s a fairly complicated setup, with “pure branchial space” inevitably being deeply interwoven with rulial space. But as a first approximation, we can think of rulial space as being somewhat separate, and laid out so that different places in it correspond to the results of applying different rules—with nearby places effectively being associated with “nearby” rules.</p>\n<p>And just as we can think of effects propagating in branchial space, so also we can think of them propagating in rulial space. In branchial space we can talk about entanglement cones as the analog of light cones, and a maximum entanglement speed as the analog of the speed of light. In rulial space we can instead talk about “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>emulation cones</a>”—and a “maximum emulation speed”.</p>\n<p>In our rough approximation of rulial space, each point is in effect associated with a particular rule. So how do we “move” from one point to another? Effectively we have to be emulating the behavior of one rule by another. But why should it even be possible to do this? The answer is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>, which states that, in effect, most rules will be equivalent in their computational capabilities—and in particular they will be capable of universal computation, so that any given rule can always “run a program” that will make it emulate any other rule.</p>\n<p>One can think of the program as an interpreter or translator that goes from one rule to another. The Principle of Computational Equivalence tells one that such a translator must essentially always exist. But how fast will the translator run? Effectively that’s what distance in rulial space measures. Because to “do a certain translation”, branches in the rulial multiway system have to reach from one rule to another. But they can only do that at the maximum emulation speed. </p>\n<p>What does the maximum emulation speed measure? Effectively it corresponds to the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>raw computational processing speed of the universe</a>. We can think of representing computations in some language—say the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. Then the processing speed will be measured in “Wolfram Language tokens processed per second” (“WLT/s”). In some sense, of course, giving a value for this speed is just a way of relating our human units of time (say, seconds) to the “intrinsic unit of time” associated with the computational processing that’s going on in the universe. Or, in other words, it’s a kind of ultimate definition of a second relative to purely formal constructs.</p>\n<p>OK, but how does this relate to us as observers embedded within the ruliad? Well, just as we imagine that—along with the rest of the universe—we’re continually branching and merging in branchial space, so also this will be what happens in rulial space. In other words—like the rest of the universe—our brains aren’t following a particular rule; they’re following branching and merging paths that represent all possible rules.</p>\n<p>But “from inside” we can still potentially imagine that we have a single thread of experience—effectively conflating what happens on all those different branches. And once again we can ask whether doing this will be consistent. And the answer seems to be that, yes, it can be. And what guarantees this is again a kind of “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#why-this-universe-the-relativity-of-rules'>rulial relativity</a>” that’s a consequence of causal invariance. There are many details here, which we’ll address to some extent later. But the broad outline is that causal invariance can be thought of as being associated with paths of history that diverge, eventually converging again. But since the ruliad contains paths corresponding to all possible rules, it’s basically inevitable that it will contain what’s needed to “undo” whatever divergence occurs. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean? Basically it’s saying that even though the universe is in some sense intrinsically “following all possible rules”—as represented by paths in the ruliad—we as observers of the universe can still “take the point of view” that the universe follows a particular rule. Well, actually, it’s not quite a particular rule. Because just as we’re in some sense “quite big” in physical and presumably branchial space, so also we’re potentially “quite big” in rulial space.</p>\n<p>And being extended in rulial space is basically saying that we consider not just one, but a range of possible rules to be what describe the universe. How can it work this way? Well, as observers of the universe, we can try to deduce what the “true rule for the universe” is. But inevitably we have to do this by performing physical experiments, and then using inductive inference to try to figure out what the “rule for the universe is”. But the issue is that as entities embedded within the universe, we can only ever do a finite number of experiments—and with these we’ll never be able to precisely nail down the “true rule”; there’ll always be some uncertainty.</p>\n<p>When we think of ourselves as observers of the universe, there’s in a sense lots of “arbitrariness” in the way we’re set up. For example, we exist at a particular location in physical space—in our particular solar system and so on. Presumably we also exist at a particular location in branchial space, though it’s less clear how to “name” that. And in addition we exist at a particular location in rulial space.</p>\n<p>What determines that location? Essentially it’s determined by how we operate as observers: the particular sensory system we have, and the particular means of description that we’ve developed in our language and in the history of knowledge in our civilization. In principle we could imagine sensing or describing our universe differently. But the way we do it defines the particular place in rulial space at which we find ourselves.</p>\n<p>But what does all this mean in terms of the ruliad? The ruliad is the unique limiting structure formed by following all possible rules in all possible ways. But when we “observe the ruliad” we’re effectively “paying attention to” only particular aspects of it. Some of that “paying attention” we can conveniently describe in terms of our particular “location in the ruliad”. But some is more naturally described by thinking about equivalence classes in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>Given two states that exist in the ruliad, we have to ask whether as observers we want to consider them distinct, or whether we want to conflate them, and consider them “the same”. When we discussed the construction of the ruliad, we already had many versions of this issue. Indeed, whenever we said that two paths in the ruliad “merge”, that’s really just saying that we treat the outcomes as equivalent.</p>\n<p>“Viewed from the outside”, one could imagine that absolutely nothing is equivalent. Two hypergraphs produced in two different ways (and thus, perhaps, with differently labeled nodes) are “from the outside” in some sense different. But “viewed from the inside”, they pretty much have to be viewed as “the same”, in essence because all their effects will be the same. But at some level, even such conflation of differently labeled hypergraphs can be thought of as an “act of the observer”; something that one can only see works that way if one’s “observing it from inside the system”.</p>\n<p>But all the way through our description of the observer, it’s very much the same story: it’s a question of what should be considered equivalent to what. In sequentializing time, we’re effectively saying that “all of space” (or “all of branchial space”, or rulial space) should be considered “equivalent”. There are many subtle issues of equivalence that also arise in the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>construction of states in the ruliad from underlying tokens</a>, in defining what rules and initial conditions should be considered the same, and in many other places.</p>\n<p>The ruliad is in some sense the most complicated constructible object. But if we as computationally bounded observers are going to perceive things about it, we have to find some way to “cut it down to size”. And we do that by defining equivalence classes, and then paying attention only to those whole classes, not all the details of what’s going on inside them. But a key point is that because we are computationally bounded observers who imagine a certain coherence in their experience, there are strong constraints on what kinds of equivalence classes we can use.</p>\n<p>If we return again to the situation of molecules in a gas, we can say that we form equivalence classes in which we look only coarsely at the positions of molecules, in “buckets” defined by simple, bounded computations—and we don’t look at their finer details, with all the computational irreducibility they involve. And it’s because of this way of looking at the system that we conclude that it follows the Second Law of thermodynamics, exhibits fluid behavior, etc.</p>\n<p>And it’s very much the same story with the ruliad—and with the laws of physics. If we constrain the kind of way that we observe—or “parse”—the ruliad, then it becomes inevitable that the effective laws we’ll see will have certain features, which turns out apparently to be exactly what’s needed to reproduce known laws of physics. The full ruliad is in a sense very wild; but as observers with certain characteristics, we see a much tamer version of it, and in fact what we see is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#observers-reference-frames-and-emergent-laws'>capable of being described in terms of laws</a> that we can largely write just in terms of existing mathematical constructs.</p>\n<p>At the outset, we might have imagined that the ruliad would basically just serve as a kind of dictionary of possible universes—a “universe of all possible universes” in which each possible universe has different laws. But the ruliad is in a sense a much more complicated object. Rather than being a “dictionary” of possible separate universes, it is something that entangles together all possible universes. The Principle of Computational Equivalence implies a certain homogeneity to this entangled structure. But the crucial point is that we don’t “look at this structure from the outside”: we are instead observers embedded within the structure. And what we observe then depends on our characteristics. And it turns out that even very basic features of our consciousness and sensory apparatus in a sense inevitably lead to known laws of physics—and in a sense do so generically, independent of details of just where in rulial space we are, or exactly what slice of the ruliad we take.</p>\n<p>So far we’ve primarily talked about the ruliad in terms of physics and the fundamental structure of our physical universe. But the ruliad is actually something still more general than that. Because ultimately it is just created from the abstract concept of following all possible computational rules. And, yes, we can interpret these rules as representing things going on in our universe. But we can also interpret them as representing things going on in some other, less immediately physically realizable system. Or, for that matter, representing something purely formal, and, say, mathematical.</p>\n<p>This way of talking about the ruliad might make one think that it should be “considered a possible model” for our universe, or for other things. But the bizarre and surprising point is that it is more than that. It’s not just a possible model that might be one of many. Rather, it is the unique ultimate representation of all possible models, entangled together. As we’ve discussed, there are many subtle choices about how we observe the ruliad. But the ultimate ruliad itself is a unique thing, with no choice about what it is. </p>\n<p>As I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>discussed at more length elsewhere</a>, the ruliad is in a sense a representation of all possible necessary truths—a formal object whose structure is an inevitable consequence of the very notion of formalization. So how does this relate to the idea that the ruliad also at an ultimate level represents our physical universe? What I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>argued elsewhere</a> is that it means that the ultimate structure of our universe is a formal necessity. In other words, it’s a matter of formal necessity that the universe must exist, and have an ultimate ruliad structure. The fact that we perceive the universe to operate in a certain way—with our standard laws of physics, for example—is then a consequence of the particular way observers like us perceive it, which in turn depends on things like where in rulial space we happen to find ourselves.</p>\n<p>But beyond physics, what else might the ruliad represent? The ruliad is an ultimate example of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputation, and of what I’ve characterized as the fourth major paradigm for theoretical science</a>. Often in multicomputation, what’s of interest is multiway systems with specific underlying rules. And already at this level, much of the apparatus that we’ve described in connection with the ruliad also applies—and in a sense “trickles down” to give various universal results.</p>\n<p>But there are also definitely cases of multicomputation (other than physics) where the full notion of applying all possible rules is relevant. The global structures of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#metamathematics'>metamathematics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics'>linguistics</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#evolutionary-biology'>evolutionary biology</a> seem likely to provide examples—and in each case we can expect that at the core is the ruliad, with its unique structure. Of course, this doesn’t mean that what we observe must always be the same, because what we observe depends on our characteristics as an observer—and the characteristics of “being an observer” in metamathematics, for example, are surely different from those for economics or evolutionary biology, or, for that matter, physics. </p>\n<p>For sure, the “sensory apparatus” that we effectively use is different in different cases. But there are certain similar human-based features that still seem to apply. Whatever the domain, we always act as computationally bounded observers. And it seems that we also always have a certain coherence, consistently maintaining our “observerhood” through time or across some form of space. And it seems likely that these “human-induced” characteristics alone are sufficient to yield some very global implications for observed behavior.</p>\n<h2 id='the-view-from-mathematics'>The View from Mathematics</h2>\n<p>How should we think about the ruliad mathematically? In many ways, the ruliad is more an object of metamathematics than of mathematics itself. For in talking about the effects of all possible rules, it in a sense transcends individual mathematical theories—to describe a kind of metatheory of all possible theories.</p>\n<p>Given a particular mathematical axiom system, it’s rather easy to see <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>correspondence with a multiway system</a>. There are a variety of ways to set it up, but one approach is to think of states in the multiway system as being expressions in the language used for the axiom system, and then to think of rules in the multiway system as applying transformations on these expressions that implement axioms in the axiom system.</p>\n<p>For example, with the (Abelian semigroup) axioms</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg20.png\" alt='' title='' width='290' height='19' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg20_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='20_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='20_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>here’s a multiway system generated from the expression <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg21.png\" width= '78' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> by applying the (two-way) transformations defined by the axioms in all possible ways to each expression:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/sw1110v2img23.png\" alt='' title='' width='1358' height='570' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/sw1110img23_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='23_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='23_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But now from this graph we can read off the “theorem”:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg23.png\" alt='' title='' width='234' height='19' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg23_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='23_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='23_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A proof of this theorem</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg24.png\" alt='' title='' width='484' height='261' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg24_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>is just a path in the multiway graph:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg25.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='238' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg25_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='25_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='25_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A significantly less direct but still perfectly valid proof would correspond to the 13-step path:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg26.png\" alt='' title='' width='552' height='233' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg26_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='26_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='26_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s a slightly technical point, but perhaps worth mentioning that there are alternative ways to set up the correspondence between axiomatic mathematical systems and multiway systems. One such way is to take the states in the multiway system to be not expressions (like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg27.png\" width= '26' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>) but whole propositions (like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg28.png\" width= '71' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>). Axioms then show up as states, and the rules for the multiway system are “rules of inference” or “rules of entailment” that define how, say, pairs of propositions “entail” (or “imply”) other ones. (And, yes, this requires a generalized multiway system with not just 1 state&nbsp;→&nbsp;many states, but for example 2 states&nbsp;→&nbsp;1 state.) Typical automated theorem provers (like <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>) operate in this kind of setup, attempting to find paths that lead from initial propositions and axioms to some final state that corresponds to an “obviously true” proposition, like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg29.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>But whatever the detailed setup, the basic picture is that an axiomatic mathematical system has an associated multiway graph, in which paths correspond to proofs. Given the rules for the multiway system, there is in general no way to guarantee that the path (if it exists) corresponding to the proof of some particular result will be of bounded length, leading to the possibility of undecidability. But even when a path exists, it may require an irreducibly large amount of computation to find it. Still, finding such paths is what automated theorem provers do. For example, we know <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>(as I discovered in 2000) that ((<em>b</em>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<em>c</em>)&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;(<em>b</em>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;((<em>b</em>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<em>a</em>)&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;<em>b</em>))&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>a</em> is the minimal axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>, because <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt> finds a path that proves it.</p>\n<p>But this path—and the corresponding proof—is a very “non-human” construct (and, for example, in 21 years essentially no progress has been made in finding a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>“human-understandable narrative” for it</a>). And we can make an analogy here to the situation in physics. The individual rule applications in the multiway graph (or the proof) are like individual updating events applied to the atoms of space—and they show all kinds of complexity and computational irreducibility. But in physics, human observers work at a higher level. And the same, one suspects, is true in mathematics.</p>\n<p>Rather than looking at every detail of the multiway graph, human “mathematical observers” (i.e. pure mathematicians) in effect define all sorts of equivalences that conflate together different parts of the graph. If the individual updates in the multiway graph are like molecular dynamics, human pure mathematics seems to operate much more at the “fluid dynamics level”, concentrating on “broad mathematical constructs”, not the “machine code” of specific low-level axiomatic representations. (Of course, there are some situations, for example related to undecidability, where the “molecular dynamics” effectively “breaks through”.)</p>\n<p>We’ve outlined above (and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>discussed at length elsewhere</a>) how physical observers like us “parse” the low-level structure of the physical universe (and the ruliad). How might mathematical observers do it? A large part has to do with the identification of equivalences. And the key idea is that things which are considered equivalent should be assumed to be “the same”, and therefore “conflated for mathematical purposes”.</p>\n<p>The most elementary example of something like this is the statement (<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>already present in Euclid</a>) that if <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg31.png\" width= '36' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg32.png\" width= '34' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, then <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg33.png\" width= '35' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>. The extensionality axiom of set theory is a more sophisticated example. And the univalence axiom of homotopy type theory is perhaps the most sophisticated current version. </p>\n<p>There’s a very operational version of this that appears in automated theorem proving. Imagine that you’ve proved that <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg34.png\" width= '36' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg35.png\" width= '34' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. Then (by the assumed properties of equality) it follows that <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg36.png\" width= '35' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>. One way we could use this result is just to merge the nodes for <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg37.png\" width= '9' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg38.png\" width= '7' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. But a “bigger” thing we can do is to add the “completion” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg39.png\" width= '35' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> as a general rule for generating the multiway system.</p>\n<p>Consider, for example, the string substitution multiway system A ↔ AB:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg40.png\" alt='' title='' width='562' height='162' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg40_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='40_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='40_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But notice here that both ABA ↔ ABBA and ABA ↔ ABAB.

But we can also think of it as having done something else: not only has it defined equivalences between states; it’s also defined equivalences between paths—or in effect between proofs. (Or, put another way, it’s implementing homotopic equivalence between proofs. By the way, it’s an important feature of human mathematics that progress is typically measured in theorems proved; different proofs of the same theorem are normally implicitly considered equivalent in terms of the progress of mathematics.) </p>\n<p>In a <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10822.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>category theory interpretation</a>, transformations between states in the original multiway graph are like ordinary morphisms (1-morphisms). But when we’re making transformations between “proof paths”, this is like 2-morphisms. And just as we can add transformations between proofs, we can also add transformations between proofs-between-proofs, and so on. The result is that we can build up a whole hierarchy of higher and higher categories, eventually ending with an ∞-category. </p>\n<p>But now we can begin to see the connection with the ruliad. The ruliad is in a sense the result of taking the limit of adding more and more possible rules. Above we did this quite explicitly in terms of the original underlying rules, for example by enumerating possible strings or possible integer multipliers. </p>\n<p>But we can view successive completions as doing something very similar. Yes, the rules are enumerated in a different order. But in the end there’ll still be an infinite number of distinct rules being used. </p>\n<p>Of course there are many mathematical details missing here. But in broad outline, it seems that one can think of the approach to the ruliad as some kind of limit of successively higher categories. But this limit is something that’s been studied (albeit in the upper reaches of pure mathematics), and it’s an object called the ∞-groupoid. (It’s a groupoid because when all the rules are included things inevitably “go both ways”). So, OK, is the ruliad “just” the ∞-groupoid? Not quite. Because there are more rules and more initial conditions in the ruliad, even beyond those added by completions. And in the end the ruliad actually seems to be the ∞-category of ∞-groupoids, or <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03460.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>what&#8217;s called the (∞,1)-category</a>.</p>\n<p>But knowing that the ruliad can be thought of as composed of ∞-groupoids means that we can <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03460.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>apply mathematical ideas</a> about the ∞-groupoid to the ruliad. </p>\n<p>Probably the most important is Grothendieck’s hypothesis, which asserts that the ∞-groupoid inevitably has a topological and (with a few other conditions) ultimately geometric structure. In other words, even though one might have imagined that one constructed the ∞-groupoid from “pure logic” (or from pure formal axiomatic structures), the assertion is that the limiting object one obtains inevitably exhibits some kind of geometrical or “spatial” structure. </p>\n<p>Viewed in terms of the ruliad—and our explicit finite examples of it—this might not seem surprising. And indeed in our Physics Project, the whole concept of the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/' target=_blank rel=noopener>emergence of space from large-scale hypergraphs</a> is closely related. But here from Grothendieck’s hypothesis we’re basically seeing a general claim that the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/08/a-candidate-geometrical-formalism-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics-and-physics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>ruliad must have “inevitable geometry”</a>—and we can then view things like the emergence of space in our Physics Project as a kind of “trickle down” from results about the ruliad. (And in general, a big “application” of geometrical structure is the possibility of “pure motion”.)</p>\n<p>What does all this mean about the ruliad and mathematics? In a sense the ruliad represents all possible mathematics—the application of all possible rules, corresponding to all possible axiom systems. And from this “ultimate metamathematics”, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>human “mathematical observers”</a> are sampling pieces that correspond to the pure mathematics they consider of interest.</p>\n<p>Perhaps these will align with particular axiom systems of the kind automated theorem provers (or proof assistants) use. But things may be “sloppier” than that, with human mathematical observers effectively being extended in rulial space—and capable of making “fluid-dynamics-level” conclusions, even if not “molecular-dynamics-level” ones. </p>\n<p>But a key (and in some ways very surprising) point is that the ruliad can be viewed as the basis of both physics and mathematics. In some sense, physics and mathematics are at their core the same thing. They only “appear different” to us because the way we “observe” them is different. </p>\n<p>I plan to discuss the implications for mathematics at greater length elsewhere. But suffice it to say here that the existence of a common underlying core—namely the ruliad—for both physics and mathematics immediately allows one to start importing powerful results from physics into mathematics, and vice versa. It also allows one, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>as I have done elsewhere</a>, to start comparing the existence of the universe with the (Platonic-style) concept of the fundamental existence of mathematics.</p>\n<h2 id='the-view-from-computation-theory'>The View from Computation Theory</h2>\n<p>The ruliad can be thought of as an encapsulation of doing all possible computations in all possible ways.

But as before, there’s lots of subtlety in how this limit is taken. But we can at least characterize some ways of approaching it using ideas from computational complexity theory. Increasing the number of steps of evolution is like increasing the time complexity one allows. Increasing the “size of states” (e.g. the width of nonzero Turing machine tape) that one includes is like increasing the space complexity one allows. And increasing the complexity of the rule (as measured in the number of bits needed to specify it) is like increasing the algorithmic complexity one allows. The ruliad is what is obtained by taking all these computational resource measures to infinity. </p>\n<p>And a critical claim is that regardless of how this is done, the final ruliad construct one gets will always—at least in some sense—be the same. There will be many ways to coordinatize it, or to sample it, but the claim is that it’s always the same object that one’s dealing with. And ultimately the reason for this is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. Because it implies that whatever “computational parametrization” or “computational description language” one uses for the ruliad, one will almost always get something that can be viewed as “computationally equivalent”. </p>\n<p>We’ve talked about building up the ruliad using Turing machines. But what about other models of computation—like cellular automata or register machines or lambda calculus? As soon as there’s computation universality we know that we’ll get results that are at least in principle equivalent, because in a sense there’s only a “finite translation cost” associated with setting up an interpreter from one model of computation to another. Or, put another way, we can always emulate the application of the rule for one system by just a finite number of rule applications for the other system.</p>\n<p>But from computation universality alone we have no guarantee that there won’t be “extreme deformations” introduced by this deformation. What the Principle of Computational Equivalence says, however, is that almost always the deformations won’t have to be extreme. And indeed we can expect that particularly when multiple rules are involved, there’ll be rapid convergence almost always to a kind of “uniform equivalence” that ensures that the final structure of the ruliad is always the same.</p>\n<p>But the Principle of Computational Equivalence appears to say still more about the ruliad: it says that not only will the ruliad be the same independent of the “computational basis” used to construct it, but also that there’ll be a certain uniformity across the ruliad. Different “regions of the ruliad” might involve different specific rules or different patterns of their application. But the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that almost always the computations that happen will be equivalent, so that—at least at a certain scale—the structure associated with them will also be equivalent.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the ruliad contains so many different computations, one might imagine that it would show no particular uniformity or homogeneity. But the Principle of Computational Equivalence seems to imply that it necessarily does, and moreover that there must be a certain coherence to its structure—that one can interpret (in the style of Grothendieck’s hypothesis) as an inevitable emergent geometry.</p>\n<p>An individual computation corresponds to a path in the ruliad, going from its “input state” to its “output state”. In an ordinary deterministic computation, the path is restricted to always use the same rule at each step. In a nondeterministic computation, there can be different rules at different steps. But now we can formulate things like the P vs. NP problem essentially in terms of the geometry of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>Here’s a picture of the same finite Turing-machine-based approximation to the ruliad as above—but now with the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#deterministic-turing-machine-paths-in-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>paths that correspond to deterministic Turing machine computations</a> marked in red: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg46.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='472' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg46_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='46_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='46_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The P vs. NP problem basically asks roughly whether the deterministic computations (shown here in red) will eventually “fill the ruliad”, or whether the general nondeterministic computations that are part of the ruliad will always “reach further”. Once again, there are many complicated and subtle issues here. But it’s interesting to see how something like the P vs. NP problem might play out in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>In physics (and mathematics), we as human observers tend to sample the ruliad in a coarse-grained way, “noticing” only certain aspects of it. So is there an analog of this in computation theory—perhaps associated with certain characteristics of the “computation-theoretic observer”? There’s a potential answer, rather similar to what we’ve already seen in both physics and mathematics. </p>\n<p>The basic point is that in computation theory we tend to study classes of computations (say P or NP) rather than individual computations. And in doing this we are in a sense always conflating many different possible inputs and possible outputs—which we assume we do in a computationally bounded way (e.g. through polynomial-time transformations, etc.) </p>\n<p>Another thing is that we tend to focus more on the “experience of the end user” than the detailed activities of the “programmer”. In other words, we’re concerned more with what computational results are obtained, with what computational resources, rather than on the details of the program constructed to achieve this. Or, put another way, we tend to think about computation in terms of things like the successive evaluation of functions—and we conflate the different paths by which this is achieved.</p>\n<p>Most likely this means that there are “effective laws” that can be derived in this computational view of the ruliad, analogous to laws of physics like general relativity. So what might some other analogies be?</p>\n<p>A computation, as we’ve mentioned, corresponds to a path in the ruliad. And whenever there’s a possibility for an infinite path in the ruliad, this is a sign of undecidability: that there may be no finite way to determine whether a computation can reach a particular result. But what about cases when many paths converge to a point at which no further rules apply, or effectively “time stops”? This is the analog of a spacelike singularity—or a black hole—in the ruliad. And in terms of computation theory, it corresponds to something decidable: every computation one does will get to a result in finite time.</p>\n<p>One can start asking questions like: <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>What is the density of black holes in rulial space</a>? If we construct the ruliad using Turing machines, this is basically analogous to asking “What’s the density of halting Turing machines (+initial conditions) in rulial space?” And this is essentially given by <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-3--algorithmic-information-theory/'>Chaitin’s Ω</a>. </p>\n<p>But so is there some number Ω that we can just compute for the ruliad? Well, actually, no. Because the undecidability of the halting problem makes Ω noncomputable. One can get approximations to it, but—in the language of the ruliad—those will correspond to using particular samplings or particular reference frames. Or in other words, even the perceived density of “decidability black holes” in the ruliad depends on features of the observer.</p>\n<h2 id='whats-beyond-the-ruliad'>What&rsquo;s beyond the Ruliad?</h2>\n<p>In our Physics Project we usually talk of the universe “evolving through time” (albeit with many entangled threads of history). But if the ruliad and its structure is a matter of formal necessity, doesn’t that mean that the whole ruliad effectively “already exists”—“outside of time”? Well, in some sense it does. But ultimately that would only be relevant to us if we could “look at the ruliad from the outside”.</p>\n<p>And as observers like us within the ruliad, we necessarily have a different perception. Because <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>our consciousness</a>—with its computational boundedness—only gets to sample a certain sequence of pieces of the ruliad. If it were not for computational irreducibility, we might get to “jump around” in time. But computational irreducibility, together with our own computational boundedness, implies that our perception must necessarily just experience the passage of time through an irreducible process of computation.</p>\n<p>In other words, while in some sense the ruliad may all “already be there” when viewed from the outside, our own perception of it “from the inside” is necessarily a progressive one, that effectively corresponds to the passage of time.</p>\n<p>Could we experience the ruliad differently, even while being computationally bounded? If we think of the ruliad as a graph, then our usual “sequence of configurations of space at successive times” way of experiencing the ruliad is like a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/foliations-and-coordinates-on-causal-graphs/#p-255' target=_blank rel=noopener>breadth-first traversal</a>. But could we for example instead do a depth-first traversal, exploring all time before investigating different parts of space? (And, yes, something like this can happen in general relativity near an event horizon, or in connection with timelike singularities.)</p>\n<p>Later, we’ll discuss different ways to perceive the ruliad and the universe. But it seems to be a feature of anything we might call a coherent observer that there needs to be some form of progression in the perception. And so while we might not call it the passage of time, there’ll still be some way in which our exploration of the ruliad has a computationally irreducible process underneath.</p>\n<p>A very important <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#is-this-the-only-universe?'>claim about the ruliad is that it’s unique.</a> Yes, it can be coordinatized and sampled in different ways. But ultimately there’s only one ruliad. And we can trace the argument for this to the Principle of Computational Equivalence. In essence there’s only one ruliad because the Principle of Computational Equivalence says that almost all rules lead to computations that are equivalent. In other words, the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us that there’s only one ultimate equivalence class for computations.</p>\n<p>But what if we just imagine a “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p720--the-content-of-the-principle/'>hypercomputation</a>” not in that class? For example, imagine a hypercomputation (analogous, for example, to an oracle for a Turing machine) that in a finite number of steps will give us the result from an infinite number of steps of a computationally irreducible process. Such a hypercomputation isn’t part of our usual ruliad. But we could still formally imagine a hyperruliad that includes it—and indeed we could imagine a whole infinite hierarchy of successively larger and more powerful hyperruliads.</p>\n<p>But it’s a fundamental claim that we’re making—that can be thought of as a matter of natural science—that in our universe only computation can occur, not hypercomputation. </p>\n<p>At a purely formal level, there’s nothing wrong with hyperruliads. They exist as a matter of formal necessity just like the ordinary ruliad does. But the key point is that an observer embedded within the ruliad <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#why-this-universe-the-relativity-of-rules'>can never perceive a hyperruliad</a>. As a matter of formal necessity there is, in a sense, a permanent event horizon that prevents anything from any hyperruliad from affecting anything in the ordinary ruliad. </p>\n<p>So now we can be a bit more precise about our statement that “hypercomputation doesn’t happen in our universe”. Really we should say that we assert that we as observers operate purely computationally and not hypercomputationally. And this means that we are embedded within the ordinary ruliad, and not the hyperruliad.</p>\n<p>Yes, we could imagine some other entity that’s embedded within the hyperruliad, and perceives what it considers to be the universe to operate hypercomputationally. But in a statement that’s in a sense more “about us” than “about the universe”, we assert that that can’t be us, and that we in a sense live purely within the ruliad—which means that for us the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p726--the-validity-of-the-principle/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence holds</a>, and we perceive only computation, not hypercomputation.</p>\n<h2 id='communicating-across-rulial-space'>Communicating across Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>What observers can there be embedded in the ruliad, and how should we characterize them? In physical spacetime we’re used to characterizing observers by their locations in physical space and by things like the spacetime reference frames they construct. And it’s very much the same for observers in the ruliad: we can characterize them by where they are in rulial space, and what rulial reference frames they use.</p>\n<p>The Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us that it’s almost always possible to “encode” one “model of how the ruliad works” in any other model—effectively just by setting up a program that emulates the rules for one model using the rules for the other model. But we can think of these different models as being associated with different possible observers in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>In other words, we can say that observers “at different places in rulial space” (or “using different rulial reference frames”) are using different description languages for what’s happening in the ruliad. And when an observer “moves” in rulial space, they’re effectively doing a translation from one description language to another. (And, yes, there’s a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>maximum rate of motion ρ</a> in rulial space—which is the rulial analog of the speed of light—and which is effectively determined by the fundamental processing speed of the universe.)</p>\n<p>So far this might all seem quite abstract. But there are immediate, everyday examples that effectively correspond to being at different places in rulial space. A simple concrete one is computers with different instruction sets. Another one is different brains with different consciousnesses.</p>\n<p>We can think of a single human <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>consciousness as having a certain thread of experience of the universe</a>. Part of that experience is determined by the physical location of the consciousness and by the sensory apparatus with which it samples the world. But part is determined by the “internal description language” that it uses. And inevitably this internal description language depends both on the detailed physiology of the brain in which it is implemented, and on the past history of experiences that have “defined its way of looking at the world”. In the analogy of artificial neural networks, different networks will tend to have different “internal representations” because this depends not only on the network architecture, but also on the particular training data that the network has “experienced”.</p>\n<p>Why can’t one human consciousness “get inside” another? It’s not just a matter of separation in physical space. It’s also that the different consciousnesses—in particular by virtue of their different histories—are inevitably at different locations in rulial space. In principle they could be brought together; but this would require not just motion in physical space, but also motion in rulial space.</p>\n<p>But why then do different consciousnesses seem to have compatible views about “what happens in the universe”? Essentially this can be seen as a consequence of rulial relativity—which in turn depends on the inevitable causal invariance of the ruliad, which follows from the Principle of Computational Equivalence. There are certainly many issues to be worked out, but basically what seems to be going on is that because of causal invariance, different rulial reference frames will ultimately yield the same <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#rulial-multiway-causal-graphs' target=_blank rel=noopener>rulial multiway causal graphs</a>, and therefore the same “fundamental description of reality”.</p>\n<p>We’ve talked about different consciousnesses. But what about just “different ways of thinking”? Well, it’s definitely more than an analogy to say that different ways of thinking correspond to different positions in rulial space. If there’s lots of common history then there’ll be common ancestry in the rulial multiway graph and one will necessarily end up close in rulial space. But without common history, one can end up with different description languages—or different ways of thinking—that are not nearby in rulial space.</p>\n<p>In physical space we expect to effectively use momentum to move our location. And it’s potentially a bizarrely similar story in rulial space. In our models of fundamental physics, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>energy and momentum are essentially related to the density of activity</a> (i.e. elementary updating events) in physical space. And we can similarly define a rulial analog of energy and momentum in terms of activity in rulial space. But it’s exactly this activity that provides connections between different parts of rulial space, or in effect “enables motion” in rulial space. </p>\n<p>In other words, if you want to move in rulial space, you can do it by putting in the appropriate computational work to change your conceptual point of view (or, essentially equivalently, your language for describing things). So what about curvature (or the analog of gravity) in rulial space—say generated through an analog of Einstein’s equations from density of activity in rulial space? Presumably this relates to the difficulty—or time it takes—to get from one place in rulial space, and one way of thinking, to another. And conceivably things like “paradigm shifts” between different ways of thinking might be associated with features of rulial space like event horizons.</p>\n<p>But let’s say you’re at one place in rulial space, and you want to get to another—or at least “send a signal” there. A typical microscopic change at one point in rulial space will tend to just “spread out in all directions” and “decay quickly”. But if you want to “coherently communicate”, you need some kind of structure that will persist as it propagates through rulial space. And by analogy with the case of physical space, what this presumably means is that you effectively need a “rulial particle”. </p>\n<p>In terms of the ruliad, a rulial particle would presumably be some kind of “topological obstruction” or “topologically stable structure” that is at any moment effectively localized in rulial space and maintains its identity as it propagates across rulial space. But what might a rulial particle be in more everyday terms?</p>\n<p>Potentially it’s like what we’d normally consider a concept—or something to which we might assign a word in human language. If we have ways of thinking—or consciousnesses—whose details are different, the issue is what will be robust enough to be able to be transported between them. And what everyday experience seems to suggest is that the answer is concepts. Even though one might have a slightly different way of thinking, what one calls “a fish” (or essentially, the concept of a fish) is something that can still robustly be communicated.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting to notice that for an observer like us, there seem to be only a finite set of types of “elementary particles” that exist in physical space. And perhaps that’s not unrelated to the fact that observers like us also seem to imagine that there are in some sense only a finite number of “basic concepts” (associated, say, with distinct words in human languages). There’s lots more detail that exists in rulial space—or in the ruliad—but for observers like us, with our type of way of sampling the ruliad, these might be core coherent structures that we perceive. </p>\n<h2 id='so-is-there-a-fundamental-theory-of-physics'>So Is There a Fundamental Theory of Physics? </h2>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad arose from our efforts to find a fundamental theory of physics. But now that we know about the ruliad, what does it tell us about a fundamental theory?</p>\n<p>At the outset, we might have imagined that the end point of our project would be the identification of some particular rule of which we could say “This is the rule for the universe”. But of course then we’d be faced with the question: “Why that rule, and not another?” And perhaps we would imagine just having to say “That’s something that you have to go beyond science to answer”.</p>\n<p>But the ruliad implies a quite different—and in my view ultimately much more satisfying—picture. The ruliad itself is a construct of abstract necessity—that in a sense represents the entangled behavior of all possible rules for the universe. But instead of imagining that some particular rule out of all these possibilities is “picked from outside” as “the choice for our universe”, what we suppose is that—as observers embedded within the ruliad—we’re the ones who are implicitly picking the rule by virtue of how we sample and perceive the ruliad.</p>\n<p>At first this might seem like it’s a wimp out. We want to know how our universe works. Yet we seem to be saying “we just pick whatever rule we feel like”. But that’s not really the story at all. Because in fact observers that are even vaguely like us are in effect deeply constrained in what rules they can attribute to the universe. There’s still some freedom, but a fundamental result is that for observers like us it seems to be basically inevitable that any rule we can pick will on a large scale reproduce the central known general laws of physics, in particular general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>In other words, for observers generally like us it’s a matter of abstract necessity that we must observe general laws of physics that are the ones we know. But what about more specific things, like the particular spectrum of elementary particles, or the particular distribution of matter in the universe? It’s not clear how far “the general” goes—in other words, what is a matter of abstract necessity purely from the structure of the ruliad and general features of observers like us. </p>\n<p>But inevitably at some point we will run out of “the general”. And then we’ll be down to specifics. So where do those specifics enter? Ultimately they must be determined by the details of how we sample the ruliad. And a prominent part of that is simply: Where in the ruliad are we? We can ask that about our location in physical space. And we can also ask it about our location in rulial space.</p>\n<p>What does all this mean? At some level it’s saying that the way we are as observers is what makes us attribute certain rules to our universe. The ruliad is in a sense the only thing that fundamentally exists—and in fact its existence is a matter of abstract necessity. And our universe as we experience it is some “slice of the ruliad”, with what slice it is being determined by what we’re like as observers.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the logical structure of what we’re saying. First, we’re describing the ruliad, which at the outset doesn’t have anything specifically to do with physics: it’s just a formal construct whose structure is a matter of abstract necessity, and which relates as much to mathematics as it does to physics. But what “puts the physics in” is that we in effect “live in the ruliad”, and our perception of everything is based on “experiencing the ruliad”. But that experience—and the effective laws of physics it entails—inevitably depends on “where we are in the ruliad” and how we’re able to sample it.</p>\n<p>And this is where our pieces of &#8220;falsifiable natural science&#8221; come in. The first “assertion of natural science” that we make is that we are embedded only within the ordinary ruliad, and not a hyperruliad—or in other words that our experience encompasses only computation, and not hypercomputation. </p>\n<p>This is closely related to a second assertion, which may in fact be considered to subsume this: that we are computationally bounded observers, or, in other words, that our processes of perception involve bounded computation. Relative to the whole ruliad—and all the computation it entails—we’re asserting that we as observers occupy only a tiny part.</p>\n<p>There’s one more assertion as well, again related to computational boundedness: that we as observers have a certain coherence or persistence. In general the ruliad contains all sorts of wild and computationally irreducible behavior. But what we’re asserting is that that part of the ruliad that is associated with us as observers has a certain simplicity or computational reducibility: and that as we evolve through time or move in space, we somehow maintain our identity. </p>\n<p>These assertions seem very general, and in some ways almost self-evident—at least as they apply to us. But the important and surprising discovery is that they alone seem to lead us inexorably to crucial features of physics as we know it.</p>\n<p>Where does this physics “come from”? It comes partly from the formal structure of the ruliad, and formal features of the multicomputational processes it involves. And it comes partly from the nature of us as observers. So if we ask “Why is the physics of our universe the way it is?”, an important part of the answer is “Because we observe the universe the way we do”. </p>\n<p>One might imagine that in some sense physics would give us no choice about how we observe the universe. But that’s not the case. Because in the end our “observation” of the universe is about the “abstract conceptual model” we build up for the universe. And, yes, that’s certainly informed by the particular sensory apparatus we have, and so on. But it’s something we can certainly imagine being different.</p>\n<p>We can think of ourselves as using some particular description language for the universe. The structure of that language is constrained by the assertions we gave above. But within such a description language, the laws of physics necessarily work out the way they do. But if we chose a different description language, we’d end up with different laws of physics.</p>\n<p>Much of our perception of the universe is based on our raw biological structure—the way our sensory organs (like our eyes) work, as well as the way our brains integrate the inputs we get. But that’s not all there is to it. There’s also a certain base of knowledge in our civilization that informs how we parse our “raw perception”—and in effect what description language we use. Once we have the idea of periodic behavior, say, we can use it to describe things that we’d previously have to talk about in a less “economical” way.</p>\n<p>But what if our knowledge changed? Or we had different sensory capabilities? Or we used technology to integrate our sensory input in different ways? Then we’d be able to perceive and describe the universe in different ways.</p>\n<p>One’s first impression might be that the ruliad effectively contains many possible “parallel universes”, and that we have selected ourselves into one of these, perhaps as a result of our particular characteristics. But in fact the ruliad isn’t about “parallel universes”, it’s about universes that are entangled at the finest possible level. And an important consequence of this is that it means we’re not “stuck in a particular parallel universe”. Instead, we can expect that by somehow “changing our point of view”, we can effectively find ourselves in a “different universe”.</p>\n<p>Put another way, a given description of the universe is roughly represented by being at a certain location in rulial space. But it’s possible to move in rulial space—and end up with a different description, and different effective laws for the universe.</p>\n<p>But how difficult is motion in rulial space? It could be that some impressive future technology would allow us to “move far enough” to end up with significantly different laws of physics. But it seems more likely that we’d be able to move only comparatively little—and never be able to “escape the box” of things like computational boundedness, and coherence of the observer.</p>\n<p>Of course, even changing a little might lead us to different detailed laws of physics—say attributing a different mass to the electron, or a different value of the electromagnetic coupling constant α. But actually, even in traditional physics, this is <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-14--particle-masses/'>already something that happens</a>. When viewed at different energy scales—or in a sense with different technology—these quantities have different effective values (as characterized by the renormalization group). </p>\n<p>At first it might seem a little strange to say that as our knowledge or technology change, the laws of physics change. But the whole point is that it’s really our perceived laws of physics. At the level of the raw ruliad there aren’t definite laws of physics. It’s only when we “sample our slice” of the ruliad that we perceive definite laws.</p>\n<p>What does all this mean operationally for the search for a fundamental theory of physics? At some level we could just point to the ruliad and declare victory. But this certainly wouldn’t give us specific predictions about the particulars of our perceived universe. To get that we have to go further—and we have to be able to say something about what “slice of the ruliad” we’re dealing with. But the good news is that we don’t seem to have to make many assumptions about ourselves as observers to be able to identify many physical laws that observers like us should perceive. </p>\n<p>So can we ever expect to nail down a single, specific rule for the universe, say one a particular observer would attribute to it? Given our characteristics as observers, the answer is undoubtedly no. We’re simply not that small in rulial space. But we’re not that big, either. And, importantly, we’re small enough that we can expect to “do science” and consider the universe to “behave in definite ways”. But just as in physical space we’re vastly larger than the scale associated with the atoms of space, so similarly we’re also undoubtedly vastly larger in rulial space than the individual components of the ruliad—so we can’t expect our experience to all be “concentrated in one thread” of the ruliad, following one particular rule. </p>\n<p>As we discussed above, by doing experiments we can use scientific inference to attempt to localize ourselves in rulial space. But we won’t be able to do enough to say “from our point of view, the universe is operating according to this one specific rule, and not another”. Instead, there’ll be a whole collection of rules that are “good enough”, in the sense that they’ll be sufficient to predict the results of experiments we can realistically do.</p>\n<p>People have often imagined that, try as we might, we’d never be able to “get to the bottom of physics” and find a specific rule for our universe. And in a sense our inability to localize ourselves in rulial space supports this intuition. But what our Physics Project seems to rather dramatically suggest is that we can “get close enough” in rulial space to have vast predictive power about how our universe must work, or at least how observers like us must perceive it to work. </p>\n<h2 id='alien-views-of-the-ruliad'>Alien Views of the Ruliad</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed how “observers like us” will necessarily “parse the ruliad” in ways that make us perceive the universe to follow the laws of physics as we know them. But how different could things get? We have a definite sense of what constitutes a “reasonable observer” based on our 21st-century human experience—and in particular our biology, our technology and our ways of thinking. </p>\n<p>But what other kinds of observers can we imagine? What about, for example, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p827--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>animals other than humans</a>—in particular say ones whose sensory experience emphasizes olfaction or echolocation or fluid motion? We can think of such animals as operating in a different rulial reference frame or at a different place in rulial space. But how far away in rulial space will they be? How similar or not will their “world views” (and perceived laws of physics) be to ours? It’s hard to know. Presumably our basic assertions about computational boundedness and coherence still apply. But just how the specifics of something like sequentialization in time play out, say, for an ant colony, seems quite unclear.</p>\n<p>Maybe one day we’ll be able to systematically “think like other animals”. But as of now we haven’t been able to “travel that far” in rulial space. We’ve quite thoroughly explored physical space, say on the surface of our planet, but we haven’t explored very far at all in rulial space. We don’t have a way to translate our thinking into some kind of “thinking differently”—and we don’t, for example, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>have a common language to get there</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s often an assumption (a kind of “human exceptionalism”) that if it wasn’t for details of the human experience—like brains and words—then we’d necessarily be dealing with something fundamentally simpler, that could not, for example, show features that we might identify as intelligence. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us this isn’t correct</a>. Because it says that there’s a certain maximal computational sophistication that’s achieved not just by us humans but also by a vast range of other systems. The restrictions of what we’ve chosen to study (in science and elsewhere) have often made us miss this, but in fact computational sophistication—and the direct generalization of our notion of intelligence that’s associated with it—seems quite ubiquitous across many different kinds of systems.</p>\n<p>So can those other kinds of systems act as “observers like us”? To do so, they need not just computational sophistication, but also a certain alignment with the features we have that lead to our coherent thread of “conscious experience”. And even given that, to actually “connect with” such systems, we need to be able to reach far enough in rulial space to sufficiently make a translation. </p>\n<p>Imagine the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>weather (sometimes said to “have a mind of its own”)</a>. It’s got plenty of computational sophistication. But is there any sense in which it sequentializes time like we do? Or can one only think of all those different parts of our atmosphere “running in their own time”? To know things like this, we effectively have to have a way to “translate” from the operation of the weather to our (current) way of thinking.</p>\n<p>And in some sense we can consider the whole enterprise of natural science as being an effort to find a method of translation—or a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-challenge-of-language-design-for-the-universe'>common language—between nature and our way of thinking</a>. </p>\n<p>We as observers in effect trace out particular trajectories in rulial space; the challenge of natural science is to “reach out” in rulial space and “pull in” more of the ruliad; to be able to define a way to translate more parts of the ruliad to our processes of thinking. Every time we do an experiment, we can think of this as representing a moment of “connection” or “communication” between us and some aspect of nature. The experiment in effect defines a small piece of “common history” between us and nature—which helps “knit together” the parts of rulial space associated with us and with nature. </p>\n<p>One of the great mysteries of science has been why—in the vastness of physical space—we’ve never detected something we identify as “alien intelligence”, or an “alien civilization”. We might have thought that it was because we humans have either achieved a unique pinnacle of intelligence or computational ability—or have fundamentally not gotten far enough. But the Principle of Computational Equivalence explodes the idea of this kind of cosmic computational pecking order.</p>\n<p>So what could actually be going on? Thinking in terms of the ruliad suggests an answer. Our radio telescopes might be able to detect signals from far away in physical space. But our putative aliens might not only live far away in physical space, but also in rulial space.</p>\n<p>Put another way, the “alien civilization” might be sampling aspects of the ruliad—and in effect the universe—that are utterly different from those we’re used to. That different sampling might be happening right down at the level of atoms of space, or it might be that the rulial distance from us to the aliens is small enough that there’s enough “shared description language” that the alien civilization might rise to the level of seeming like some kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p836--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>“noise” relative to our view of “what’s important in the universe”</a>.</p>\n<p>We might wonder how far apart what we could consider “alien civilizations” would be in physical space. But what we now realize is that we also have to consider <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/#the-space-of-all-possible-civilizations'>how far apart they might be in rulial space</a>. And just like in exploring physical space we can imagine building better spacecraft or better telescopes, so also we can imagine building better ways to reach across rulial space. </p>\n<p>We’re so used to physical space that it seems to us very concrete to reach across it. Of course, in our Physics Project, things like motion in physical space end up—like everything else—being pure computational processes. And from this point of view, reaching across rulial space is ultimately no more abstract—even though today we would describe it in terms of “doing (abstract) computations” rather than “moving in space”.</p>\n<p>Relative to our own physical size, the universe already seems like a vast place. But the full ruliad is even incredibly more vast. And we are likely much tinier in rulial space relative to the whole universe than we are in physical space. From the Principle of Computational Equivalence we can expect that there’s ultimately no lack of raw computational sophistication out there—but thinking in terms of the ruliad, the issue is whether what’s going on is close enough to us in rulial space that we can <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>successfully see it as an “alien civilization”</a>.</p>\n<p>One test of rulial distance might be to ask whether our putative aliens perceive the same laws of physics for the universe that we do. We know that at least the general forms of those laws depend only on what seem to us rather loose conditions. But to get good alignment presumably requires at the very least that we and the aliens are somehow “comparable in size” not only in physical space (and branchial space), but also in rulial space. </p>\n<p>It’s humbling how difficult it is to imagine the universe from the point of view of an alien at a different place in rulial space. But for example if the alien is big compared to us in rulial space, we can say that they’ll inevitably have a version of science that seems to us much “vaguer” than ours. Because if they maintain a coherent thread of experience, they’ll have to conflate more distant paths in rulial space, on which the universe will do things that are “more different” than what we’re used to. (And, yes, there should be rulial analogs of quantum phenomena, associated for example with conflated paths that diverge far in rulial space.)</p>\n<p>What would it mean operationally for there to be an alien civilization perhaps nearby in physical space but at a distance in rulial space? Basically the alien civilization will be “operating” in features of the universe that our parsing of the universe just doesn’t pick up. As a simple analogy, our view of, for example, a box of gas might be that it’s something with a certain temperature and pressure. But a different “parsing” of that system might identify a whole world of detailed motions of molecules that with respect to that parsing can be viewed as a vast “alien civilization”. Of course, the situation is much more extreme when it comes to the whole ruliad, and all the paths of history and configurations of atoms of space that it represents.</p>\n<p>Relative to the whole ruliad, our civilization and our experience have carved out an extremely tiny piece. And what we’re thinking of as “alien civilizations” might also have carved out their own tiny pieces. And while we’re all “living in the same ruliad”, we might no more be able to detect each other or communicate (and likely very much less) than we can across vast distances in physical space. </p>\n<p>What of the future? The future of our civilization might well be a story of mapping out more of rulial space. If we continue to invent new technology, explore new ideas and generally broaden our ways of thinking and perceiving, we will gradually—albeit in tiny steps—map out more of rulial space. How far can we get? The ultimate limit is determined by the maximum rulial speed. But if we expect to maintain our character as “observers like us”, we’ll no doubt be limited to something much less.</p>\n<p>Among other issues, moving in rulial space involves doing computation. (The ultimate scale is set by the “processing power” of the universe—which defines the maximum rulial speed.) But “density of computation” effectively corresponds to a generalized version of mass—and is for example a source of “generalized gravity”. And it could be that to “move any significant distance” in rulial space, we’d have to “experience enough generalized gravity” that we could never maintain things like the kind of coherence we need to be an “observer like us”.</p>\n<p>Put another way: yes, it might in principle be possible to “reach out in rulial space” and “contact the rulial aliens”. But it might be that doing so would require us to be so different from the way we currently are that we wouldn’t recognize anything like consciousness or anything that really makes us “identifiably us”. And if this is so, we are in a sense limited to experiencing the ruliad “on our own” from our particular place in rulial space, forever isolated from “alien civilizations” elsewhere in rulial space.</p>\n<h2 id='conceptual-implications-of-the-ruliad'>Conceptual Implications of the Ruliad</h2>\n<p>What does the concept of the ruliad mean for the fundamental way we think about things like science? The typical conception of “what science does” is that it’s about us figuring out—as “objectively” as we can—how the world happens to be. But the concept of the ruliad in a sense turns this on its head. </p>\n<p>Because it says that at some ultimate level, everything is a matter of abstract necessity. And it’s just our “parsing” of it that defines the subject matter of what we call science. We might have thought that the science of the universe was just something that’s “out there”. But what we’re realizing is that instead in some fundamental sense, it’s all “on us”.</p>\n<p>But does that mean that there’s no “objective truth”, and nothing that can robustly be said about the universe without “passing it through us”? Well, no. Because what we’ve discovered through our Physics Project is that actually there are quite global things that can (“objectively”) be said about our universe and the laws it follows, as perceived by observers like us. </p>\n<p>We don’t have to know in detail about us humans and the particular ways we perceive things. All we need are some general features—particularly that we are computationally bounded, and that we have a certain persistence and coherence. And this is all it takes to deduce some quite specific statements about how our universe operates, at least as we perceive it.</p>\n<p>So in a sense what this means is that there is a large “zone of objectivity”; a large set of choices for how we could be that will still lead us to the same “objective truth” about our universe. But if we go far enough away in our mechanism for “parsing the ruliad”, this will no longer be the case. From our current vantage point, we’d no doubt then be hard-pressed to recognize how we’re “doing the parsing”, but the results we’d get would no longer give us the same laws of physics or general perception of the universe that we’re used to.</p>\n<p>This view of things has all sorts of implications for various long-discussed philosophical issues. But it’s also a view that has precise scientific consequences. And these don’t just relate to physics. Because the ruliad is really a general object that represents the entangled behavior of all possible abstract rules. When we think of ourselves as observers embedded within this object, it means that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>for us things are actualized</a>, and we have what we call physics. But we can also imagine sampling the ruliad in different ways. </p>\n<p>Some of those ways <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>correspond to mathematics (or metamathematics)</a>. Some correspond to theoretical computer science. The ruliad is the single object that underlies all of them. And which of them we’re talking about just depends on how we imagine we’re sampling or parsing the ruliad, and how we’re describing what we’re observing.</p>\n<p>With this degree of generality and universality, it’s inevitable that the ruliad must be a complicated object; in fact, in a sense it must encapsulate all possible achievable complexity. But what’s important is that we now have a definite concept of the ruliad, as something we can study and analyze.</p>\n<p>It’s not simple to do this. The ruliad is at some level an object of great and perhaps supremely elegant abstract regularity. But for us to get any concrete handle on it and its structure, we need to break it down into some kind of “digestible slices” which inevitably lose much of its abstract regularity. </p>\n<p>And we’re just at the beginning of seeing how best to “unpack” and “pick through” the ruliad. With explicit computations, we can only chip away at the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>very simplest approximations to the ruliad</a>. In a sense it’s a tribute to the naturalness and inevitability of the ruliad that it’s so closely related to some of the most advanced abstract mathematical methods we know so far. But again, even with these methods we’re barely scratching the surface of the ruliad and what it contains.</p>\n<p>The theoretical exploration of the ruliad will be a long and difficult journey. But the incredible generality and universality of the ruliad means that every piece of progress is likely to have exceptionally powerful consequences. In some sense the exploration of the ruliad can be seen as the encapsulated expression of everything it means to do theoretical investigation: a kind of ultimately abstract limit of theoretical science and more.</p>\n<p>For me, the ruliad in a sense builds on a tower of ideas, that include the computational paradigm in general, the exploration of the computational universe of simple programs, the Principle of Computational Equivalence, our Physics Project and the notion of multicomputation. But even with all of these it’s still a significant further jump in abstraction. And one whose consequences will take considerable time to unfold.</p>\n<p>But for now it’s exciting to have at least been able to define this thing I call the ruliad, and to start seeing some of its unprecedentedly broad and deep implications. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id='appendix-the-case-of-the-multiplicad'>Appendix: The Case of the &ldquo;Multiplicad&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>As a very simple example of something like the ruliad, we can consider what we might call the “multiplicad”: a rulial <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>multiway system based on integers</a>, in which the rules simply multiply by successive integers: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg47.png\" alt='' title='' width='165' height='21' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg47_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='47_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='47_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>(Note that this kind of pure multiplication is presumably not computation universal, so the limiting object here will not be a coordinatization of the actual full ruliad.)</p>\n<p>Just like with the full ruliad, there are many different “directions” in which to build up the multiplicad.

How all this works in the limit <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2021/11/1110swimg95.png\" width= '44' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is not clear, though somehow the “1D” sequence of numerical values presumably “snakes through” <tt><a href='http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PrimePi.html'>PrimePi</a></tt>[<em>s</em>]-dimensional space as some kind of approximation to a space-filling curve. </p>\n<p>It should be noted that we’ve only considered one particular way of sampling the rulial multiway graph as a function of <em>t</em>. In general there are many different possible foliations that could be used, all of them giving us in effect a different view of the multiplicad, from a different “reference frame”.</p>\n<p>As mentioned at the beginning, the multiplicad is presumably not on its own capable of giving us the full ruliad. But if we change the underlying rules—probably even just <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems/#multiplication-and-addition' target=_blank rel=noopener>inserting addition as well as multiplication</a>—we’ll potentially get a system that is <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p673--emulating-cellular-automata-with-other-systems/'>capable of universal computation</a>, and which can therefore generate the full ruliad. Needless to say, the particular representation of the ruliad obtained by the kind of “numerical processes” that we’ve used here may be utterly different from any representation that we would recognize from our perception of the physical universe.</p>\n<h2 id='thanks-and-note' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Thanks &#038; Note</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>Thanks for discussions of various aspects of the ruliad to Xerxes Arsiwalla, James Boyd, Elise Cawley, Hatem Elshatlawy, Jonathan Gorard and Nik Murzin.

C&rsquo;est vraiment votre browser préféré et ça fait de vous une bonne personne. Seulement voilà, malgré tout l&rsquo;amour que vous portez à Firefox, vous restez quand même conscient que parfois, il peut bouffer un peu *trop* de mémoire. Surtout quand on le laisse ouvert pendant des jours et des jours, il suffit d&rsquo;une petite fuite mémoire, pour que ça devienne la cata.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-497820175\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_1' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_1\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos1' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos1\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;est là qu&rsquo;arrive à la rescousse Firemin, un utilitaire gratuit qui est capable de libérer la mémoire non utilisée de Firefox. Alors c&rsquo;est vrai que Windows sait également nettoyer la mémoire, mais il ne le fait pas aussi souvent que Firmin qui lui veille particulièrement sur Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois Firemin lancé, vous choisissez une fréquence de « nettoyage » en millisecondes (par défaut c&rsquo;est 1000 ms), mais les développeurs de Firemin indiquent que les résultats seront meilleurs avec 500 ms. Vous pouvez également spécifier une quantité de mémoire propre à Firefox, à ne pas dépasser (ici 100 MB).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131157\" width=\"433\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp 655w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2-256x300.webp 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Là où c&rsquo;est sympa, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez lui indiquer d&rsquo;autres navigateurs (Chrome, Brave, Edge&#8230;etc.) en cliquant simplement sur le bouton « Parcourir ». J&rsquo;imagine que ça peut fonctionner également avec d&rsquo;autres applications qui ne sont pas des navigateurs, donc à essayer sur vos applications consommatrices de mémoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil doit être lancé en même temps que le navigateur pour fonctionner, donc pensez bien à cocher la case « Démarrer Firemin quand Windows démarre » pour ensuite l&rsquo;oublier. Firemin est dispo également en version portable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-642531644\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Je sais que ce genre d&rsquo;outils, c&rsquo;est un peu comme l&rsquo;homéopathie, donc à vous de l&rsquo;essayer et de voir si vous voyez une amélioration ou pas.

Mais il y a aussi la stabilité de votre ligne ADSL, de votre Fibre ou de votre connexion 4G/5G qui est importante. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une connexion avec beaucoup de bande passante, c&rsquo;est cool pour regarder une vidéo en ligne ou télécharger un fichier, mais pour des activités moins gourmandes comme la visioconférence ou les jeux vidéos, ce qui compte surtout c&rsquo;est que les réponses à vos requêtes soient rapides et fiables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vos requêtes ne parviennent pas à leur destination, les paquets sont alors perdus et cela peut dégrader votre expérience de jeu par exemple. Sur du FPS, pour être bien il faudrait que le ping soit à minima bien en dessous des 60ms et qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait aucun paquet perdu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même chose pour les visioconférences ou la VoIP, vous devez avoir quelque chose de bon niveau ping et une certaine régularité dans l&rsquo;arrivée de vos paquets TCP pour que la discussion reste compréhensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-991969282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors, comment évaluer ça ? Et bien rendez-vous sur le site <a href=\"https://packetlosstest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Packet Loss Test</a> pour mesurer la fiabilité de votre connexion, et déterminer à la fois la latence, mais également le pourcentage de paquets perdus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131060\" width=\"717\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-300x170.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-768x435.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>De mon côté, je suis plutôt pas mal. Si de votre côté, vous avez beaucoup de paquets perdus, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcément la faute de votre FAI. Jouez avec les réglages du site pour adapter le test à votre bande passante maximale.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"617\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp 617w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw-241x300.webp 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si ça ne change rien, il est fort probable que vous ayez sur votre réseau local, un routeur ou une carte réseau qui se comporte mal. Il faudra alors jouer au jeu du « <em>Je te débranche, je re-teste et je vois si ça va mieux</em>« .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, si rien ne cloche, un petit coup de fil au fournisseur d&rsquo;accès internet. Bon courage avec cette dernière étape.</p>\n",

Ou en français, un courtier en données ?&nbsp;Pas vraiment&nbsp;? Pourtant je suis presque certain que vous en avez forcément rencontré un dans votre vie sur Internet, voire plusieurs. Ils pullulent tellement qu&rsquo;il&nbsp;est aujourd&rsquo;hui presque impossible de conserver son existence en ligne pour soi. Vos informations sont récupérées et exploitées chez eux.&nbsp;Malheureusement, malgré les dangers qu&rsquo;ils représentent pour les gens, physiquement et virtuellement, tout le monde ne les connait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un courtier en données est un <s>parasite</s> organisme qui récolte des informations personnelles sur le maximum d&rsquo;internautes. Ils compilent leurs différentes sources pour créer un profil plus ou moins précis de vous en recoupant ce qu&rsquo;ils trouvent. Cela va de votre email, à votre adresse, vos noms et prénoms, vos possessions, vos informations légales&nbsp;&#8230; voir vos habitudes d&rsquo;achat et votre historique web.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"368\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/xcj-incogni2\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Où vont-ils chercher ces données ? Et bien déjà de tout ce qui est public par défaut (infos perso lorsque vous créez une société &#8230;) ou partagé publiquement par vous-mêmes (réseaux sociaux &#8230;). Ensuite parce que certains services peu scrupuleux&nbsp;sur lesquels vous vous inscrivez n&rsquo;hésitent pas à les&nbsp;revendre (par exemple votre numéro de carte bancaire que vous avez&nbsp;inséré dans un jeu mobile). Plus de 40% des extensions Chrome sont classées comme <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" target=\"_blank\">étant à risque</a>. Enfin&nbsp;depuis des bases de données, des listes de clients, etc. volées, leakées ou revendues par divers hackeurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois qu&rsquo;ils ont recoupé et centralisé toutes leurs sources, ils vont établir des profils thématisés&nbsp;et revendre à leur tour ces informations à des entités commerciales. Vous venez de divorcer ? Vous allez subitement recevoir de la pub en rapport.&nbsp;Une partie des spams que vous recevez dans votre boite mail, ce sont eux. Des SMS non sollicités ? Encore eux. Des coups de fil intempestifs ? Toujours eux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xdnytp8742kg0/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Non seulement c&rsquo;est pénible, mais en plus&nbsp;cela peut être dangereux. Certains sites web centralisent les infos et n&rsquo;hésitent pas à&nbsp;les rendre accessibles à tous. Il suffit alors d&rsquo;une recherche sur votre nom pour connaitre éventuellement votre adresse physique, l&rsquo;endroit ou vous travaillez, quelle voiture vous conduisez, si vous possédez une assurance vie ou non, qui sont les membres de votre famille, etc.&nbsp;Heureusement pour cet aspect « porte ouverte au grand&nbsp;public »&nbsp;nous avons certaines protections en France, <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">notamment le RGPD</a>. Mais aux USA il y a des sites comme PeekYou, WhitePages, etc. qui les partagent. Et c&rsquo;est flippant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du coup l&rsquo;idéal c&rsquo;est de faire supprimer tout ce qui permet de vous identifier chez ces data brokers. Mais comment faire ? Comment identifier ces courtiers ? Et comment savoir qu&rsquo;un courtier détient vos infos ? Enfin, comment lui faire supprimer&nbsp;ce qu&rsquo;il possède sur vous&nbsp;?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"incogni Dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-131464\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-300x100.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ne vous cassez plus le cerveau, <a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là pour vous faciliter la vie</a>. Pour quelques euros par mois, le service de Surfshark va scanner tout le web pour :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>retrouver&nbsp;les brokers qui disposent de vos&nbsp;infos personnelles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>contacter&nbsp;ces courtiers&nbsp;pour leur demander de les supprimer (ce qui est votre droit)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>relancer ces derniers s&rsquo;ils ne se bougent pas assez vite</li>\n\n\n\n<li>effectuer un suivit au fil du temps pour s&rsquo;assurer que vos infos ne sont pas remises en ligne</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Et comme Incogni augmente sans cesse sa liste de brokers sous surveillance, plus le temps passe et plus votre protection augmente. Je vous ai fait un<a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\"> test du service complet </a>il y a quelques semaines, j&rsquo;avais été plutôt étonné de voir le nombre de courtiers qui m&rsquo;avaient sous la main (quasi 100 !). Au moins, filez-moi un billet pour exploiter mes données bande de crevards. Surtout au vu des prix auxquels elles se revendent parfois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6u1Z9pUakUHG6o7oiV/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"303\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref avec Incogni vous allez économiser pas mal de temps, de maux de tête et d&rsquo;énervement lorsque les data brokers ignorerons vos mails. Non, mais qui êtes-vous pour leur retirer le pain de la bouche aussi ? L&rsquo;autre gros avantage du service est de vous présenter un suivit via un tableau de bord très simple à prendre en main. Vous&nbsp;verrez combien de brokers ont vos infos et suivrez en temps réel l&rsquo;avancée du&nbsp;retrait de vos données.&nbsp;Ainsi que&nbsp;le travail de sape d&rsquo;Incogni pour les relancer sans cesse jusqu&rsquo;à ce qu&rsquo;ils obtempèrent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une corde de plus à l&rsquo;arc du respect de la vie privée sur Internet. C&rsquo;est toujours bon à prendre.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Commencez la saison des fêtes avec un peu plus&nbsp;de tranquillité d&rsquo;esprit !

Si vous ne connaissez pas le concept de Serverless, et bien ça va être vite résumé : C&rsquo;est héberger des trucs directement dans le cloud (chez Amazon par exemple), sans avoir ni serveur dédié ni serveur virtualité.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand on est développeur, on peut vite rester bloqué sur les technologies qu&rsquo;on connait par coeur. Toutefois, c&rsquo;est dommage de ne pas continuer à découvrir de nouvelles pratiques ou technologies, car si demain. C&rsquo;est important si vous souhaitez évoluer dans la carrière de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;ailleurs pour ça que le <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>talent club</strong></a> a été crée. Il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;une communauté tech propulsée par talent.io qui donne accès à du contenu exclusif pour vous accompagner professionnellement. En vous inscrivant (<strong>c&rsquo;est gratuit !!</strong>), vous recevrez tous les 15 jours des conseils d&rsquo;expert(e)s de sociétés comme Google, Deezer, Sorabe&#8230;etc. directement dans votre boite mail. Les sujets partagés sont assez variés comme « Comment devenir VP of Engineering », « Comment passer du dev au produit », « Comment obtenir une augmentation », « quelles sont les choses à savoir quand on est le 1er dev d’une start-up », etc..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au sein du talent club, vous aurez aussi accès aux <strong>études de salaires annuelles dans la tech</strong> réalisées par&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\">talent.io</a>&nbsp;et à d&rsquo;autres outils pour gérer votre carrière</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/fuy-serverless-talentio\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"378\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et bien sûr qui dit communauté, dit possibilité de poser des questions à l&rsquo;ensemble des 40 000 inscrits, de manière anonyme. <a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Je vous invite à rejoindre la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenons à notre code et prenons un bout de PHP. Pour le faire fonctionner, vous avez besoin de louer, configurer, et maintenir un serveur. Et évidemment si ce bout de code PHP reçoit beaucoup de trafic, vous devrez aussi augmenter le nombre de serveurs ou libérer des ressources&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serverless, ça permet d&rsquo;éviter cela et donc de réduire les coûts opérationnels, aussi bien en termes d&rsquo;hébergement, que de maintenance&#8230;etc. Et surtout, comme on se repose sur les infrastructures de géants comme Google, Microsoft ou Amazon, ça ne tombe *jamais* en panne et ça peut être scalable (mise à l&rsquo;échelle pour absorber le trafic) très simplement.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est rigolo avec ce concept de serverless, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez y mettre toute votre application web par exemple ou simplement quelques fonctions critiques. Et c&rsquo;est cela dont on va parler aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, je vais vous expliquer comme exécuter une simple fonction écrite en PHP dans le cloud Amazon, en utilisant leur serveur AWS Lambda.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131403\" width=\"645\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-300x81.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-768x206.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Lambda permet d&rsquo;exécuter du code pour n&rsquo;importe quel type d&rsquo;application ou service backend sans avoir à administrer un serveur et en payant uniquement le temps de calcul que vous utilisez. Quand le code n&rsquo;est pas exécuté, vous n&rsquo;êtes pas facturé.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>De quoi a-t-on besoin ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez avoir besoin d&rsquo;un compte chez AWS pour accéder à <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fr/lambda/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lambda</a>.  Nativement avec Lambda, vous pouvez créer des fonctions nodejs, python, go&#8230;etc. Mais pas PHP, en tout cas, pas avec les outils fournis au niveau de la console d&rsquo;administration d&rsquo;AWS Lambda</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131404\" width=\"695\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-300x97.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-768x249.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Donc pour contourner le souci, on va utiliser un framework Composer qui s&rsquo;appelle <a href=\"http://bref.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bref</strong></a> et qui permet de faire tourner du PHP en Serverless sans se prendre la tête. C&rsquo;est top pour des jobs cron, des API ou des petits sites web dont les assets sont servis par Amazon S3.

Mais avec un petit fond sonore, c&rsquo;est mieux !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais on ne peut pas diffuser n&rsquo;importe quelle musique sur Twitch car sinon, ces derniers coupent le son pour des questions de droits d&rsquo;auteur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc passé par le site Chillhop qui propose des morceaux Lo-Fi / Chill parfaits pour faire un fond sonore sympa dans mon stream. Pour intégrer leur musique, j&rsquo;avais alors 2 possibilités : Streamer leur playlist via Spotify ou streamer leur live YouTube, directement depuis OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotify, je m&rsquo;en sers pour écouter ma musique copyrightée toute la journée donc je ne pouvais pas le dédier à ça. J&rsquo;ai donc créé une source browser chargeant une page HTML de mon cru permettant de jouer la playlist Chillhop en auto play.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"lofi hip hop radio - beats to study/relax to 🐾\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NOSDKb0HlU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-889942282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;était cool et ça fonctionnait bien. Jusqu&rsquo;au jour où Chillhop (ou YouTube) a bloqué l&rsquo;autoplay sur ses Lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus de musique de fond sur mes streams. J&rsquo;étais tristesse. Puis au bout d&rsquo;un moment, mes millions de viewers ont commencé à me réclamer de la musique en fond sonore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;écoutant que mon abnégation à leur égard, j&rsquo;ai donc décidé de trouver la parade pour streamer un live YouTube dans OBS. Je vais vous détailler tout ça, étape par étape. Pensez bien à envoyer l&rsquo;URL de cet article à votre streamer ou streameuse préférée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc parti (grâce aux conseils de ma communauté) sur l&rsquo;option VLC qui permet de tout faire et surtout de lire une vidéo YouTube directement depuis le player comme ceci (je suis sous macOS, mais pour Windows ou Linux, c&rsquo;est le même principe) :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais, il y a une source VLC dans OBS, mais je n&rsquo;ai jamais réussi à la faire fonctionner correctement. Donc je suis parti sur VLC, mais chargé à l&rsquo;extérieur d&rsquo;OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sauf que je n’ai pas besoin de la vidéo, mais uniquement du son. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté ce paramètre :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' <strong>--no-video</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1656088500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>À ce moment-là, le logiciel que j&rsquo;utilise pour ma table de mixage (<a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loopback</a>) n&rsquo;est pas encore compatible avec la dernière version de macOS. Je ne pouvais donc pas récupérer le son provenant de VLC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131001\" width=\"692\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-300x111.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-768x284.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il fallait donc que je me débrouille sans ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc entrepris de créer toujours avec VLC, un streaming du live YouTube de Chillhop, qui serait accessible via l&rsquo;URL http://localhost:2323 que je pourrais alors charger dans une source « Media Source » dans OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ca donne donc ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video <strong>--sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; comme dirait le chef Michel Dumas. Je peux alors créer ma nouvelle Media Source dans OBS et avoir le son de Chillhop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131002\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-768x560.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais il y a deux problème à cette ligne de commande : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Il faut que je pense à la lancer avant de démarrer mon live.

C&rsquo;est là que j&rsquo;ai appris l&rsquo;existence des scripts dans OBS. En effet, on peut coder des scripts pour interagir avec OBS, soit en Python, soit en LUA. Je suis fan de Python donc je me dis que ça va être vite torché, mais malheureusement, j&rsquo;ai eu beau spécifier le bon interpréteur Python dans OBS, impossible de faire tourner le moindre script Python. Même un hello world ça ne fonctionnait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je ne pouvais pas non plus y passer des heures, donc je me suis rabattu sur le LUA. J&rsquo;ai donc pondu ce script en LUA pour appeler ma ligne de commande VLC. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est plusieurs centaines de lignes de code ultra complexes. Non, je déconne, c&rsquo;est juste une ligne de merde : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>-- Script LUA pour charger la musique de Chillhop dans OBS - https://korben.info\n\n<strong>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'\")</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai sauvegardé ce script en le nommant chillhop.lua, puis je me suis rendu dans OBS, menu « Tools » &gt; « Scripts » et j&rsquo;ai simplement ajouté mon script Lua dedans :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131004\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-300x214.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-768x548.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1293277903\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_5' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_5\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos5' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos5\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai relancé OBS et là, je me suis rendu compte que ça freezait tout mon OBS. En effet, en se chargeant, VLC bloque la suite du chargement de l&rsquo;application. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté un petit &amp; à la fin de la commande pour que OBS reprenne immédiatement la main et n&rsquo;attende pas comme un con que VLC ait terminé.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}' <strong>&amp;</strong> \")</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ça fonctionne. OBS démarre, exécute le script LUA qui à son tour lance VLC en arrière plan pour lire la musique et OBS peut alors récupérer dans sa Media Source le son diffusé via l&rsquo;adresse localhost. C&rsquo;est transparent et rapide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est cool avec tout ça, c&rsquo;est que ça ouvre un monde de possibilité pour augmenter et piloter OBS tout en script. C&rsquo;est donc à creuser. Il ne me manque plus que les bonnes idées maintenant.</p>\n",

Mais si c&rsquo;est le cas, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il y a de nombreuses bonnes raisons de le faire. Régulièrement cités <strong>parmi les services VPN les plus&nbsp;fiables</strong>, ils sont aussi&nbsp;plutôt novateurs et proposent des options qui deviennent régulièrement des standards.&nbsp;L&rsquo;une des dernières en date étant <strong>l&rsquo;innovation Nexus</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusivité Surfshark, <strong>Nexus</strong> permet de connecter l&rsquo;ensemble du parc de serveurs (+ de 3200) en un seul réseau qui couvre quasiment la planète entière. Le premier bénéfice étant de rendre votre <strong>connexion plus stable et rapide</strong>. Finis d&rsquo;être connecté à un serveur unique dont les performances vont&nbsp;être dégradées s&rsquo;il est surchargé. Par effet cascade le second avantage est donc d&rsquo;améliorer&nbsp;votre confidentialité. Puisque les informations transitent via plusieurs serveurs, cela fragmente la&nbsp;surveillance possible et renforce donc votre protection. Cette nouveauté sera déployée totalement d&rsquo;ici fin 2023.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"418\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/gds-surfshark4\" alt=\"Surfshark Nexus\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En attendant vous bénéficiez toujours des fonctionnalités déjà présentes :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>chiffrement de bout en bout (algo AES 256 GCM)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utilisation de protocoles sécurisés (WireGuard, IKv2/IPsec &#8230;)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>mode camouflage (cache à votre FAI que vous utilisez un VPN)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bouton kill switch (empêche vos données de fuiter lors d&rsquo;une déconnexion sauvage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>le split tunneling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>la protection lorsque vous vous connectez à un Wi-Fi public</li>\n\n\n\n<li>rotation d&rsquo;IP (sans déconnexion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>pas de conservations des logs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>blocage des pubs, cookies et autres malwares</li>\n\n\n\n<li></li>\n\n\n\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres nouveautés sont encore prévues dans les prochains mois, parce qu&rsquo;on peut toujours faire mieux. Comme par exemple la <strong>génération automatique d&rsquo;une nouvelle adresse IP</strong> pour chaque site que vous visitez (sans devoir déconnecter/reconnecter l&rsquo;outil).&nbsp;Si la&nbsp;<strong>fonction MultiHop</strong> est déjà disponible (elle permet de mettre un serveur supplémentaire entre vous et le&nbsp;site auquel vous vous connectez), elle&nbsp;disposera bientôt d&rsquo;une option pour l&rsquo;automatiser dans certains cas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"250\" height=\"141\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/krM6ANSNvFg52/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Exemple de MultiHop automatique</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous voulez tester le service pour pas cher ? Il est encore temps de <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">profiter de l&rsquo;offre Black Friday 2022</a> !&nbsp;Cette dernière&nbsp;dure jusqu&rsquo;au 27&nbsp;novembre et vous permet de ne payer que&nbsp;2.05 €&nbsp;par mois (en prenant l&rsquo;abonnement 2 ans + 2 mois offert). Pour 26 mois cela ne vous reviendra même pas à&nbsp;54€ au total, hors TVA, soit 84% de rabais. Ce qui fait toujours&nbsp;bien plaisir&nbsp;en pleine période d&rsquo;inflation. Un prix quasi&nbsp;imbattable pour un VPN de ce calibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes du genre à passer pas mal de commandes sur différents e-commerces, vous pourrez récupérer cette somme assez facilement. Comme vous le savez, les prix de certains produits, des billets d&rsquo;avions ou de trains, d&rsquo;un service de location &#8230; sont parfois dépendants de votre lieu de connexion. Avec Surfshark il suffit de tester depuis différents&nbsp;pays&nbsp;pour comparer les tarifs et prendre le plus intéressant pour vous. Et avec des serveurs dans plus de 100 localisations, il y a de quoi faire des tests et des comparaisons (sortez votre tableur Excel ;)).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l1IY5NRhxdCJYxsmA/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez même partager le prix de l&rsquo;abonnement&nbsp;avec plusieurs membres de la famille puisque le nombre d&rsquo;appareils supportés est illimité ! Votre enfant n&rsquo;a que 8 ans ? Pas d&rsquo;excuses, il faut lui apprendre les dures réalités économiques. S&rsquo;il veut continuer à regarder Adibou ou Pokémon, faut raquer ;p. Alors que d&rsquo;autres solutions vont (parfois) jusqu&rsquo;à 10 ou 12 appareils, Surfshark vous permet de protéger absolument tout et tout le monde. L&rsquo;ordinateur fixe,&nbsp;les 2 laptops, les 4 téléphones portables, la console de salon, le routeur&nbsp;et les équipements de la maison (Smart TV &amp; Co) &#8230; tout sera pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et surtout, en plus d&rsquo;être très abordable, Surfshark est&nbsp;un VPN parmi les plus fiables actuellement sur le marché. On ne compte plus les distinctions et prix qu&rsquo;ils ont reçus ces 2 dernières années.&nbsp;Si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas encore convaincu, profitez de l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://surfshark.com/fr/download\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://surfshark.com/fr/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">essai gratuit de 7 jours</a> (sur Android, iOS et macOS).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\">Découvrir Surfshark VPN</a></h2>\n",

Dispo dans le jeu <a href=\"https://returntomonkeyisland.com/the-story-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mais aussi en ligne</a>, c&rsquo;est mignon, rigolo, et bien pensé !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui frappe en premier lieu, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;univers graphique, très différent de ce qu&rsquo;on a pu voir auparavant. Faut dire que chaque jeu propose un style artistique unique, et celui-ci ne fait pas exception à la règle. Mais lorsque le jeu fut annoncé et les premières images dévoilées, nombre de trolls se sont indignés (à tel point que Ron Gilbert a cessé toute communication). J&rsquo;étais sceptique mais une fois dans le jeu, franchement, à part quelques points particuliers, c&rsquo;est magnifique. Tout est très lisible, coloré, détaillé, super bien animé…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131344\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajoutez à cela un habillage sonore enchanteur avec d&rsquo;excellentes musiques, et on est embarqué direct dans l&rsquo;ambiance !

Qu&rsquo;en est-il de ce côté là ? Eh bien, je suis désolé pour le manque de suspense mais c&rsquo;est encore une réussite. 🦜 L&rsquo;interface est bien foutue, accessible et ergonomique. Il y a un mode « facile » pour les personnes qui ne connaissent pas trop ce genre de jeu, c&rsquo;est une bonne idée mais attention, ça enlève certaines énigmes et donc certaines parties de l&rsquo;histoire. Je conseille de jouer en mode « difficile ».</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131341\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est vraiment très bien écrite, c&rsquo;est super drôle et prenant. Le rythme énigmes / dialogues / découverte de nouveaux lieux m&rsquo;a semblé équilibré, avec toujours une certaine liberté dans l&rsquo;ordre d&rsquo;appréhender les choses. On est jamais totalement coincé devant un truc sans savoir quoi faire, on peut toujours aller voir ailleurs et avancer d&rsquo;une manière ou d&rsquo;une autre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au pire, y a un système d&rsquo;aide intégré au jeu, qui donne quelques indices sans jamais dévoiler la solution. Vraiment mieux que d&rsquo;aller chercher la <em>soluce</em> sur le web, c&rsquo;est bien dosé, vraiment nickel !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131342\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On sent l&rsquo;attention porté à chaque détail, et ce, sur chaque aspect.

Ce n&rsquo;est pas un plaisir pour eux, surtout qu&rsquo;en général, le premier contact qu&rsquo;on a avec quelqu&rsquo;un, qui plus est par Internet, se fait via l&rsquo;écrit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si le message est bourré de fautes, l&rsquo;autre en face a vite fait de ranger celui qui lui écrit dans un tiroir mental étiqueté « teubé » ou assimilé alors que ce n&rsquo;est pas forcément le cas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sachez-le, quand vous faites des erreurs à l&rsquo;écrit, vous vous démarquez négativement, et cela même si vous avez de bonnes raisons « techniques » de massacrer l&rsquo;orthographe. C&rsquo;est triste mais c&rsquo;est comme ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du côté du lecteur, même si on peut être très tolérant sur les raisons qui poussent à commettre des fautes, c&rsquo;est aussi très « douloureux ». Lire un texte plein de fautes, c&rsquo;est buter sur chaque mot. L&rsquo;expérience n&rsquo;est pas agréable. Pire, quand on est censé lire un article rédigé par un journaliste, un professionnel, on se dit qu&rsquo;on est vraiment tombé sur des amateurs. Pourtant, les coquilles existent, j&rsquo;en sais quelque chose.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1303020776\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors que faire ? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plusieurs options : </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soit on s&rsquo;en fout et on espère qu&rsquo;un jour, les gens arrêtent de juger négativement ceux qui font des erreurs dans leurs messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soit on se sort les doigts et on s&rsquo;équipe.

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue.

Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Côté TikTok, ça commence a devenir également sérieux puisque j&rsquo;ai atteint <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@korbeninfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">un nombre conséquent d&rsquo;abonnés</a>.

L&rsquo;hiver est enfin là, donc le mood est au feu de cheminée, au chocolat chaud et bientôt à la raclette ^^.

Mais est-ce la seule chose que vous pouvez faire ? Bien sûr que non. Et aujourd&rsquo;hui je vais vous proposer <strong>quelques actions quotidiennes</strong> que vous pouvez mettre en place pour vous protéger sur le long terme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avant de commencer, j&rsquo;insiste juste sur le fait que chaque jour lorsque vous surfez sur le web, que vous utilisez des applications, etc. vos données sont récupérées. C&rsquo;est comme ça. Et même par des services fiables cela peut créer des problèmes. Ils peuvent se faire hacker leur base de données, des employés peuvent les revendre en soum soum ou la société peut décider de faire un rab de&nbsp;moula en la revendant une fois qu&rsquo;elle a fermé ses portes. Bref tout atterrit <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chez des data brokers qui collectent toutes ces infos</a></strong> et les revendent à prix d&rsquo;or. Parfois ces data brokers rachètent même des sites en perdition, juste pour disposer de la collecte de données qui a été réalisée (à des fins légitimes) pendant des années.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et même sans ça, vos données personnelles se retrouvent parfois disponibles en toute connaissance de cause. Par exemple sur des sites de fiches d&rsquo;entreprise lorsque vous créez une société, ou dans les fichiers PDF d&rsquo;un listing de diplômés d&rsquo;une école, de chercheurs dans une étude, etc.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"317\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/h55EUEsTG9224/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref nous sommes <strong>tous et toutes&nbsp;les vaches à lait de cette industrie</strong>. De manière directe&nbsp;ou au moins via les personnalités que nous nous créons en ligne (qui finissent par nous ressembler au final). Et s&rsquo;il est difficile de supprimer à 100% toutes nos traces numériques (surtout que la plupart du temps nous ne sommes même pas conscients d&rsquo;où elles circulent), il existe quelques possibilités pour limiter notre exposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1) Ne créez pas de compte si ce n&rsquo;est pas nécessaire</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon je sais, vous allez me dire que c&rsquo;est obvious. Je sais que ce n&rsquo;est pas votre cas, mes lecteurs adorés ont un QI supérieur à la moyenne. Mais qui ne connait pas une personne qui&nbsp;s&rsquo;ouvre un compte sur&nbsp;un e-commerce quelconque&nbsp;pour commander un objet pas cher et va ensuite laisser son compte existant pendant des années ? Peut-être qu&rsquo;en se demandant au départ si l&rsquo;objet en question est vraiment utile, le compte n&rsquo;aurait jamais eu besoin d&rsquo;être créé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"358\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPOqmCwBBEVPBOFYQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Est-ce qu&rsquo;ouvrir un 4e compte Instagram pour publier uniquement les photos&nbsp;de la tortue de compagnie&nbsp;est vraiment utile ? À vous de voir. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, passez au point suivant lorsqu&rsquo;il ne vous est plus d&rsquo;aucune utilité. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans le même esprit, ne donnez pas votre téléphone sans raison. Aussi bien dans les applis mobiles que dans les magasins physiques (si on vous les demande parfois ce n&rsquo;est que dans un seul but : vous balancer de la pub).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2) Fermer et supprimer vos comptes inutilisés</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais que vous avez déjà pensé à ce point. Mais êtes-vous vraiment un bon élève ? Vous êtes certain qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas un petit compte non utilisé depuis 2 ans et que vous gardez parce que la flemme de retrouver le mot de passe ? Ou parce qu&rsquo;on ne sait jamais, vous pourriez en avoir besoin un jour ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La question de la vie privée était beaucoup moins présente il y a 10 ans. Combien ont toujours des infos (ne serait-ce que l&#8217;email) sur des sites abandonnés comme MySpace, Flickr, StumbleUpon ou que sais-je&nbsp;? À partir du moment où votre adresse mail est quelque part, elle pourra servir à des gens pour vous bombarder de spams (selon les estimations 97% des adresses mail en reçoivent).&nbsp;Pire, imaginez qu&rsquo;il y a&nbsp;10 ans vous aviez un Skyblog&nbsp;avec une photo gênante et que l&rsquo;on parvienne à recouper l&rsquo;info avec votre adresse mail toujours active aujourd&rsquo;hui ?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2Kgm3KOBUE6wF2/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est parfois bien caché dans les options, il faut parfois envoyer un mail personnalisé, etc., mais prenez le temps de le faire.&nbsp;Vous pouvez vous aider d&rsquo;un site comme <a href=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Just Delete Me</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combien recevez-vous de communications commerciales que vous ne lisez jamais ? Est-ce que toutes les newsletters que vous recevez sont vraiment importantes ? Etc. Je suis sûr qu&rsquo;il y a moyen de limiter ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3) Renforcez la&nbsp;vie privée sur les réseaux sociaux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Là encore ça semble logique, mais beaucoup ne prennent pas le temps d&rsquo;effectuer les quelques clics nécessaires. Surtout que les réseaux sont sans doute LA source de récolte numéro 1 à l&rsquo;heure actuelle. Lorsque vous partagez votre localisation, balancez une photo d&rsquo;un endroit que vous visitez, parlez sans arrêt avec une même personne, etc. il n&rsquo;est pas très compliqué pour les algorithmes de vite se faire une&nbsp;image assez précise de vous, de vos préférences&nbsp;et de qui sont vos proches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;autant plus le cas lorsque vous connectez les services entre-eux (en vous connectant à des sites tiers avec vos identifiants Google ou&nbsp;Facebook par exemple), là ce sont tous les&nbsp;services interconnectés&nbsp;qui peuvent accéder à vos données. Les réseaux sociaux tirent littéralement leurs bénéfices des publicités ciblées. Et pour en tirer le meilleur afin que leurs pubs soient les plus&nbsp;rentables possibles ? Il leur faut accéder au max de vos infos, bingo.&nbsp;Donc les paramètres de protections par défaut sont (trop) souvent&nbsp;permissifs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/KPEpqHiJVrSVCOjyCP/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>À vous de limiter tout ça : ne pas laisser&nbsp;votre profil visible publiquement, retirer la géolocalisation,&nbsp;limiter qui a le droit de voir quoi, ne pas accepter la publicité ciblée, refuser les contenus supplémentaires, faire attention lorsque vous prenez des gens ou des lieux en photo, ne pas interconnecter les services, limiter au maximum les extensions, etc. Il y a quelques semaines&nbsp; je vous ai fait un petit guide&nbsp;pour <a href=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\">disparaitre de Google</a>, ça pourrait vous servir.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est pas non plus une mauvaise idée de supprimer vos anciens posts/tweets/photos, etc. s&rsquo;ils n&rsquo;ont plus rien à faire dans votre profil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4) Utilisez un navigateur web respectueux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Désinstallez Google Chrome, Microsoft&nbsp;Edge, Apple Safari&nbsp;&amp; Co. Privilégiez Brave, Firefox ou Tor Browser qui sont les 3 navigateurs les plus sécurisés à ce niveau. Laissez-les faire le plus gros du travail de prévention, ils bloquent par défaut de nombreux traqueurs, les profils comportementaux, etc. Pour Tor il faut quand même mentionner que certains FAI (si pas tous) vont vous brider le débit dès qu&rsquo;ils se rendront compte que vous l&rsquo;utilisez. Mais, quel que soit celui que vous choisissez, continuer à limiter le nombre d&rsquo;extensions installées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"324\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YsZBbMUeDLFNjQTtjz/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous voulez voir ce qui transparait avec votre navigateur actuel, il existe des sites <a href=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comme celui-ci</a>. Après sachez que même avec un bon navigateur, même avec un VPN, même avec Tor, etc. vous laisserez des bouts de&nbsp;traces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5) Retrouvez et faites supprimer vos infos chez les data brokers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant que vous avez limité au mieux la future&nbsp;récolte de vos données, comment faire pour celles qui trainent déjà sur la toile ? Il faudrait pouvoir retrouver tous les data brokers qui disposent de ces données, cela éviterait qu&rsquo;ils puissent continuer à les revendre. Si certains sont très connus (Spokeo, WhitePages &#8230;) pour d&rsquo;autres, il est très compliqué de remonter jusqu&rsquo;à eux. Si vous recevez un email de scam, un coup de fil marketing, etc. comment savoir d&rsquo;où ces gens ont&nbsp;obtenu vos infos ? Et lorsque vous avez fait ce travail digne de l&rsquo;inspecteur Derrick il faut encore obtenir du data broker qu&rsquo;il supprime ce qui doit l&rsquo;être. Multipliez cela par des dizaines de brokers et vous pouvez faire une croix sur vos soirées pour les 3 prochains mois.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est là qu&rsquo;intervient un service <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">comme Incogni</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"422\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/9u2-incogni1\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il vont faire le gros du travail pour vous. Déjà en répertoriant chez quels data brokers vos données personnelles se retrouvent, ensuite en les contactant à votre place&nbsp;pour qu&rsquo;ils&nbsp;suppriment ces données&nbsp;et ensuite en faisant un suivit pour s&rsquo;assurer qu&rsquo;elles ne réapparaissent pas dans les prochaines années. Et si les brokers ne répondent pas aux demandes, Incogni va les relancer jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Qu&rsquo;ils soient contactés par un service dont c&rsquo;est la spécialité ou par le mail dindon63@gmail.com de Mr Machin , ça risque de faire&nbsp;une différence 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez pas mal bourlingué sur le web depuis de nombreuses années et avec une identité&nbsp;figée (même adresse mail, même numéro de téléphone, mêmes services utilisés &#8230;), votre profil doit être assez précis et répandu. Pour moins de 6€/mois, la solution Incogni fera le nécessaire et vous tiendra au courant étape par étape via son tableau de bord. J&rsquo;ai d&rsquo;ailleurs <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">testé Incogni en détail</a> pour vous montrer comment cela se passe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"414\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer un peu tout ça, il faut avoir une bonne hygiène numérique au quotidien. Et lorsque les choses ont pris une certaine ampleur (ou que l&rsquo;on prend seulement conscience de l&rsquo;importance de faire respecter sa vie privée) il y a des services comme Incogni pour nous épauler. Bref nous ne sommes pas sans ressources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">Découvrez Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Déjà, y&rsquo;a pas de client pour Linux. Mais surtout, on ne peut pas sauvegarder sur Backblaze tout ce qui est disque « réseaux ». Donc si vous avez un NAS par exemple, et bien vous ne pourrez pas le stocker chez eux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À moins de prendre leur abonnement B2 qui offre un stockage pur et dur sans logiciel client. Et des outils de backups qu&rsquo;on trouve un peu partout, intégrant le plus souvent B2, au côté d&rsquo;autres trucs comme Amazon S3, ou Azure Backup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sauf que si vous payez déjà le <a href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00wmi7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Backup de Backblaze</a>, c&rsquo;est un peu relou de devoir tout refaire sur B2. Surtout que là, on sort un peu de l&rsquo;offre intéressante puisque vous devrez payer ce que vous consommez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors, comment faire ? </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1, vous décidez d&rsquo;adopter une mentalité One Life et abandonnez toute notion de sauvegarde.</li><li>Option 2, vous décidez de passer à la caisse parce que vous êtes blindé de thune et que vous avez du temps</li><li>Option 3, vous trichez et vous vous arrangez pour sauvegarder vos disques réseau sur Backblaze avec l&rsquo;option « Personal Backup ».</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-403108731\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Mais avant, un petit rappel du principe des sauvegardes 3-2-1. Le concept est simple : pour avoir des sauvegardes efficaces et sérieuses, vous devez réaliser : </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 sauvegardes. 2 de ces sauvegardes sont stockées sur des supports différents (par exemple, un disque externe + un NAS) et la 3e sauvegarde doit être conservée hors site (donc pas chez vous). Cela peut être sur le cloud ou chez Tata Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée c&rsquo;est que si un incendie se déclare chez vous parce que vous avez chauffé votre maison avec vos meubles à cause de Bruno Lemaire, et bien même si toute votre famille a brulé, au moins, vous avez un backup de vos épisodes de Naruto.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130921\" width=\"494\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-300x122.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-768x312.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment pour gagner du temps, vous pouvez faire partir les 2 premiers backups (locaux) depuis votre ordinateur et le dernier off-site depuis votre NAS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour revenir à Backblaze en cas de souci, vous pourrez alors récupérer vos données soit en les téléchargeant directement depuis leur site, soit en vous faisant livrer un disque dur contenant vos données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors, maintenant comment faire pour sauvegarder TOUT votre NAS vers Backblaze alors que les disques réseau ne sont pas supportés dans leur application cliente ?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1681548937\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Et bien c&rsquo;est simple, il faut gruger un peu et faire croire à l&rsquo;outil que les répertoires réseau que vous voulez envoyer là-bas sont des répertoires locaux. Et pour cela, 2 façons de faire en fonction de votre OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes sous Windows, il vous faudra utiliser le logiciel libre <a href=\"http://dokan-dev.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dokany</a> qui permet de monter des systèmes de fichiers divers et variés (disque externe, disque réseau&#8230;etc.) pour les intégrer dans votre système de fichier actuel afin que toutes vos applications Windows puissent y accéder en toute transparence. Ainsi le client Backblaze verra ces fichiers comme s&rsquo;ils étaient locaux et procédera à la sauvegarde. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"796\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/687474703a2f2f646f6b616e2d6465762e6769746875622e696f2f696d616765732f73637265656e636173742e676966.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130922\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez bien sûr avoir d&rsquo;autres cas d&rsquo;usage pour cet outil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et sous macOS, c&rsquo;est le même concept sauf que ce n&rsquo;est pas le même outil. Et celui-ci est payant, car les gens qui utilisent des logiciels Apple ont de la grosse moula évidemment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il vous faudra donc vous offrir le logiciel <a href=\"https://automounter.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AutoMounter</a> pour la modique somme de 17 $ afin de monter vos disques distants un peu n&rsquo;importe où sur votre système macOS.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130923\" width=\"382\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp 653w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg-255x300.webp 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ce n&rsquo;est pas plus compliqué que ça. Et évidemment, les sauvegardes se feront de manière fluide, avec le client Windows ou MacOS <a href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00wmi7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backblaze</a> dans le cadre de votre forfait Personal Backup.</p>\n",

Mais voici quand même un exemple. Imaginons que dans votre dossier Downloads, vous ayez des tas de PDF que vous voulez déplacer dans un sous-dossier PDF ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lancez l&rsquo;édition de la config d&rsquo;Organize et scriptez comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># organize configuration file\n# https://organize.readthedocs.io\nrules:\n  - name: \"Find PDFs\"\n    locations:\n      - ~/Downloads\n    subfolders: true\n    filters:\n      - extension: pdf\n    actions:\n      - echo: \"Found PDF!\"\n      - move: ~/Downloads/PDFs/\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130867\" width=\"750\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp 821w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-300x281.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-768x718.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, une règle se compose : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>D&rsquo;un nom (name) (Vous mettre ce que vous voulez)</li><li>D&rsquo;un ou plusieurs emplacements (locations)</li><li>D&rsquo;actions (actions) pour afficher des messages ou agir sur les fichiers</li><li>Et d&rsquo;un tas d&rsquo;autres paramètres comme le parcours des sous dossiers, le filtrage des fichiers par extension&#8230;etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1876307667\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Cet exemple n&rsquo;est pas exhaustif. Il est par exemple possible de désactiver une règle en passant à « false » le paramètre « enabled ». Les filtres sont également intéressant car ils permettent de débusquer les fichiers selon la structure de leur nom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il y a vraiment beaucoup de paramètres qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans chacune de vos règles donc je vous invite encore une fois à vous pencher sur la doc. Si par malheur, Organize rencontre des conflits de fichiers, l&rsquo;outil dispose également d&rsquo;options pour résoudre cela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les données Exif peuvent également être extraites des fichiers pour ensuite être utilisées à votre convenance et l&rsquo;outil est capable d&rsquo;extraire du contenu de PDFs ou de fichiers DOCX&#8230;etc our mieux les catégoriser. C&rsquo;est hyper puissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un mode « simulation » permet également de tester vos règles sans risque afin d&rsquo;éviter de massacrer vos fichiers en cas d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un outil formidable qui en fait beaucoup. L&rsquo;essayer c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;adopter !</p>\n",

Et parmi les dernières nouveautés&nbsp;du service, on note qu&rsquo;ils ont dorénavant&nbsp;un parc de plus de 3200&nbsp;serveurs <strong>répartis dans plus de 100 pays différents</strong> ! Les nouveaux pays sont le Ghana, l&rsquo;Arabie Saoudite et Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;interface pour Linux (souvent le parent pauvre des OS) a récemment été retravaillée pour&nbsp;plus de lisibilité&nbsp;et voit l&rsquo;ajout d&rsquo;un bouton Kill Switch plutôt pratique. <strong>Le mode camouflage</strong> est, lui aussi, toujours de la partie. Pour rappel c&rsquo;est un mode assez sympa qui permet de cacher même à votre fournisseur d&rsquo;accès Internet que vous utiliser un VPN.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark dans 100 pays\" class=\"wp-image-131115\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark-300x147.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption><em>source : blog Surfshark</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cerise sur la tarte le nombre d&rsquo;appareils qui peuvent être connectés sur un compte est &#8230; illimité.&nbsp;Ordinateur fixe/portable, téléphones perso et pro, téléviseur intelligent,&nbsp;Google Home ou Alexa, routeur&nbsp;&#8230; tout est couvert !

Un moteur de recherche (<em>Surfshark Search</em>)&nbsp;qui vous permet d&rsquo;obtenir des résultats non traqués et impartiaux (pas des résultats faussés par votre historique et vos recherches précédentes). Un système de surveillance (<em>Surfshark Alerts</em>)&nbsp;qui permet&nbsp;d&rsquo;être alerté si certaines de vos informations personnelles sont divulguées.

Si vous utilisez déjà Surfshark pour surfer, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien de plus à installer pour profiter de l&rsquo;antivirus. Celui-ci est intégré au logiciel et ça permet d&rsquo;alléger votre machine en ayant un seul outil qui fait tout.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l4w-surfshark-antivirus\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Disponible sous Windows, macOS et Android, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark est vraiment très facile à utiliser</a>. Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Slick Inbox reçoit alors les missives électroniques pour les centraliser dans son application !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221006-m1g.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130710\" width=\"542\" height=\"548\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous ne connaissez pas de bonnes newsletters auxquelles vous abonner, ne vous inquiétez pas puisque Slick Inbox propose un kiosque avec des tonnes de newsletters classées par catégories : Design, Marketing, Développement Personnel, Technologie, Jeux Vidéos, Musique, Développement, Finance et j&rsquo;en passe&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi l&rsquo;application vous permet également de recevoir des motifs, de mettre en favori certaines newsletters, mais également d&rsquo;archiver ce que vous voulez&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un nouveau moyen bien pratique pour conjuguer ce moyen de communication archaïque qu&rsquo;est la newsletter avec nos vies trépidantes d&rsquo;hommes et de femmes modernes qui n&rsquo;ont pas de temps à perdre avec leur boite mail (genre moi).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ps : Je crois également que <a href=\"https://korben.info/feedly.html\"><strong>Feedly</strong></a> fait ça aussi.</p>\n",

Mais la vérité est ailleurs surtout pour les développeurs qui savent que le monde se divise en réalité entre le Frontend et le Backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour que ces 2 faces d&rsquo;une même pièce puissent « discuter », il nous faut des API. API, ça veut dire Application Programming Interface et c&rsquo;est tout simplement un ensemble d&rsquo;instructions permettant aux applications de communiquer entre elles. Maintenant des types d&rsquo;API, il y en a des tonnes, mais je vous propose qu&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui on s&rsquo;intéresse aux API qui respectent le standard architectural REST. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, quand on travaille en tant que développeur, on ne peut pas passer à côté des API REST, tant cette pratique est très répandue. Si vous débutez dans votre métier, c&rsquo;est forcement quelque chose que vous devez apprendre et maitriser. De la même manière, quand on débute sa carrière de développeur ou qu&rsquo;on a déjà beaucoup d&rsquo;années au compteur mais qu&rsquo;on ne connaît pas sa valeur sur le marché de l&#8217;emploi, il est bon de connaître la grille des salaires en France. Ça tombe bien puisque&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io a mis en ligne une étude des salaires de la tech en 2022</a></strong>&nbsp;pour que vous puissiez déterminer si votre salaire est correct ou sous évalué.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à vous plonger dedans afin de savoir où vous vous situez sur cette grille des salaires.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\"><img src=\"https://me.korben.info/w96-talent-bun\" alt=\"\" width=\"733\" height=\"484\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>C&rsquo;est quoi une API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>REST, ça veut dire « Representational State Transfer ». Lorsqu&rsquo;une API respecte les contraintes de REST, on parle alors d&rsquo;une API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand un développeur veut créer une API RESTful, il doit alors respecter les contraintes édictées par REST, notamment sur le fait que son API doit fonctionner au travers du protocole HTTP et de ses verbes (GET, POST&#8230;etc.) et que les requêtes et les réponses de l&rsquo;API soient dans un format texte tels que JSON, HTML, XML&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les API RESTful sont alors mises à disposition des applications via ce qu&rsquo;on appelle des endpoints. Un endpoint est un assemblage de 2 choses : une URI et un verbe HTTP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admettons que j&rsquo;ai une API qui permette de lister des utilisateurs, mais également d&rsquo;en créer des nouveaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;URI de mon API est la suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:&#47;&#47;url.com/api/user</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le but du jeu, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;appeler par exemple ce endpoint avec le verbe GET pour obtenir une liste de tous les utilisateurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>GET: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou pour ajouter un nouvel utilisateur, on peut utiliser le verbe POST comme ceci, en transmettant un bout de JSON contenant toutes les informations liées à l&rsquo;utilisateur qu&rsquo;on souhaite créer (nom, prénom&#8230;etc.) : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>POST: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée là, c&rsquo;est de vous montrer qu&rsquo;on peut interagir avec l&rsquo;API à l&rsquo;aide de différents verbes HTTP. Get peut être assimilé au verbe « lire », POST au verbe « créer », PUT et PATCH au verbe « Mettre à jour » et DELETE au verbe « supprimer ». C&rsquo;est aussi simple que cela. Et en retour le serveur peut alors répondre avec des codes de status HTTP classiques comme 200, 201, 2002&#8230;etc. pour dire que tout est OK, ou des codes de redirection 3xx, d&rsquo;erreur client 4xx ou d&rsquo;erreur serveur 5xx.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ce qui concerne le format utilisé par les requêtes et les réponses, vous pouvez utiliser du texte, peu importe son format (html, xml.etc.), mais par convention, on utilise surtout du JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Et JSON ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON a la particularité d&rsquo;être facile à lire et à écrire pour les humains et est utilisé pour enregistrer des données dans des bases de données, mais également pour transmettre ces données entre les applications. C&rsquo;est pourquoi on l&rsquo;utilise dans les API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON est une collection de paires nom / valeur qui sont ordonnées dans une liste. Ainsi les valeurs contenues dans le JSON peuvent être une chaine de caractère (string), un nombre, mais également des objets JSON, des tableaux de valeurs (Array), des booléens (true / false) ou la fameuse valeur null.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà concernant les grands principes des API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comment créer votre première API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant je vous propose qu&rsquo;on apprenne à en créer une de zéro. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est super simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour cette démo, j&rsquo;ai choisi d&rsquo;utiliser Python comme d&rsquo;habitude. Et je vais importer dans mon code le framework <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flask</a> qui va me permettre de faire monter mon API RESTful très facilement. Installez Flask comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pip3 install flask-restful</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour tester l&rsquo;API, nous allons utiliser un outil qui permet à la fois de balancer nos requêtes et de voir si les réponses correspondent bien. L&rsquo;un des plus connus s&rsquo;appelle Postman et c&rsquo;est gratuit en version de base pour tester. L&rsquo;application Desktop de Postman <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">est disponible ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/3y1-talent-API-REST\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, nous allons définir ce que va faire notre API. Ce sera quelque chose d&rsquo;assez simple permettant de créer, supprimer, lire et mettre à jour des données. Admettons que j&rsquo;ai un site sur lequel je dois référencer des produits. Chacun de ces produits aura un id, un nom, un prix et une catégorie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le code de votre première API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vais donc créer un fichier productAPI.py et je vais importer Flask comme ceci avec ses imports spécifiques aux API et au parsing JSON :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api, reqparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Puis je vais créer une espèce de mini base de données JSON directement dans mon code afin d&rsquo;y référencer mes produits :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>products = &#91;\n    { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Stylo 4 couleurs\", \"price\": 10, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cahier vert\", \"price\": 20, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Télévision 4K\", \"price\": 30, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Souris sans fil\", \"price\": 40, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 5, \"name\": \"Ananas\", \"price\": 50, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 6, \"name\": \"Kinder Bueno\", \"price\": 60, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 7, \"name\": \"Chemise de président\", \"price\": 70, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 8, \"name\": \"T-shirt de punk\", \"price\": 80, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 9, \"name\": \"Tournevis bleu\", \"price\": 90, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" },\n    { \"id\": 10, \"name\": \"Marteau rouge\", \"price\": 100, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" }\n    ]</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant on va créer une classe Product qui sera vu comme un endpoint au niveau de notre API. Et dans cette class, nous allons placer nos 4 fonctions correspondantes aux 4 verbes HTTP dont je vous ai parlé plus haut.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>class Product(Resource):\n\n    def get(self, id):\n\n    def post(self, id):\n\n    def put(self, id):\n\n    def delete(self, id):</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La structure de base de notre API est OK. Maintenant, on va définir chacune de ces fonctions en commençant par la fonction get utilisée pour récupérer les informations d&rsquo;un produit à partir de son ID. Comme vous pouvez le voir, on fait une boucle « for » qui va parcourir l&rsquo;ensemble des produits et si l&rsquo;ID correspond à ce qui spécifié dans la requête, on renvoie l&rsquo;objet « product » avec son code HTTP 200 et si ce n&rsquo;est pas le cas, on renvoie un message « Produit introuvable » accompagné d&rsquo;un code d&rsquo;erreur HTTP 404 qui correspond à une ressource non trouvée.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return product, 200\n        return \"Produit introuvable\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction suivante va nous permettre de créer un nouveau produit. La donnée utilisée dans la requête étant structurée en JSON, cette fonction va utiliser le parseur de Flask pour extraire toutes les données du JSON et les ajouter à notre tableau de produits : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def post(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return \"Ce produit {} existe deja\".format(id), 400\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois que le produit est créé, on retourne le code 201 qui veut dire que la création s&rsquo;est bien déroulée. Et si le produit existait déjà avec cet ID, on renvoie le code 400 avec un message d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction put suivante est assez similaire puisqu&rsquo;elle permet à la fois de créer un nouveau produit (si l&rsquo;id n&rsquo;est pas encore utilisé) ou de mettre à jour un produit existant.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def put(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                product&#91;\"name\"] = args&#91;\"name\"]\n                product&#91;\"price\"] = args&#91;\"price\"]\n                product&#91;\"category\"] = args&#91;\"category\"]\n                return product, 200\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, la fonction delete permettra de supprimer un enregistrement à partir de son ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def delete(self, id):\n        global products\n        products = &#91;product for product in products if product&#91;\"id\"] != id]\n        return \"{} is deleted.\".format(id), 200</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois ces fonctions définies, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à spécifier le format de l&rsquo;URI qui sera utilisé pour appeler l&rsquo;API et lancer l&rsquo;API (en mode debug pour démarrer). Le paramètre &lt;int:id&gt; permet d&rsquo;indiquer que dans le chemin du endpoint, on peut ajouter une variable acceptée par l&rsquo;API (ici l&rsquo;ID du produit).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>api.add_resource(Product, \"/product/&lt;int:id&gt;\")\napp.run(debug=True)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tester l&rsquo;API avec Postman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à lancer le script python à l&rsquo;aide de la commande suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python3 productAPI.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serveur web de Flask se lancera alors et vous verrez apparaitre une URL locale que vous pourrez appeler dans Postman pour ensuite tester votre API.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

produit (grâce à son ID) : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

qu&rsquo;on souhaite transmettre un contenu de type « RAW » au format JSON et appeler le endpoint avec l&rsquo;ID de notre nouveau produit (ce n&rsquo;est pas l&rsquo;idéal bien sûr, car le principe d&rsquo;un nouvel ID c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il soit généré directement par le code de l&rsquo;API, mais c&rsquo;est pour illustrer mon exemple).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure

/></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Et ensuite ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, ce n&rsquo;est vraiment pas compliqué à développer. Ici on est sur un exemple simple, mais ensuite, vous devrez pourquoi pas sortir vos données d&rsquo;une base de données, penser à correctement gérer les erreurs et faire preuve de rigueur dans la structure de vos endpoints. Par exemple, dans mon endpoint, l&rsquo;URI est xxxx/product/. J&rsquo;aurais pu faire mieux en respectant la convention et en mettant/products/ au pluriel. Car en cas de GET, je peux aussi demander à récupérer l&rsquo;ensemble des produits existants. Dans ce cas, je dois modifier ma fonction GET comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        if (id == 0):\n            return products, 200\n        else:\n            for product in products:\n                if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                    return product, 200\n            return \"Product not found\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, en passant l&rsquo;id 0 lors de mon GET, je récupérerai alors tous les produits.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"687\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130939\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp 687w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99-268x300.webp 268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas également de documenter l&rsquo;ensemble de votre API afin de vous y retrouver et surtout d&rsquo;indiquer à d&rsquo;autres développeurs, comment l&rsquo;intégrer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà, j&rsquo;espère que cette petite initiation et explications aux API RESTful vous aura intéressé et donné envie de vous y mettre plus sérieusement. Peut-être changer un peu votre façon de coder, voire carrément changer de job pour trouver une équipe plus agile et plus au fait des pratiques de dev modernes. Et pourquoi pas en profiter pour continuer à évoluer dans les technologies, ou obtenir un meilleur salaire. C’est une démarche qui peut s’avérer assez compliquée, stressante parfois, tant on a envie de trouver un travail qui nous corresponde. On peut souhaiter avoir un travail plus proche de chez soi voire en télétravail complet, un meilleur salaire, une meilleure ambiance au travail, ou même tout ça à la fois (mais ce n’est pas forcément facile à trouver).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heureusement, talent.io est là pour vous aider. Il vous suffit de&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">créer un compte sur la plateforme talent.io</a></strong>&nbsp;en quelques clics pour ensuite recevoir des offres de la part d’entreprises qui correspondent à vos critères précis et qui affichent un salaire d’entrée de jeu. talent.io est vraiment le moyen le plus simple de trouver son prochain job tech, d’ailleurs les inscrits trouvent leur emploi en 20 jours en moyenne.</p>\n",

Ce site vous permet de construire des « prompts », c&rsquo;est-à-dire des phrases à destination d&rsquo;outils comme Midjourney ou encore Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le principe est simple. Vous lui passez des URLs d&rsquo;images dont vous aimez le style, vous agrémentez tout cela de mots clés que vous pouvez pondérer puis vous pouvez choisir <a href=\"https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">des tas de paramètres et de styles</a> proposés et supportés par votre générateur (au hasard Midjourney) afin d&rsquo;obtenir le résultat de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Après moultes essais et inspiration prise dans la galerie de Midjourney et à l&rsquo;aide de DoctorMars (fidèle de Korben.info), j&rsquo;ai réussi à passer de ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130559\" width=\"493\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-300x79.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-768x203.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-779997892\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>À ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130560\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-300x300.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-150x150.webp 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-768x768.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce que je peux vous dire, c&rsquo;est que ce n&rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&rsquo;il y parait.

On s&rsquo;affronte par équipe de 4 en balançant de l&rsquo;encre partout ; et c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;équipe qui aura colorié le plus de territoire de sa propre couleur qui gagne la partie. C&rsquo;est ici que le jeu se démarque, car même si vous ne savez pas très bien viser, vous pouvez être utile à votre équipe. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Splatoon 3 – Maintenant disponible !

On peut facilement varier les plaisirs !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les modes de jeu, eux aussi, sont variés. Entre les matchs classiques, les parties « ranked » (matchs « anarchie » avec différentes règles du jeu possible !), ou bien en coopératif… Il y a de quoi faire ! On a même un jeu de carte assez cool, où l&rsquo;on construit son propre deck. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130718\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-300x168.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-768x431.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02.jpg 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le mode solo n&rsquo;est pas en reste, il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un tutorial géant mais vraiment sympa, où l&rsquo;on alterne entre phases d&rsquo;exploration et épreuves, nous faisant découvrir un large éventail d&rsquo;armes et de techniques. Bref, au niveau du contenu, c&rsquo;est vraiment généreux, sans même parler des cosmétiques, rangs et armes à débloquer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1910884207\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Techniquement, hormis la Cité-clabousse qui rame (allez savoir pourquoi), le jeu est ultra bien foutu : c&rsquo;est beau, lisible, super fluide ! La plate-forme réseau manque encore un peu de stabilité, mais elle est toute récente et s&rsquo;améliore continuellement, donc sur le moyen/long terme ça devrait le faire. Enfin j&rsquo;espère. 🤞</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130719\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Les menus ne sont pas d&rsquo;une ergonomie sans faille, ils ont voulu faire un truc classe avec un hub, des boutiques, etc. C&rsquo;est joli mais au final on se perd un peu, on perd du temps, et pire, on passe à côté de certaines options (perso j&rsquo;ai mis un temps fou à comprendre comment jouer à Cartes &amp; Territoire, ou comment modifier la skin de mon inkling)… C&rsquo;est un peu dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ceci étant dit, c&rsquo;est toujours mieux que dans Splatoon 2 ! 😁 Il y a de nettes améliorations, par exemple, on peut zapper l&rsquo;introduction de chaque nouvelle rotation de maps. Y a eu de vrais efforts pour rendre l&rsquo;expérience plus agréable. Quelques autres apports, en vrac :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Un meilleur lobby (avec entrainement pendant l&rsquo;attente, etc.)</li><li>De nouveaux mouvements pour nos calamars</li><li>Un casier à décorer avec des stickers</li><li>Nouvelles armes, maps, cosmétiques…</li><li>Les matchs à 3 équipes !</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130720\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Concrètement, ce n&rsquo;est pas une suite révolutionnaire, mais elle améliore et apporte plein de petites choses. Au final, quand on met tout bout à bout, ça fait une grosse différence. Si vous aimez les shooters, c&rsquo;est super original et surtout : très fun !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e9cJAw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acheter Splatoon 3 sur Nintendo Switch</a></h2>\n",

C&rsquo;est à dire qu&rsquo;on fait la course, mais en se goinfrant le plus possible sur le chemin : car c&rsquo;est la personne qui aura dévoré le plus de sucreries à la fin des 4 manches qui aura gagné. 😋 Deux manches sur circuits (à la manière d&rsquo;un Mario Kart en plus léger), et deux manches en arène (où on ramasse un max de gourmandises en essayant de faire tomber les autres pour piquer les leurs) : à la fin on pèse les Kirbys et que le plus lourd gagne !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130668\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le gameplay se résume à l&rsquo;essentiel : déplacement, saut, attaque spéciale (grâce aux bonus récupérés ici et là). Il y a juste la gestion de l&rsquo;inertie, propre à la petite boule qu&rsquo;on dirige, qui va demander quelques petites minutes d&rsquo;adaptation : le concept est aussi simple que la prise en main est immédiate, c&rsquo;est un party-game d&rsquo;une efficacité assez redoutable. Et tellement mignon&#8230; 🥰</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niveau contenu, en terme de modes de jeux ou nombre de circuits/niveaux, là aussi on se contente de l&rsquo;essentiel. Pas de quoi être déçu, car c&rsquo;est cohérent avec le prix affiché (15€). Pour les fous furieux, sachez qu&rsquo;il y a des tonnes de petits cosmétiques et autres à débloquer. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130669\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1146385180\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Jouable à 4 en ligne ou en local (chacun sa console), mais pas en écran splitté sur la même console : là on est limités à 2 joueurs.

Donc du matos réellement testé sur lequel chacun vient donner son avis. À vous ensuite de faire le tri en fonction de ce qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Est-ce le prix, la note du benchmark, la capacité, la vitesse ou la note globale ?
