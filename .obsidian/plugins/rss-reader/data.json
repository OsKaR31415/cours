Mechanical work irreversibly turns into heat. The Second Law of thermodynamics is considered one of the great general principles of physical science. But 150 years <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>after it was first introduced</a>, there’s still something deeply mysterious about the Second Law. It almost seems like it’s going to be “provably true”. But one <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--current-thinking-on-the-second-law/'>never quite gets there</a>; it always seems to need something extra. Sometimes textbooks will gloss over everything; sometimes they’ll give some kind of “common-sense-but-outside-of-physics argument”. But the mystery of the Second Law has never gone away.</p>\n<p>Why does the Second Law work? And does it even in fact always work, or is it actually sometimes violated? What does it really depend on? What would be needed to “prove it”? </p>\n<p>For me personally the quest to understand the Second Law has been no less than a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>50-year story</a>. But back in the 1980s, as I began to explore the computational universe of simple programs, I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>discovered a fundamental phenomenon</a> that was immediately reminiscent of the Second Law. And in the 1990s I started to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>map out just how this phenomenon might</a> finally be able to demystify the Second Law. But it is only now—with ideas that have emerged from our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>—that I think I can pull all the pieces together and finally be able to construct a proper framework to explain why—and to what extent—the Second Law is true.<span id=\"more-43551\"></span></p>\n<p>In its usual conception, the Second Law is a law of thermodynamics, concerned with the dynamics of heat. But it turns out that there’s a vast generalization of it that’s possible. And in fact my key realization is that the Second Law is ultimately just a manifestation of the very same core computational phenomenon that is at the heart of our Physics Project and indeed the whole conception of science that is emerging from our study of the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a> and the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s all a story of the interplay between underlying <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> and our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>nature as computationally bounded observers</a>. Other observers—or even our own future technology—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>might see things differently</a>. But at least for us now the ubiquity of computational irreducibility leads inexorably to the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p315--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness/'>generation of behavior</a> that we—with our computationally bounded nature—will <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p552--defining-the-notion-of-randomness/'>read as &#8220;random”</a>. We might start from something highly ordered (like gas molecules all in the corner of a box) but soon—at least as far as we’re concerned—it will typically seem to “randomize”, just as the Second Law implies.</p>\n<p>In the twentieth century there emerged three great physical theories: general relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, with the Second Law being the defining phenomenon of statistical mechanics. But while there was a sense that statistical mechanics (and in particular the Second Law) should somehow be “formally derivable”, general relativity and quantum mechanics seemed quite different. But our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project has changed that picture</a>. And the remarkable thing is that it now seems as if all three of general relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics are actually derivable, and from the same ultimate foundation: the interplay between computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of observers like us.</p>\n<p>The case of statistical mechanics and the Second Law is in some ways simpler than the other two because in statistical mechanics it’s realistic to separate the observer from the system they’re observing, while in general relativity and quantum mechanics it’s essential that the observer be an integral part of the system. It also helps that phenomena about things like molecules in statistical mechanics are much more familiar to us today than those about atoms of space or branches of multiway systems. And by studying the Second Law we’ll be able to develop intuition that we can use elsewhere, say in discussing “molecular” vs. “fluid” levels of description in my recent exploration of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>physicalization of the foundations of metamathematics</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>The Core Phenomenon of the Second Law</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1019b/'>earliest statements of the Second Law</a> were things like: “Heat doesn’t flow from a colder body to a hotter one” or “You can’t systematically purely convert heat to mechanical work”. Later on there came the somewhat more abstract statement “Entropy tends to increase”. But in the end, all these statements boil down to the same idea: that somehow things always tend to get progressively “more random”. What may start in an orderly state will—according to the Second Law—inexorably “degrade” to a “randomized” state.</p>\n<p>But how general is this phenomenon? Does it just apply to heat and temperature and molecules and things? Or is it something that applies across a whole range of kinds of systems? </p>\n<p>The answer, I believe, is that underneath the Second Law there’s a very general phenomenon that’s extremely robust. And that has the potential to apply to pretty much any kind of system one can imagine. </p>\n<p>Here’s a longtime favorite example of mine: <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>the rule 30 cellular automaton</a>:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img1_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img1B.png\" alt='' title='' width='595' height=''> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Start from a simple “orderly” state, here containing just a single non-white cell. Then apply the rule over and over again. The pattern that emerges has some definite, visible structure. But many aspects of it “seem random”. Just as in the Second Law, even starting from something “orderly”, one ends up getting something “random”.</p>\n<p>But is it “really random”? It’s completely determined by the initial condition and rule, and you can always recompute it. But the subtle yet critical point is that if you’re just given the output, it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes/'>can still &#8220;seem random&#8221;</a> in the sense that no known methods operating purely on this output can find regularities in it.</p>\n<p>It’s reminiscent of the situation with something like the digits of π. There’s a fairly simple algorithm for generating these digits. Yet once generated, the digits on their own seem for practical purposes random.</p>\n<p>In studying physical systems there’s a long history of assuming that whenever randomness is seen, it somehow comes from outside the system. Maybe it’s the effect of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-3--randomness-from-the-environment'>&#8220;thermal noise&#8221; or &#8220;perturbations&#8221;</a> acting on the system. Maybe it’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-4--chaos-theory-and-randomness-from-initial-conditions'>chaos-theory-style &#8220;excavation&#8221;</a> of higher-order digits supplied through real-number initial conditions. But the surprising <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/origins-randomness-physical-systems.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>discovery I made in the 1980s</a> by looking at things like rule 30 is that actually no such “external source” is needed: instead, it’s perfectly possible for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-5--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness'>randomness to be generated intrinsically</a> within a system just through the process of applying definite underlying rules.</p>\n<p>How can one understand this? The key is to think in computational terms. And ultimately the source of the phenomenon is the interplay between the computational process associated with the actual evolution of the system and the computational processes that our perception of the output of that evolution brings to bear.</p>\n<p>We might have thought if a system had a simple underlying rule—like rule 30—then it’d always be straightforward to predict what the system will do. Of course, we could in principle always just run the rule and see what happens. But the question is whether we can expect to “jump ahead” and “find the outcome”, with much less computational effort than the actual evolution of the system involves.</p>\n<p>And an important conclusion of a lot of science I did in the 1980s and 1990s is that for many systems—presumably including rule 30—it’s simply not possible to “jump ahead”. And instead the evolution of the system is what I call <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computationally irreducible</a>—so that it takes an irreducible amount of computational effort to find out what the system does. </p>\n<p>Ultimately this is a consequence of what I call the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>, which states that above some low threshold, systems always end up being equivalent in the sophistication of the computations they perform. And this is why even our brains and our most sophisticated methods of scientific analysis can’t “computationally outrun” even something like rule 30, so that we must consider it computationally irreducible.</p>\n<p>So how does this relate to the Second Law? It’s what makes it possible for a system like rule 30 to operate according to a simple underlying rule, yet to intrinsically generate what seems like random behavior. If we could do all the necessary computationally irreducible work then we could in principle “see through” to the simple rules underneath. But the key point (emphasized by our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>) is that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers like us are computationally bounded</a> in our capabilities. And this means that we’re not able to “see through the computational irreducibility”—with the result that the behavior we see “looks random to us”.</p>\n<p>And in thermodynamics that “random-looking” behavior is what we associate with heat. And the Second Law assertion that energy associated with systematic mechanical work tends to “degrade into heat” then corresponds to the fact that when there’s computational irreducibility the behavior that’s generated is something we can’t readily “computationally see through”—so that it appears random to us.</p>\n<h2 id='the-road-from-ordinary-thermodynamics'>The Road from Ordinary Thermodynamics</h2>\n<p>Systems like rule 30 make the phenomenon of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-5--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness'>intrinsic randomness generation</a> particularly clear. But how do such systems relate to the ones that thermodynamics usually studies? The original formulation of the Second Law involved gases, and the vast majority of its applications even today still concern things like gases.</p>\n<p>At a basic level, a typical gas consists of a collection of discrete molecules that interact through collisions. And as an idealization of this, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>we can consider hard spheres</a> that move according to the standard laws of mechanics and undergo perfectly elastic collisions with each other, and with the walls of a container. Here’s an example of a sequence of snapshots from a <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/HardSphereSimulation'>simulation of such a system</a>, done in 2D: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img2_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img2.png\" alt='' title='' width='571' height='454'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>We begin with an organized “flotilla” of “molecules”, systematically going in a particular direction (and not touching, to avoid a “Newton’s Cradle” many-collisions-at-a-time effect). But after these molecules collide with a wall, they quickly start to move in what seem like much more random ways. The original systematic motion is like what happens when one is “doing mechanical work”, say moving a solid object. But what we see is that—just as the Second Law implies—this motion is quickly “degraded” into disordered and seemingly random “heat-like” microscopic motion.</p>\n<p>Here’s a “spacetime” view of the behavior:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img3_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img3.png\" alt='' title='' width='549' height='286'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Looking from far away, with each molecule’s spacetime trajectory shown as a slightly transparent tube, we get:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img4_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img4.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='216'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>There’s already some qualitative similarity with the rule 30 behavior we saw above. But there are many detailed differences. And one of the most obvious is that while rule 30 just has a discrete collection of cells, the spheres in the hard-sphere gas can be at any position. And, what’s more, the precise details of their positions can have an increasingly large effect. If two elastic spheres collide perfectly head on, they’ll bounce back the way they came. But as soon as they’re even slightly off center they’ll bounce back at a different angle, and if they do this repeatedly even the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p312--chaos-theory-and-randomness-from-initial-conditions/'>tiniest initial off-centeredness will be arbitrarily amplified</a>:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img5A_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img5.png\" alt='' title='' width='555' height='86'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>And, yes, this chaos-theory-like phenomenon makes it <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-4-7--problems-with-computer-experiments-in-chaos-theory/'>very difficult even to do an accurate simulation on a computer</a> with limited numerical precision.

Yet we saw above that if we start from a “simple initial condition” and then just run the rule, it will “produce increasing randomness”. But what if we reverse the rule, and run it backwards? Well, since the rule is reversible, the same thing must happen: we must get increasing randomness. But how can it be that “randomness increases” both going forward in time and going backward? Here’s a picture that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p443--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>shows what&#8217;s going on</a>: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img50_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img50.png\" alt='' title='' width='551' height='375'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>In the middle the system takes on a “simple state”. But going either forward or backward it “randomizes”. The second half of the evolution we can interpret as typical Second-Law-style “degradation to randomness”. But what about the first half? Something unexpected is happening here. From what seems like a “rather random” initial state, the system appears to be “spontaneously organizing itself” to produce—at least temporarily—a simple and “orderly” state. An initial “scrambled” state is spontaneously becoming “unscrambled”. In the setup of ordinary thermodynamics, this would be a kind of “anti-thermodynamic” behavior in which what seems like “random heat” is spontaneously generating “organized mechanical work”.</p>\n<p>So why isn’t this what we see happening all the time? Microscopic reversibility guarantees that in principle it’s possible. But what leads to the observed Second Law is that in practice we just don’t normally end up setting up the kind of initial states that give “anti-thermodynamic” behavior. We’ll be talking at length below about why this is. But the basic point is that to do so requires more computational sophistication than we as computationally bounded observers can muster. If the evolution of the system is computationally irreducible, then in effect we have to invert all of that computationally irreducible work to find the initial state to use, and that’s not something that we—as computationally bounded observers—can do. </p>\n<p>But before we talk more about this, let’s explore some of the consequences of the basic setup we have here. The most obvious aspect of the “simple state” in the middle of the picture above is that it involves a big blob of “adjacent particles”. So now here’s a plot of the “size of the biggest blob that’s present” as a function of time starting from the “simple state”:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img51_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img51.png\" alt='' title='' width='373' height='135'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>The plot indicates that—as the picture above indicates—the “specialness” of the initial state quickly “decays” to a “typical state” in which there aren’t any large blobs present. And if we were watching the system at the beginning of this plot, we’d be able to “use the Second Law” to identify a definite “arrow of time”: later times are the ones where the states are “more disordered” in the sense that they only have smaller blobs.</p>\n<p>There are many subtleties to all of this. We know that if we set up an “appropriately special” initial state we can get anti-thermodynamic behavior. And indeed for the whole picture above—with its “special initial state”—the plot of blob size vs. time looks like this, with a symmetrical peak “developing” in the middle:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img52_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img52.png\" alt='' title='' width='529' height='101'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>We’ve “made this happen” by setting up “special initial conditions”. But can it happen “naturally”? To some extent, yes. Even away from the peak, we can see there are always little fluctuations: blobs being formed and destroyed as part of the evolution of the system. And if we wait long enough we may see a fairly large blob. Like here’s one that forms (and decays) after about 245,400 steps:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img53_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img53.png\" alt='' title='' width='373' height='128'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>The actual structure this corresponds to is pretty unremarkable:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img54_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img54.png\" alt='' title='' width='188' height='313'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>But, OK, away from the “special state”, what we see is a kind of “uniform randomness”, in which, for example, there’s no obvious distinction between forward and backward in time. In thermodynamic terms, we’d describe this as having “reached equilibrium”—a situation in which there’s no longer “obvious change”.</p>\n<p>To be fair, even in “equilibrium”, there will always be “fluctuations”. But for example in the system we’re looking at here, “fluctuations” corresponding to progressively larger blobs tend to occur exponentially less frequently. So it’s reasonable to think of there being an “equilibrium state” with certain unchanging “typical properties”. And, what’s more, that state is the basic outcome from any initial condition. Whatever special characteristics might have been present in the initial state will tend to be degraded away, leaving only the generic “equilibrium state”. </p>\n<p>One might think that the possibility of such an “equilibrium state” showing “typical behavior” would be a specific feature of microscopically reversible systems. But this isn’t the case. And much as the core phenomenon of the Second Law is actually something computational that’s deeper and more general than the specifics of particular physical systems, so also this is true of the core phenomenon of equilibrium. And indeed the presence of what we might call “computational equilibrium” turns out to be directly connected to the overall phenomenon of computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>Let’s look again at rule 30.

But the point is that the overall form of what’s produced is always the same: the system has reached a kind of “computational equilibrium” whose overall features are independent of where it came from. Later, we’ll see that the rapid emergence of “computational equilibrium” is characteristic of what I long ago identified as “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-2--four-classes-of-behavior'>class 3 systems</a>”—and it’s quite ubiquitous to systems with a wide range of underlying rules, microscopically reversible or not.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that microscopic reversibility is irrelevant to “Second-Law-like” behavior.

And in the discrete-state systems we’re discussing here the definition of perfect ergodicity is quite straightforward: ergodicity just implies that the state transition graph must consist not of many cycles, but instead purely of one big cycle—so that whatever state one starts from, one’s always guaranteed to eventually visit every possible other state. </p>\n<p>But why is this relevant to the Second Law? Well, we’ve said that the Second Law is about “degradation” from “special states” to “typical states”. And if one’s going to “do the ergodic thing” of visiting all possible states, then inevitably most of the states we’ll at least eventually pass through will be “typical”. </p>\n<p>But on its own, this definitely isn’t enough to explain “Second-Law behavior” in practice. In an example like the following, one sees rapid “degradation” of a simple initial state to something “random” and “typical”: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img77_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img77.png\" alt='' title='' width='108' height='326'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>But of the 2 x 3<sup>80</sup> &asymp; 10<sup>38</sup> possible states that this system would eventually visit if it were ergodic, there are still a huge number that we wouldn’t consider “typical” or “random”. For example, just knowing that the system is eventually ergodic doesn’t tell one that it wouldn’t start off by painstakingly “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p117--elementary-arithmetic/'>counting down</a>” like this, “keeping the action” in a tightly organized region:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img79_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img79.png\" alt='' title='' width='558' height='220'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>So somehow there’s more than ergodicity that’s needed to explain the “degradation to randomness” associated with “typical Second-Law behavior”.

But before we get there, let’s talk some more about “global structure”, as captured by things like state transition diagrams.</p>\n<p>Consider again the size-4 case above. The rules are such that they conserve the number of “particles” (i.e. non-white cells).

One might think that anything that is made by a simple-to-describe algorithm—like the pattern of rule 30 or the digits of π—shouldn’t really be considered “random”. But for the purpose of understanding our experience of the world what matters is not what is “happening underneath” but instead what our perception of it is. So the question becomes: when we see something produced, say by rule 30 or by π, can we <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p547--introduction/'>recognize regularities in it or not</a>?</p>\n<p>And in practice what the Second Law asserts is that systems will tend to go from states where we can recognize regularities to ones where we cannot.

In essence it’s all about seeing if we can find succinct ways to summarize what we see—or at least the aspects of what we see that we care about.

But the issue is whether whatever method we use for compression or for recognizing regularities is able to pick up on this. Or whether somehow the evolution of the system has sufficiently “encoded” the information about the initial condition that it’s no longer detectable. Clearly if our “method of compression” involved explicitly running the evolution of the system backwards, then it’d be possible to pick out the special features of the initial conditions. But explicitly running the evolution of the system requires doing lots of computational work. </p>\n<p>So in a sense the question is whether there’s a shortcut. And, yes, one can try <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>all sorts of methods</a> from <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-9--statistical-analysis'>statistics</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-12--human-thinking'>machine learning</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-10--cryptography-and-cryptanalysis'>cryptography</a> and so on. But so far as one can tell, none of them make any significant progress: the “encoding” associated with the evolution of the system seems to just be too strong to “break”. Ultimately it’s hard to know for sure that there’s no scheme that can work. But any scheme must correspond to running some program. So a way to get a bit more evidence is just to enumerate “possible compression programs” and see what they do. </p>\n<p>In particular, we can for example enumerate simple cellular automata, and see whether when run they produce “obviously different” results. Here’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p597--statistical-analysis/'>what happens for a collection of different cellular automata</a> when they are applied to a “simple initial condition”, to states obtained after 20 and 200 steps of evolution according to the particle cellular automaton rule and to an independently random state: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img110_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img110.png\" alt='' title='' width='572' height='564'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>And, yes, in many cases the simple initial condition leads to “obviously different behavior”.

The fundamental point is that there seems to be enough computational irreducibility in the evolution of the system that no computationally bounded observer can “see through it”. And so—at least as far as a computationally bounded observer is concerned—“specialness” in the initial conditions is quickly “degraded” to an “equilibrium” state that “seems random”.

But soon—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>particularly through work on gases by Boltzmann</a>—there arose a quite different way of computing (and thinking about) entropy: in terms of the log of the number of possible states of a system. Later we’ll discuss the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-entropy'>correspondence between these different ideas of entropy</a>. But for now let’s consider what I view as the more fundamental definition based on counting states.</p>\n<p>In the early days of entropy, when one imagined that—like in the cases of the hard-sphere gas—the parameters of the system were continuous, it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>could be mathematically complex to tease out any kind of discrete &#8220;counting of states&#8221;</a>. But from what we’ve discussed here, it’s clear that the core phenomenon of the Second Law doesn’t depend on the presence of continuous parameters, and in something like a cellular automaton it’s basically straightforward to count discrete states.</p>\n<p>But now we have get more careful about our definition of entropy. Given any particular initial state, a deterministic system will always evolve through a series of individual states—so that there’s always only one possible state for the system, which means the entropy will always be exactly zero. (This is a lot muddier and more complicated when continuous parameters are considered, but in the end the conclusion is the same.) </p>\n<p>So how do we get a more useful definition of entropy? The key idea is to think not about individual states of a system but instead about collections of states that we somehow consider “equivalent”. In a typical case we might imagine that we can’t measure all the detailed positions of molecules in a gas, so we look just at “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p448--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>coarse-grained</a>” states in which we consider, say, only the number of molecules in particular overall bins or blocks.</p>\n<p>The entropy can be thought of as counting the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with some overall constraint—like a certain number of particles in each bin. If the constraint talks specifically about the position of every particle, there’ll only be one microscopic state consistent with the constraints, and the entropy will be zero. But if the constraint is looser, there’ll often be many possible microscopic states consistent with it, and the entropy we define will be nonzero.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at this in the context of our particle cellular automaton. Here’s a particular evolution, starting from a specific microscopic state, together with a sequence of “coarse grainings” of this evolution in which we keep track only of “overall particle density” in progressively larger blocks:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img111_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img111.png\" alt='' title='' width='415' height='227'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>The very first “coarse graining” here is particularly trivial: all it’s doing is to say whether a “particle is present” or not in each cell—or, in other words, it’s showing every particle but ignoring whether it’s “light” or “dark”.

Say we look at the “particle-or-not” case. At a coarse-grained level the initial condition just says there are 6 particles present. But it doesn’t say if each particle is light or dark, and actually there are 2<sup>6</sup> = 64 possible microscopic configurations.

Or, in other words, the number of possible states of the system consistent with a particular coarse-grained initial condition increases, corresponding to an increase in what one can consider to be the entropy of the system.</p>\n<p>There are many possible ways to set up what we might view as “coarse graining”. An example of another possibility is to focus on the values of a particular block of cells, and then to ignore the values of all other cells. But it typically doesn’t take long for the effects of other cells to “seep into” the block we’re looking at:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img122_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img122.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='160'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>So what is the bigger picture? The basic point is that insofar as the evolution of each individual microscopic state “leads to randomness”, it’ll tend to end up in a different “coarse-grained bin”. And the result is that even if one starts with a tightly defined coarse-grained description, it’ll inevitably tend to “spread out”, thereby encompassing more states and increasing the entropy.</p>\n<p>In a sense, looking at entropy and coarse graining is just a less direct way to detect that a system tends to “produce effective randomness”. And while it may have seemed like a convenient formalism when one was, for example, trying to tease things out from systems with continuous variables, it now feels like a rather indirect way to get at the core phenomenon of the Second Law. </p>\n<p>It’s useful to understand a few more connections, however. Let’s say one’s trying to work out the average value of something (say particle density) in a system. What do we mean by “average”? One possibility is that we take an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>&#8220;ensemble&#8221; of possible states</a> of the system, then find the average across these. But another possibility is that we instead look at the average across successive states in the evolution of the system. The “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-ergodicity'>ergodic hypothesis</a>” is that the ensemble average will be the same as the time average.</p>\n<p>One way this would—at least eventually—be guaranteed is if the evolution of the system is ergodic, in the sense that it eventually visits all possible states. But as we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>saw above</a>, this isn’t something that’s particularly plausible for most systems. But it also isn’t necessary. Because so long as the evolution of the system is “effectively random” enough, it’ll quickly “sample typical states”, and give essentially the same averages as one would get from sampling all possible states, but without having to laboriously visit all these states.</p>\n<p>How does one tie all this down with rigorous, mathematical-style proofs? Well, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>it&#8217;s difficult</a>. And in a first approximation <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#so-where-does-this-leave-the-second-law?'>not much progress has been made on this for more than a century</a>. But having seen that the core phenomenon of the Second Law can be reduced to an essentially purely computational statement, we’re now in a position to examine this in a different—and I think ultimately very clarifying—way.</p>\n<h2 id='why-the-second-law-works'>Why the Second Law Works</h2>\n<p>At its core the Second Law is essentially the statement that “things tend to get more random”. And in a sense the ultimate driver of this is the surprising <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>phenomenon of computational irreducibility</a> I identified in the 1980s—and the remarkable fact that even from simple initial conditions simple computational rules <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>can generate behavior of great complexity</a>. But there are definitely additional nuances to the story.</p>\n<p>For example, we’ve seen that—particularly in a reversible system—it’s always in principle possible to set up initial conditions that will evolve to “magically produce” whatever “simple” configuration we want. And when we say that we generate “apparently random” states, our “analyzer of randomness” can’t go in and invert the computational process that generated the states. Similarly, when we talk about coarse-grained entropy and its increase, we’re assuming that we’re not inventing some elaborate coarse-graining procedure that’s specially set up to pick out collections of states with “special” behavior.</p>\n<p>But there’s really just one principle that governs all these things: that whatever method we have to prepare or analyze states of a system is somehow computationally bounded. This isn’t as such a statement of physics. Rather, it’s a general <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>statement about observers</a>, or, more specifically, observers like us.</p>\n<p>We could imagine some very detailed model for an observer, or for the experimental apparatus they use. But the key point is that the details don’t matter. Really all that matters is that the observer is computationally bounded. And it’s then the basic computational mismatch between the observer and the computational irreducibility of the underlying system that leads us to “experience” the Second Law.</p>\n<p>At a theoretical level we can imagine an “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad'>alien observer</a>”—or even an observer with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>technology</a> from our own future—that would not have the same computational limitations. But the point is that insofar as we are interested in explaining our own current experience, and our own current scientific observations, what matters is the way we as observers are now, with all our computational boundedness. And it’s then the interplay between this computational boundedness, and the phenomenon of computational irreducibility, that leads to our basic experience of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>At some level the Second Law is a story of the emergence of complexity. But it’s also a story of the emergence of simplicity. For the very statement that things go to a “completely random equilibrium” implies great simplification. Yes, if an observer could look at all the details they would see great complexity. But the point is that a computationally bounded observer necessarily can’t look at those details, and instead the features they identify have a certain simplicity.</p>\n<p>And so it is, for example, that even though in a gas there are complicated underlying molecular motions, it’s still true that at an overall level a computationally bounded observer can meaningfully discuss the gas—and make predictions about its behavior—purely in terms of things like pressure and temperature that don’t probe the underlying details of molecular motions.</p>\n<p>In the past one might have thought that anything like the Second Law must somehow be specific to systems made from things like interacting particles. But in fact the core phenomenon of the Second Law is much more general, and in a sense purely computational, depending only on the basic computational phenomenon of computational irreducibility, together with the fundamental computational boundedness of observers like us.</p>\n<p>And given this generality it’s perhaps not surprising that the core phenomenon appears far beyond where anything like the Second Law has normally been considered. In particular, in our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> it now emerges as fundamental to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>structure of space itself</a>—as well as to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>phenomenon of quantum mechanics</a>. For in our Physics Project we imagine that at the lowest level everything in our universe can be represented by some essentially computational structure, conveniently described as a hypergraph whose nodes are abstract “atoms of space”. This structure evolves by following rules, whose operation will typically show all sorts of computational irreducibility. But now the question is how observers like us will perceive all this. And the point is that through our limitations we inevitably come to various “aggregate” conclusions about what’s going on. It’s very much like with the gas laws and their broad applicability to systems involving different kinds of molecules. Except that now the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-gravity'>emergent laws are about spacetime</a> and correspond to the equations of General Relativity. </p>\n<p>But the basic intellectual structure is the same. Except that in the case of spacetime, there’s an additional complication. In thermodynamics, we can imagine that there’s a system we’re studying, and the observer is outside it, “looking in”. But when we’re thinking about spacetime, the observer is necessarily embedded within it. And it turns out that there’s then one additional feature of observers like us that’s important. Beyond the statement that we’re computationally bounded, it’s also important that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>we assume that we&#8217;re persistent in time</a>. Yes, we’re made of different atoms of space at different moments. But somehow we assume that we have a coherent thread of experience. And this is crucial in deriving our familiar laws of physics.</p>\n<p>We’ll talk more about it later, but in our Physics Project the same underlying setup is also what leads to the laws of quantum mechanics. Of course, quantum mechanics is notable for the apparent randomness associated with observations made in it. And what we’ll see later is that in the end the same core phenomenon responsible for randomness in the Second Law also appears to be what’s responsible for randomness in quantum mechanics. </p>\n<p>The interplay between computational irreducibility and computational limitations of observers turns out to be a central phenomenon throughout the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> and its many emerging applications. It’s core to the fact that observers can experience computationally reducible laws in all sorts of samplings of the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a>. And in a sense all of this strengthens the story of the origins of the Second Law. Because it shows that what might have seemed like arbitrary features of observers are actually deep and general, transcending a vast range of areas and applications.</p>\n<p>But even given the robustness of features of observers, we can still ask about the origins of the whole computational phenomenon that leads to the Second Law. Ultimately it begins with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>, which asserts that systems whose behavior is not obviously simple will tend to be equivalent in their computational sophistication. The Principle of Computational Equivalence has many implications. One of them is computational irreducibility, associated with the fact that “analyzers” or “predictors” of a system cannot be expected to have any greater computational sophistication than the system itself, and so are reduced to just tracing each step in the evolution of a system to find out what it does.</p>\n<p>Another implication of the Principle of Computational Equivalence is the ubiquity of computation universality. And this is something we can expect to see “underneath” the Second Law. Because we can expect that systems like the particle cellular automaton—or, for that matter, the hard-sphere gas—will be provably capable of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p637--computation-as-a-framework/'>universal computation</a>. Already it’s easy to see that simple logic gates can be constructed from configurations of particles, but a full demonstration of computation universality will be considerably more elaborate. And while it’d be nice to have such a demonstration, there’s still more that’s needed to establish full computational irreducibility of the kind the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies.</p>\n<p>As we’ve seen, there are a variety of “indicators” of the operation of the Second Law. Some are based on looking for randomness or compression in individual states. Others are based on computing coarse grainings and entropy measures. But with the computational interpretation of the Second Law we can expect to translate such indicators into questions in areas like computational complexity theory.</p>\n<p>At some level we can think of the Second Law as being a consequence of the dynamics of a system so “encrypting” the initial conditions of a system that no computations available to an “observer” can feasibly “decrypt” it. And indeed as soon as one looks at “inverting” coarse-grained results one is immediately faced with fairly <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--np-completeness/'>classic NP problems</a> from computational complexity theory. (Establishing NP completeness in a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p767--undecidability-and-intractability/'>particular case remains challenging</a>, just like establishing computation universality.) </p>\n<h2 id='textbook-thermodynamics'>Textbook Thermodynamics</h2>\n<p>In our discussion here, we’ve treated the Second Law of thermodynamics primarily as an abstract computational phenomenon. But when thermodynamics was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-second-law-is-formulated'>historically first being developed</a>, the computational paradigm was still far in the future, and the only way to identify something like the Second Law was through its manifestations in terms of physical concepts like heat and temperature.</p>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>First Law of thermodynamics</a> asserted that heat was a form of energy, and that overall energy was conserved. The Second Law then tried to characterize the nature of the energy associated with heat. And a core idea was that this energy was somehow incoherently spread among a large number of separate microscopic components. But ultimately thermodynamics was always a story of energy.</p>\n<p>But is energy really a core feature of thermodynamics or is it merely “scaffolding” relevant for its historical development and early practical applications? In the hard-sphere gas example that we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-mystery-of-the-second-law' >started from above</a>, there’s a pretty clear notion of energy. But quite soon we largely abstracted energy away. Though in our particle cellular automaton we do still have something somewhat analogous to energy conservation: we have <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-4--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena'>conservation of the number of non-white cells</a>. </p>\n<p>In a traditional physical system like a gas, temperature gives the average energy per degree of freedom. But in something like our particle cellular automaton, we’re effectively assuming that all particles always have the same energy—so there is for example no way to “change the temperature”. Or, put another way, what we might consider as the energy of the system is basically just given by the number of particles in the system.</p>\n<p>Does this simplification affect the core phenomenon of the Second Law? No. That’s something much stronger, and quite independent of these details. But in the effort to make contact with recognizable “textbook thermodynamics”, it’s useful to consider how we’d add in ideas like heat and temperature.</p>\n<p>In our discussion of the Second Law, we’ve identified entropy with the log of the number states consistent with a constraint. But more traditional thermodynamics involves formulas like <nobr><em>dS</em> = <em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em></nobr>. And it’s not hard to see at least roughly where this formula comes from. <em>Q</em> gives total heat content, or “total heat energy” (not worrying about what this is measured relative to, which is what makes it <em>dQ</em> rather than <em>Q</em>). <em>T</em> gives average energy per “degree of freedom” (or, roughly, particle). And this means that <em>Q</em>/<em>T</em> effectively measures something like the “number of particles”. But at least in a system like a particle cellular automaton, the number of possible complete configurations is exponential in the number of particles, making its logarithm, the entropy <em>S</em>, roughly proportional to the number of particles, and thus to <em>Q</em>/<em>T</em>. That anything like this argument works depends, though, on being able to discuss things “statistically”, which in turn depends on the core phenomenon of the Second Law: the tendency of things to evolve to uniform (“equilibrium”) randomness.</p>\n<p>When the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>Second Law was first introduced</a>, there were several formulations given, all initially referencing energy. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-second-law-is-formulated'>One formulation stated</a> that &#8220;heat does not spontaneously go from a colder body to a hotter”. And even in our particle cellular automaton we can see a fairly direct version of this. Our proxy for &#8220;temperature&#8221; is density of particles. And what we observe is that an initial region of higher density <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p464--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena/'>tends to &#8220;diffuse&#8221; out</a>:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img125_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img125.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='220'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Another formulation of the Second Law talks about the impossibility of systematically “turning heat into mechanical work”. At a computational level, the analog of “mechanical work” is systematic, predictable behavior. So what this is saying is again that systems tend to generate randomness, and to “remove predictability”. </p>\n<p>In a sense this is a direct reflection of computational irreducibility. To get something that one can “harness as mechanical work” one needs something that one can readily predict. But the whole point is that the presence of computational irreducibility makes prediction take an irreducible amount of computational work—that is beyond the capabilities of an “observer like us”.</p>\n<p>Closely related is the statement that it’s not possible to make a perpetual motion machine (“of the second kind”, i.e. violating the Second Law), that continually “makes systematic motion” from “heat”. In our computational setting this would be like extracting a systematic, predictable sequence of bits from our particle cellular automaton, or from something like rule 30. And, yes, if we had a device that could for example <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes/'>systematically predict rule 30</a>, then it would be straightforward, say, “just to pick out black cells”, and effectively to derive a predictable sequence. But computational irreducibility implies that we won’t be able to do this, without effectively just directly reproducing what rule 30 does, which an “observer like us” doesn’t have the computational capability to do.</p>\n<p>Much of the textbook discussion of thermodynamics is centered around the assumption of “equilibrium”—or something infinitesimally close to it—in which one assumes that a system behaves “uniformly and randomly”. Indeed, the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics is essentially the statement that “statistically unique” equilibrium can be achieved, which in terms of energy becomes a statement that there is a unique notion of temperature.</p>\n<p>Once one has the idea of “equilibrium”, one can then start to think of its properties as purely being functions of certain parameters—and this opens up all sorts of calculus-based mathematical opportunities. That anything like this makes sense depends, however, yet again on “perfect randomness as far as the observer is concerned”. Because if the observer could notice a difference between different configurations, it wouldn’t be possible to treat all of them as just being “in the equilibrium state”. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, while the intuition of all this is made rather clear by our computational view, there are details to be filled in when it comes to any particular mathematical formulation of features of thermodynamics. As one example, let’s consider a core result of traditional thermodynamics: the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>Maxwell–Boltzmann exponential distribution of energies</a> for individual particles or other degrees of freedom.</p>\n<p>To set up a discussion of this, we need to have a system where there can be many possible microscopic amounts of energy, say, associated with some kind of idealized particles. Then we imagine that in “collisions” between such particles energy is exchanged, but the total is always conserved. And the question is how energy will eventually be distributed among the particles. </p>\n<p>As a first example, let’s imagine that we have a collection of particles which evolve in a series of steps, and that at each step particles are paired up at random to “collide”. And, further, let’s assume that the effect of the collision is to randomly redistribute energy between the particles, say with a uniform distribution. </p>\n<p>We can represent this process using a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graph</a>, where the events (indicated here in yellow) are the collisions, and the tokens (indicated here in red) represent states of particles at each step.

Such books also tend to talk about things like tradeoffs between energy and entropy, and define things like the (Helmholtz) free energy <em>F</em> = <em>U</em> – <em>T</em> <em>S</em> (where <em>U</em> is internal energy, <em>T</em> is temperature and <em>S</em> is entropy) that are used in answering questions like whether particular chemical reactions will occur under certain conditions. </p>\n<p>But given our discussion of energy here, and our earlier discussion of entropy, it&#8217;s at first quite unclear how these quantities might relate, and how they can trade off against each other, say in the formula for free energy. But in some sense what connects energy to the standard definition of entropy in terms of the logarithm of the number of states is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, with its exponential form. In the usual physical setup, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is basically <em>e</em><sup>(–<em>E</em>/<em>kT</em>)</sup>, where <em>T</em> is the temperature, and <em>kT</em> is the average energy. </p>\n<p>But now imagine we’re trying to figure out whether some process—say a chemical reaction—will happen. If there’s an energy barrier, say associated with an energy difference Δ, then according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution there’ll be a probability proportional to <em>e</em><sup>(–Δ/<em>kT</em>)</sup> for molecules to have a high enough energy to surmount that barrier. But the next question is how many configurations of molecules there are in which molecules will “try to surmount the barrier”. And that’s where the entropy comes in. Because if the number of possible configurations is Ω, the entropy <em>S</em> is given by <em>k</em> log Ω, so that in terms of <em>S</em>, Ω = <em>e</em><sup>(<em>S</em>/<em>k</em>)</sup>. But now the “average number of molecules which will surmount the barrier” is roughly given by <nobr><em>e</em><sup>(<em>S</em>/<em>k</em>)</sup> <em>e</em><sup>(–Δ/<em>kT</em>)</sup>,</nobr> so that in the end the exponent is proportional to Δ – <em>T S</em>, which has the form of the free energy <em>U</em> – <em>T</em> <em>S</em>.</p>\n<p>This argument is quite rough, but it captures the essence of what’s going on. And at first it might seem like a remarkable coincidence that there’s a logarithm in the definition of entropy that just “conveniently fits together” like this with the exponential in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. But it’s actually not a coincidence at all. The point is that what’s really fundamental is the concept of counting the number of possible states of a system. But typically this number is extremely large. And we need some way to “tame” it. We could in principle use some slow-growing function other than log to do this. But if we use log (as in the standard definition of entropy) we precisely get the tradeoff with energy in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.</p>\n<p>There is also another convenient feature of using log. If two systems are independent, one with Ω<sub>1</sub> states, and the other with Ω<sub>2</sub> states, then a system that combines these (without interaction) will have Ω<sub>1</sub>, Ω<sub>2</sub> states. And if <em>S</em> = <em>k</em> log Ω, then this means that the entropy of the combined state will just be the sum <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> of the entropies of the individual states. But is this fact actually “fundamentally independent” of the exponential character of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution? Well, no. Or at least it comes from the same mathematical idea. Because it’s the fact that in equilibrium the probability &fnof;(<em>E</em>) is supposed to satisfy &fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>1</sub>)&fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>2</sub>) = &fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>3</sub>)&fnof;(<em>E</em><sub>4</sub>) when <em>E</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>E</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>E</em><sub>3</sub> + <em>E</em><sub>4</sub> that makes &fnof;(<em>E</em>) have its exponential form. In other words, both stories are about exponentials being able to connect additive combination of one quantity with multiplicative combination of another.</p>\n<p>Having said all this, though, it’s important to understand that you don’t need energy to talk about entropy. The concept of entropy, as we’ve discussed, is ultimately a computational concept, quite independent of physical notions like energy. In many textbook treatments of thermodynamics, energy and entropy are in some sense put on a similar footing. The First Law is about energy. The Second Law is about entropy. But what we’ve seen here is that energy is really a concept at a different level from entropy: it’s something one gets to “layer on” in discussing physical systems, but it’s not a necessary part of the “computational essence” of how things work.</p>\n<p>(As an extra wrinkle, in the case of our Physics Project—as to some extent in traditional general relativity and quantum mechanics—there are some fundamental connections between energy and entropy. In particular—related to what we’ll discuss below—the number of possible discrete configurations of spacetime is inevitably related to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>&#8220;density&#8221; of events, which defines energy</a>.)</p>\n<h2 id='towards-a-formal-proof-of-the-second-law'>Towards a Formal Proof of the Second Law</h2>\n<p>It would be nice to be able to say, for example, that “using computation theory, we can prove the Second Law”. But it isn’t as simple as that. Not least because, as we’ve seen, the validity of the Second Law depends on things like what “observers like us” are capable of. But we can, for example, formulate what the outline of a proof of the Second Law could be like, though to give a full formal proof we’d have to introduce a variety of “axioms” (<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>essentially about observers</a>) that don’t have immediate foundations in existing areas of mathematics, physics or computation theory.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that one imagines a state <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span> of a system (which could just be a sequence of values for cells in something like a cellular automaton). One considers an “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis#sect-10-2--what-perception-and-analysis-do'>observer function</a>” Θ which, when applied to the state <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>, gives a “summary” of <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>. (A very simple example would be the run-length encoding that we used above.) Now we imagine some “evolution function” Ξ that is applied to <span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>. The basic claim of the Second Law is that the “sizes” normally satisfy the inequality Θ[Ξ[<span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>]] ≥ Θ[<span style=\"font-family: cursive\"><em>S</em></span>], or in other words, that “compression by the observer” is less effective after the evolution of system, in effect because the state of the system has “become more random”, as our informal statement of the Second Law suggests.</p>\n<p>What are the possible forms of Θ and Ξ? It’s slightly easier to talk about Ξ, because we imagine that this is basically any not-obviously-trivial computation, run for an increasing number of steps. It could be repeated application of a cellular automaton rule, or a Turing machine, or any other computational system. We might represent an individual step by an operator <em>ξ</em>, and say that in effect Ξ = <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>. We can always construct <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup> by explicitly applying <em>ξ</em> successively <em>t</em> times. But the question of computational irreducibility is whether there’s a shortcut way to get to the same result. And given any specific representation of <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup> (say, rather prosaically, as a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--lower-bounds-on-computational-complexity/'>Boolean circuit</a>), we can ask how the size of that representation grows with <em>t</em>.</p>\n<p>With the current state of computation theory, it’s exceptionally difficult to get definitive general results about minimal sizes of <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>, though in sufficiently small cases it’s possible to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p761--undecidability-and-intractability/'>determine this &#8220;experimentally&#8221;</a>, essentially by exhaustive search. But there’s an increasing amount of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes/'>at least circumstantial evidence</a> that for many kinds of systems, one can’t do much better than explicitly constructing <em>ξ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>, as the phenomenon of computational irreducibility suggests. (One can imagine “toy models”, in which <em>ξ</em> corresponds to some very simple computational process—like a finite automaton—but while this likely allows one to prove things, it’s not at all clear how useful or representative any of the results will be.)</p>\n<p>OK, so what about the “observer function” Θ? For this we need some kind of “observer theory”, that characterizes what observers—or, at least “observers like us”—can do, in the same kind of way that standard computation theory characterizes what computational systems can do. There are clearly some features Θ must have. For example, it can’t involve unbounded amounts of computation. But realistically there’s more than that. Somehow the role of observers is to take all the details that might exist in the “outside world”, and reduce or compress these to some “smaller” representation that can “fit in the mind of the observer”, and allow the observer to “make decisions” that abstract from the details of the outside world whatever specifics the observer “cares about”. And—like a construction such as a Turing machine—one must in the end have some way of building up “possible observers” from something like basic primitives.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, even given primitives—or an axiomatic foundation—for Ξ and Θ, things are not straightforward. For example, it’s basically inevitable that many specific questions one might ask will turn out to be formally undecidable. And we can’t expect (particularly as we’ll see later) that we’ll be able to show that the Second Law is “just true”. It’ll be a statement that necessarily involves qualifiers like “typically”. And if we ask to characterize “typically” in terms, say, of “probabilities”, we’ll be stuck in a kind of recursive situation of having to define probability measures in terms of the very same constructs we’re starting from.</p>\n<p>But despite these difficulties in making what one might characterize as general abstract statements, what our computational formulation achieves is to provide a clear intuitive guide to the origin of the Second Law. And from this we can in particular construct an infinite range of specific computational experiments that illustrate the core phenomenon of the Second Law, and give us more and more understanding of how the Second Law works, and where it conceptually comes from.</p>\n<h2 id='maxwell&rsquo;s-demon-and-the-character-of-observers'>Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon and the Character of Observers</h2>\n<p>Even in the very early years of the formulation of the Second Law, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=james+clerk+maxwell'>James Clerk Maxwell</a> already <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#maxwell%E2%80%99s-demon'>brought up an objection to its general applicability</a>, and to the idea that systems “always become more random”. He imagined that a box containing gas molecules had a barrier in the middle with a small door controlled by a “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1021a/'>demon</a>” who could decide on a molecule-by-molecule basis which molecules to let through in each direction. Maxwell suggested that such a demon should readily be able to “sort” molecules, thereby reversing any “randomness” that might be developing.</p>\n<p>As a very simple example, imagine that at the center of our particle cellular automaton we insert a barrier that lets particles pass from left to right but not the reverse.

Meanwhile, all kinds of objections to their successful operation have been raised. “The demon can’t be made small enough”; “The demon will heat up and stop working”; “The demon will need to reset its memory, so has to be fundamentally irreversible”; “The demon will inevitably randomize things when it tries to sense molecules”; etc. </p>\n<p>So what’s true? It depends on what we assume about the demon—and in particular to what extent we suppose that the demon needs to be following the same underlying laws as the system it’s operating on. As a somewhat extreme example, let’s imagine trying to “make a demon out of gas molecules”. Here’s an attempt at a simple model of this in our particle cellular automaton: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img174_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img174.png\" alt='' title='' width='575' height='203'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>For a while we successfully maintain a “barrier”. But eventually the barrier succumbs to the same “degradation” processes as everything else, and melts away. Can we do better? </p>\n<p>Let’s imagine that “inside the barrier” (AKA “demon”) there’s “machinery” that whenever the barrier is “buffeted” in a given way “puts up the right kind of armor” to “protect it” from that kind of buffeting. Assuming our underlying system is for example computation universal, we should at some level be able to “implement any computation we want”. (What needs to be done is quite analogous to cellular automata that successfully <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/#cellular-automata-with-noise'>erase up to finite levels of &#8220;noise&#8221;</a>.) </p>\n<p>But there’s a problem. In order to “protect the barrier” we have to be able to “predict” how it will be “attacked”. Or, in other words, our barrier (or demon) will have to be able to systematically determine what the outside system is going to do before it does it. But if the behavior of the outside system is computationally irreducible this won’t in general be possible. So in the end the criterion for a demon like this to be impossible is essentially the same as the criterion for Second Law behavior to occur in the first place: that the system we’re looking at is computationally irreducible.</p>\n<p>There’s a bit more to say about this, though. We’ve been talking about a demon that’s trying to “achieve something fairly simple”, like maintaining a barrier or a “one-way membrane”. But what if we’re more flexible in what we consider the objective of the demon to be? And even if the demon can’t achieve our original “simple objective” might there at least be some kind of “useful sorting” that it can do?</p>\n<p>Well, that depends on what we imagine constitutes “useful sorting”. The system is always following its rules to do something. But probably it’s not something we consider “useful sorting”. But what would count as “useful sorting”? Presumably it’s got to be something that an observer will “notice”, and more than that, it should be something that has “done some of the job of decision making” ahead of the observer. In principle a sufficiently powerful observer might be able to “look inside the gas” and see what the results of some elaborate sorting procedure would be. But the point is for the demon to just make the sorting happen, so the job of the observer becomes essentially trivial.</p>\n<p>But all of this then comes back to the question of what kind of thing an observer might want to observe. In general one would like to be able to characterize this by having an “observer theory” that provides a metatheory of possible observers in something like the kind of way that computation theory and ideas like Turing machines provide a metatheory of possible computational systems.</p>\n<p>So what really is an observer, or at least an observer like us? The most crucial feature seems to be that the observer is always ultimately some kind of “finite mind” that takes all the complexity of the world and extracts from it just certain “summary features” that are relevant to the “decisions” it has to make. (Another crucial feature seems to be that the observer can consistently view themselves as being “persistent”.) But we don’t have to go all the way to a sophisticated “mind” to see this picture in operation. Because it’s already what’s going on not only in something like perception but also in essentially anything we’d usually call “measurement”.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine we have a gas containing lots of molecules. A standard measurement might be to find the pressure of the gas. And in doing such a measurement, what’s happening is that we’re reducing the information about all the detailed motions of individual molecules, and just summarizing it by a single aggregate number that is the pressure. </p>\n<p>How do we achieve this? We might have a piston connected to the box of gas. And each time a molecule hits the piston it’ll push it a little. But the point is that in the end the piston moves only as a whole. And the effects of all the individual molecules are aggregated into that overall motion. </p>\n<p>At a microscopic level, any actual physical piston is presumably also made out of molecules. But unlike the molecules in the gas, these molecules are tightly bound together to make the piston solid. Every time a gas molecule hits the surface of the piston, it’ll transfer some momentum to a molecule in the piston, and there’ll be some kind of tiny deformation wave that goes through the piston. To get a “definitive pressure measurement”—based on definitive motion of the piston as a whole—that deformation wave will somehow have to disappear. And in making a theory of the “piston as observer” we’ll typically ignore the physical details, and idealize things by saying that the piston moves only as a whole.</p>\n<p>But ultimately if we were to just look at the system “dispassionately”, without knowing the “intent” of the piston, we’d just see a bunch of molecules in the gas, and a bunch of molecules in the piston. So how would we tell that the piston is “acting as an observer”? In some ways it’s a rather circular story. If we assume that there’s a particular kind of thing an observer wants to measure, then we can potentially identify parts of a system that “achieve that measurement”. But in the abstract we don’t know what an observer “wants to measure”. We’ll always see one part of a system affecting another. But is it “achieving measurement” or not?</p>\n<p>To resolve this, we have to have some kind of metatheory of the observer: we have to be able to say what kinds of things we’re going to count as observers and what not. And ultimately that’s something that must inevitably devolve to a rather human question. Because in the end what we care about is what we humans sense about the world, which is what, for example, we try to construct science about. </p>\n<p>We could talk very specifically about the sensory apparatus that we humans have—or that we’ve built with technology. But the essence of observer theory should presumably be some kind of generalization of that. Something that recognizes fundamental features—like computational boundedness—of us as entities, but that does not depend on the fact that we happen to use sight rather than smell as our most important sense.</p>\n<p>The situation is a bit like the early development of computation theory. Something like a Turing machine was intended to define a mechanism that roughly mirrored the computational capabilities of the human mind, but that also provided a “reasonable generalization” that covered, for example, machines one could imagine building. Of course, in that particular case the definition that was developed proved extremely useful, being, it seems, of just the right generality to cover computations that can occur in our universe—but not beyond. </p>\n<p>And one might hope that in the future observer theory would identify a similarly useful definition for what a “reasonable observer” can be. And given such a definition, we will, for example, be in position to further tighten up our characterization of what the Second Law might say.</p>\n<p>It may be worth commenting that in thinking about an observer as being an “entity like us” one of the immediate attributes we might seek is that the observer should have some kind of “inner experience”. But if we’re just looking at the pattern of molecules in a system, how do we tell where there’s an “inner experience” happening? From the outside, we presumably ultimately can’t. And it’s really only possible when we’re “on the inside”. We might have scientific criteria that tell us whether something can reasonably support an inner experience. But to know if there actually is an inner experience “going on” we basically have to be experiencing it. We can’t make a “first-principles” objective theory; we just have to posit that such-and-such part of the system is representing our subjective experience.</p>\n<p>Of course, that doesn’t mean that there can’t still be very general conclusions to be drawn. Because it can still be—as it is in our Physics Project and in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>thinking about the ruliad</a>—that it takes knowing only rather basic features of “observers like us” to be able to make very general statements about things like the effective laws we will experience.</p>\n<h2 id='the-heat-death-of-the-universe'>The Heat Death of the Universe</h2>\n<p>It <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-second-law-is-formulated'>didn&#8217;t take long after the Second Law was first proposed</a> for people to start talking about its implications for the long-term evolution of the universe. If “randomness” (for example as characterized by entropy) always increases, doesn’t that mean that the universe must eventually evolve to a state of “equilibrium randomness”, in which all the rich structures we now see have decayed into “random heat”?</p>\n<p>There are several issues here. But the most obvious has to do with what observer one imagines will be experiencing that future state of the universe. After all, if the underlying rules which govern the universe are reversible, then in principle it will always be possible to go back from that future “random heat” and reconstruct from it all the rich structures that have existed in the history of the universe.</p>\n<p>But the point of the Second Law as we’ve discussed it is that at least for computationally bounded observers like us that won’t be possible. The past will always in principle be determinable from the future, but it will take irreducibly much computation to do so—and vastly more than observers like us can muster.</p>\n<p>And along the same lines, if observers like us examine the future state of the universe we won’t be able to see that there’s anything special about it. Even though it came from the “special state” that is the current state of our universe, we won’t be able to tell it from a “typical” state, and we’ll just consider it “random”.</p>\n<p>But what if the observers evolve with the evolution of the universe? Yes, to us today that future configuration of particles may just “look random”. But in actuality, it has rich computational content that there’s no reason to assume a future observer will not find in some way or another significant. Indeed, in a sense the longer the universe has been around, the larger the amount of irreducible computation it will have done. And, yes, observers like us today might not care about most of what comes out of that computation. But in principle there are features of it that could be mined to inform the “experience” of future observers.</p>\n<p>At a practical level, our basic human senses pick out certain features on certain scales. But as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/'>technology progresses</a>, it gives us ways to pick out much more, on much finer scales. A century ago we couldn’t realistically pick out individual atoms or individual photons; now we routinely can. And what seemed like “random noise” just a few decades ago is now often known to have specific, detailed structure. </p>\n<p>There is, however, a complex tradeoff. A crucial feature of observers like us is that there is a certain coherence to our experience; we sample little enough about the world that we’re able to turn it into a coherent thread of experience. But the more an observer samples, the more difficult this will become. So, yes, a future observer with vastly more advanced technology might successfully be able to sample lots of details of the future universe. But to do that, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>the observer will have to lose some of their own coherence</a>, and ultimately we won’t even be able to identify that future observer as “coherently existing” at all.</p>\n<p>The usual “heat death of the universe” refers to the fate of matter and other particles in the universe. But what about things like gravity and the structure of spacetime? In traditional physics, that’s been a fairly separate question. But in our Physics Project everything is ultimately described in terms of a single abstract structure that represents both space and everything in it. And we can expect that the evolution of this whole structure then corresponds to a computationally irreducible process.</p>\n<p>The basic setup is at its core just like what we’ve seen in our general discussion of the Second Law. But here we’re operating at the lowest level of the universe, so the irreducible progression of computation can be thought of as representing the fundamental inexorable passage of time. As time moves forward, therefore, we can generally expect “more randomness” in the lowest-level structure of the universe.</p>\n<p>But what will observers perceive? There’s considerable trickiness here—particularly in connection with quantum mechanics—that we’ll discuss later. In essence, the point is that there are many paths of history for the universe, that branch and merge—and observers sample certain collections of paths. And for example on some paths the computations may simply halt, with no further rules applying—so that in effect “time stops”, at least for observers on those paths. It’s a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>phenomenon that can be identified with spacetime singularities</a>, and with what happens inside (at least certain) black holes.</p>\n<p>So does this mean that the universe might “just stop”, in effect ending with a collection of black holes? It’s more complicated than that. Because there are always other paths for observers to follow. Some correspond to different quantum possibilities. But ultimately what we imagine is that our perception of the universe is a sampling from the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad—the limiting entangled structure formed by running all abstractly possible computations forever</a>. And it’s a feature of the construction of the ruliad that it’s infinite. Individual paths in it can halt, but the whole ruliad goes on forever. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean about the ultimate fate of the universe? Much like the situation with heat death, specific observers may conclude that “nothing interesting is happening anymore”. But something always will be happening, and in fact that something will represent the accumulation of larger and larger amounts of irreducible computation. It won’t be possible for an observer to encompass all this while still themselves “remaining coherent”. But as we’ll discuss later there will inexorably be pockets of computational reducibility for which coherent observers can exist, although what those observers will perceive is likely to be utterly incoherent with anything that we as observers now perceive. </p>\n<p>The universe does not fundamentally just “descend into randomness”. And indeed all the things that exist in our universe today will ultimately be encoded in some way forever in the detailed structure that develops. But what the core phenomenon of the Second Law suggests is that at least many aspects of that encoding will not be accessible to observers like us. The future of the universe will transcend what we so far “appreciate”, and will require a redefinition of what we consider meaningful. But it should not be “taken for dead” or dismissed as being just “random heat”. It’s just that to find what we consider interesting, we may in effect have to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#reaching-out-across-rulial-space'>migrate across the ruliad</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='traces-of-initial-conditions'>Traces of Initial Conditions</h2>\n<p>The Second Law gives us the expectation that so long as we start from “reasonable” initial conditions, we should always evolve to some kind of “uniformly random” configuration that we can view as a “unique equilibrium state” that’s “lost any meaningful memory” of the initial conditions. But now that we’ve got ways to explore the Second Law in specific, simple computational systems, we can explicitly study the extent to which this expectation is upheld. And what we’ll find is that even though as a general matter it is, there can still be exceptions in which traces of initial conditions can be preserved at least long into the evolution. </p>\n<p>Let’s look again at our “particle cellular automaton” system. We saw above that the evolution of an initial “blob” (here of size 17 in a system with 30 cells) leads to configurations that typically look quite random:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img175_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img175.png\" alt='' title='' width='557' height='272'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>But what about other initial conditions?

Essentially the point is that even though something like our particle cellular automaton exhibits computational irreducibility and often generates “featureless” apparent randomness, a system like this is also capable of exhibiting computational reducibility in which traces of the initial conditions can persist, and there isn’t just “generic randomness generation”.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility is a powerful force. But, as we’ll discuss below, its very presence implies that there must inevitably also be “pockets” of computational reducibility. And once again (as we’ll discuss below) it’s a question of the observer how obvious or not these pockets may be in a particular case, and whether—say for observers like us—they affect what we perceive in terms of the operation of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>It’s worth commenting that such issues are not just a feature of systems like our particle cellular automaton. And indeed they’ve appeared—stretching all the way back to the 1950s—pretty much whenever <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>detailed simulations have been done</a> of systems that one might expect would show “Second Law” behavior. The story is typically that, yes, there is apparent randomness generated (though it’s often barely studied as such), just as the Second Law would suggest. But then there’s a big surprise of some kind of unexpected regularity. In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-3--history-of-thermodynamics/'>arrays of nonlinear springs</a>, there were solitons. In <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>hard-sphere gases</a>, there were “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-999d/'>long-time tails</a>”—in which correlations in the motion of spheres were seen to decay not exponentially in time, but rather like power laws. </p>\n<p>The phenomenon of long-time tails is actually visible in the cellular automaton “approximation” to hard-sphere gases that we studied above. And its interpretation is a good example of how computational reducibility manifests itself. At a small scale, the motion of our idealized molecules shows computational irreducibility and randomness. But on a larger scale, it’s more like “collective hydrodynamics”, with fluid mechanics effects like vortices. And it’s these much-simpler-to-describe computationally reducible effects that lead to the “unexpected regularities” associated with long-time tails. </p>\n<h2 id='when-the-second-law-works,-and-when-it-doesn&rsquo;t'>When the Second Law Works, and When It Doesn&rsquo;t</h2>\n<p>At its core, the Second Law is about evolution from orderly “simple” initial conditions to apparent randomness. And, yes, this is a phenomenon we can certainly see happen in things like hard-sphere gases in which we’re in effect emulating the motion of physical gas molecules. But what about systems with other underlying rules?

And as we’ve discussed, that’s in the end what leads to the Second Law. But what about rules that don’t generate randomness, and just produce simple behavior? Well, in these cases the Second Law doesn’t apply.</p>\n<p>In standard physics, the Second Law is often applied to gases—and indeed this was its very first application area. But to a solid whose atoms have stayed in more or less fixed positions for a billion years, it really doesn’t usefully apply. And the same is true, say, for a line of masses connected by perfect springs, with perfect linear behavior.</p>\n<p>There’s been a quite pervasive assumption that the Second Law is somehow always universally valid. But it’s simply not true. The validity of the Second Law is associated with the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. And, yes, this phenomenon is quite ubiquitous. But there are definitely systems and situations in which it does not occur. And those will not show “Second Law” behavior. </p>\n<p>There are plenty of complicated “marginal” cases, however. For example, for a given rule (like the 3 shown here), some initial conditions may not lead to randomness and “Second Law behavior”, while others do: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img203_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img203.png\" alt='' title='' width='299' height='426'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>And as is so often the case in the computational universe there are phenomena one never expects, like the strange “shock-front-like” behavior of the third rule, which produces randomness, but only on a scale determined by the region it’s in:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img204_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img204.png\" alt='' title='' width='558' height='243'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that while restricting to a finite region often yields behavior that more obviously resembles a “box of gas molecules”, the general phenomenon of randomness generation also occurs in infinite regions.

And as another example, consider a hard-sphere gas in which vortex-like circulation has been set up. To get a sense of what happens we can just look at our simple discrete model.

At a small scale there’s all sorts of computational irreducibility and randomness. But on a larger scale there are features that we as observers notice that tap into pockets of reducibility, and that show the kind of order that we can describe, for example, with simple mathematical laws.</p>\n<p>There’s an extreme version of this in our Physics Project, where the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>underlying structure of space</a>—like the underlying structure of something like a gas—is full of computational irreducibility, but where there are certain overall features that observers like us notice, and that show computational reducibility. One example involves the large-scale structure of spacetime, as described by general relativity. Another involves the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>identification of particles</a> that can be considered to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>&#8220;move without change&#8221; through the system</a>.</p>\n<p>One might have thought—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#what-the-textbooks-said:-the-evolution-of-certainty'>as people often have</a>—that the Second Law would imply a degradation of every feature of a system to uniform randomness. But that’s just not how computational irreducibility works. Because whenever there’s computational irreducibility, there are also inevitably an infinite number of pockets of computational reducibility. (If there weren’t, that very fact could be used to “reduce the irreducibility”.) </p>\n<p>And what that means is that when there’s irreducibility and Second-Law-like randomization, there’ll also always be orderly laws to be found. But which of those laws will be evident—or relevant—to a particular observer depends on the nature of that observer. </p>\n<p>The Second Law is ultimately a story of the mismatch between the computational irreducibility of underlying systems, and the computational boundedness of observers like us. But the point is that if there’s a pocket of computational reducibility that happens to be “a fit” for us as observers, then despite our computational limitations, we’ll be perfectly able to recognize the orderliness that’s associated with it—and we won’t think that the system we’re looking at has just “degraded to randomness”.</p>\n<p>So what this means is that there’s ultimately no conflict between the existence of order in the universe, and the operation of the Second Law. Yes, there’s an “ocean of randomness” generated by computational irreducibility. But there’s also inevitably order that lives in pockets of reducibility. And the question is just whether a particular observer “notices” a given pocket of reducibility, or whether they only “see” the “background” of computational irreducibility. </p>\n<p>In the “hydrodynamics” example above, the “observer” picks out a “slice” of behavior by looking at aggregated local averages. But another way for an observer to pick out a “slice” of behavior is just to look only at a specific region in a system. And in that case one can observe simpler behavior because in effect “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p456--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>the complexity has radiated away</a>”.

Class 2, however, works a bit like solid matter, essentially just maintaining whatever configuration it was started in. Class 3 works more like a gas or a liquid, continually “mixing things up” in a way that looks quite random. But class 4 does something more complicated.</p>\n<p>In class 3 there aren’t significant identifiable persistent structures, and everything always seems to quickly get randomized. But the distinguishing feature of class 4 is the presence of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-8--structures-in-class-4-systems'>identifiable persistent structures</a>, whose interactions effectively define the activity of the system. </p>\n<p>So how do these types of behavior relate to the Second Law? Class 1 involves intrinsic irreversibility, and so doesn’t immediately connect to standard Second Law behavior. Class 2 is basically too static to follow the Second Law. But class 3 shows quintessential Second Law behavior, with rapid evolution to “typical random states”. And it’s class 3 that captures the kind of behavior that’s seen in typical Second Law systems, like gases.</p>\n<p>But what about class 4? Well, it’s a more complicated story. The “level of activity” in class 4—while above class 2—is in a sense below class 3. But unlike in class 3, where there is typically “too much activity” to “see what’s going on”, class 4 often gives one the idea that it’s operating in a “more potentially understandable” way. There are many different detailed kinds of behavior that appear in class 4 systems.

Class 1 and 2 systems basically behave in computationally simple ways. But as soon as we reach class 3 we’re dealing with computational irreducibility, and with a “density of computation” that lets us decode almost nothing about what comes out, with the result that what we see we can basically describe only as “apparently random”. Class 4 no doubt has the same ultimate computational irreducibility—and the same ultimate computational capabilities—as class 3. But now the computation is “less dense”, and seemingly more accessible to human interpretation. In class 3 it’s difficult to imagine making any kind of “symbolic summary” of what’s going on. But in class 4, we see <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-6--starting-from-randomness#sect-6-8--structures-in-class-4-systems'>definite structures</a> whose behavior we can imagine being able to describe in a symbolic way, building up what we can think of as a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-nature-of-explainability'>&#8220;human-accessible narrative&#8221;</a> in which we talk about “structure X collides with structure Y to produce structure Z” and so on.</p>\n<p>And indeed if we look at the picture above, it’s not too difficult to imagine that it might correspond to the execution trace of a computation we might do. And more than that, given the “identifiable components” that arise in class 4 systems, one can imagine assembling these to explicitly set up particular computations one wants to do. In a class 3 system “randomness” always just “spurts out”, and one has very little ability to “meaningfully control” what happens. But in a class 4 system, one can potentially do what amounts to traditional engineering or programming to set up an arrangement of identifiable component “primitives” that achieves some particular purpose one has chosen.</p>\n<p>And indeed in a case like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-11--the-notion-of-computation#sect-11-8--the-rule-110-cellular-automaton'>rule 110 cellular automaton</a> we know that it’s possible to perform any computation in this way, proving that the system is capable of universal computation, and providing a piece of evidence for the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. No doubt <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>rule 30 is also computation universal</a>. But the point is that with our current ways of analyzing things, class 3 systems like this don’t make this something we can readily recognize.</p>\n<p>Like so many other things we’re discussing, this is basically again a story of observers and their capabilities. If observers like us—with our computational boundedness—are going to be able to “get things into our minds” we seem to need to break them down to the point where they can be described in terms of modest numbers of types of somewhat-independent parts. And that’s what the “decomposition into identifiable structures” that we observe in class 4 systems gives us the opportunity to do.</p>\n<p>What about class 3? Notwithstanding things like our discussion of traces of initial conditions above, our current powers of perception just don’t seem to let us “understand what’s going on” to the point where we can say much more than there’s apparent randomness. And of course it’s this very point that we’re arguing is the basis for the Second Law. Could there be observers who could “decode class 3 systems”? In principle, absolutely yes. And even if the observers—like us—are computationally bounded, we can expect that there will be at least some pockets of computational reducibility that could be found that would allow progress to be made.</p>\n<p>But as of now—with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>methods of perception and analysis</a> currently at our disposal—there’s something very different for us about class 3 and class 4. Class 3 shows quintessential “apparently random” behavior, like molecules in a gas. Class 4 shows behavior that looks more like the “insides of a machine” that could have been “intentionally engineered for a purpose”. Having a system that is like this “in bulk” is not something familiar, say from physics. There are solids, and liquids, and gases, whose components have different general organizational characteristics. But what we see in class 4 is something yet different—and quite unfamiliar.</p>\n<p>Like solids, liquids and gases, it’s something that can exist “in bulk”, with any number of components. We can think of it as a “phase” of a system. But it’s a new type of phase, that we might call a “mechanoidal phase”.</p>\n<p>How do we recognize this phase? Again, it’s a question of the observer. Something like a solid phase is easy for observers like us to recognize. But even the distinction between a liquid and a gas can be more difficult to recognize. And to recognize the mechanoidal phase we basically have to be asking something like “Is this a computation we recognize?”</p>\n<p>How does all this relate to the Second Law? Class 3 systems—like gases—immediately show typical “Second Law” behavior, characterized by randomness, entropy increase, equilibrium, and so on. But class 4 systems work differently. They have new characteristics that don’t fit neatly into the rubric of the Second Law. </p>\n<p>No doubt one day we will have theories of the mechanoidal phase just like today we have theories of gases, of liquids and of solids. Likely those theories will have to get more sophisticated in characterizing the observer, and in describing what kinds of coarse graining can reasonably be done. Presumably there will be some kind of analog of the Second Law that leverages the difference between the capabilities and features of the observer and the system they’re observing. But in the mechanoidal phase there is in a sense less distance between the mechanism of the system and the mechanism of the observer, so we probably can’t expect a statement as ultimately simple and clear-cut as the usual Second Law. </p>\n<h2 id='the-mechanoidal-phase-and-bulk-molecular-biology'>The Mechanoidal Phase and Bulk Molecular Biology</h2>\n<p>The Second Law has long had an <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--defining-life/'>uneasy relationship with biology</a>. “Physical” systems like gases readily show the “decay” to randomness expected from the Second Law. But living systems instead somehow seem to maintain all sorts of elaborate organization that doesn’t immediately “decay to randomness”— and indeed actually seems able to grow just through “processes of biology”.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to point to the continual absorption of energy and material by living systems—as well as their eventual death and decay—as reasons why such systems might still at least nominally follow the Second Law. But even if at some level this works, it’s not particularly useful in letting us talk about the actual significant “bulk” features of living systems—in the kind of way that the Second Law routinely lets us make “bulk” statements about things like gases.</p>\n<p>So how might we begin to describe living systems “in bulk”? I suspect a key is to think of them as being in large part in what we’re here calling the mechanoidal phase. If one looks inside a living organism at a molecular scale, there are some parts that can reasonably be described as solid, liquid or gas. But what molecular biology has increasingly shown is that there&#8217;s often much more elaborate molecular-scale organization than exist in those phases—and moreover that at least at some level this organization seems “describable” and “machine-like”, with molecules and collections of molecules that we can say have &#8220;particular functions&#8221;, often being &#8220;carefully&#8221; and actively transported by things like the cytoskeleton.</p>\n<p>In any given organism, there are for example specific proteins defined by the genomics of the organism, that behave in specific ways. But one suspects that there&#8217;s also a higher-level or &#8220;bulk&#8221; description that allows one to make at least some kinds of general statements. There are already some known general principles in biology—like the concept of natural selection, or the self-replicating digital character of genetic information—that let one come to various conclusions independent of microscopic details.</p>\n<p>And, yes, in some situations the Second Law provides certain kinds of statements about biology. But I suspect that there are much more powerful and significant principles to be discovered, that in fact have the potential to unlock a whole new level of global understanding of biological systems and processes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s perhaps worth mentioning an analogy in technology. In a microprocessor what we can think of as the &#8220;working fluid&#8221; is essentially a gas of electrons. At some level the Second Law has things to say about this gas of electrons, for example describing scattering processes that lead to electrical resistance. But the vast majority of what matters in the behavior of this particular gas of electrons is defined not by things like this, but by the elaborate pattern of wires and switches that exist in the microprocessor, and that guide the motion of the electrons.</p>\n<p>In living systems one sometimes also cares about the transport of electrons—though more often it&#8217;s atoms and ions and molecules. And living systems often seem to provide what one can think of as a close analog of wires for transporting such things. But what is the arrangement of these “wires”? Ultimately it&#8217;ll be defined by the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-5--fundamental-issues-in-biology'>application of rules</a> derived from things like the genome of the organism. Sometimes the results will for example be analogous to crystalline or amorphous solids. But in other cases one suspects that it&#8217;ll be better described by something like the mechanoidal phase.</p>\n<p>Quite possibly this may also provide a good bulk description of technological systems like microprocessors or large software codebases. And potentially then one might be able to have high-level laws—analogous to the Second Law—that would make high-level statements about these technological systems.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that a key feature of the mechanoidal phase is that detailed dynamics—and the causal relations it defines—matter. In something like a gas it’s perfectly fine for most purposes to assume “molecular chaos”, and to say that molecules are arbitrarily mixed. But the mechanoidal phase depends on the “detailed choreography” of elements. It’s still a “bulk phase” with arbitrarily many elements. But things like the detailed history of interactions of each individual element matter. </p>\n<p>In thinking about typical chemistry—say in a liquid or gas phase—one’s usually just concerned with overall concentrations of different kinds of molecules. In effect one assumes that the “Second Law has acted”, and that everything is “mixed randomly” and the causal histories of molecules don’t matter. But it’s increasingly clear that this <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>picture isn&#8217;t correct for molecular biology</a>, with all its detailed molecular-scale structures and mechanisms. And instead it seems more promising to model what’s there as being in the mechanoidal phase. </p>\n<p>So how does this relate to the Second Law? As we’ve discussed, the Second Law is ultimately a reflection of the interplay between underlying computational irreducibility and the limited computational capabilities of observers like us. But within computational irreducibility there are inevitably always “pockets” of computational reducibility—which the observer may or may not care about, or be able to leverage.</p>\n<p>In the mechanoidal phase there is ultimately computational irreducibility. But a defining feature of this phase is the presence of “local computational reducibility” visible in the existence of identifiable localized structures. Or, in other words, even to observers like us, it’s clear that the mechanoidal phase isn’t “uniformly computationally irreducible”. But just what general statements can be made about it will depend—potentially in some detail—on the characteristics of the observer.</p>\n<p>We’ve managed to get a long way in discussing the Second Law—and even more so in doing our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>—by making only very <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>basic assumptions about observers</a>. But to be able to make general statements about the mechanoidal phase—and living systems—we’re likely to have to say more about observers. If one’s presented with a lump of biological tissue one might at first just describe it as some kind of gel. But we know there’s much more to it. And the question is what features we can perceive. Right now we can see with microscopes all kinds of elaborate spatial structures. Perhaps in the future there’ll be technology that also lets us systematically detect dynamic and causal structures. And it’ll be the interplay of what we perceive with what’s computationally going on underneath that’ll define what general laws we will be able to see emerge. </p>\n<p>We already know we won’t just get the ordinary Second Law. But just what we will get isn’t clear. But somehow—perhaps in several variants associated with different kinds of observers—what we’ll get will be something like “general laws of biology”, much like in our Physics Project we get general laws of spacetime and of quantum mechanics, and in our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>analysis of metamathematics we get &#8220;general laws of mathematics&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='the-thermodynamics-of-spacetime'>The Thermodynamics of Spacetime</h2>\n<p>Traditional twentieth-century physics treats spacetime a bit like a continuous fluid, with its characteristics being defined by the continuum equations of General Relativity. Attempts to align this with quantum field theory led to the idea of attributing an entropy to black holes, in essence to represent the number of quantum states “hidden” by the event horizon of the black hole. But in our Physics Project there is a much more direct way of thinking about spacetime in what amount to thermodynamic terms.</p>\n<p>A key idea of our Physics Project is that there’s something “below” the “fluid” representation of spacetime—and in particular that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>space is ultimately made of discrete elements</a>, whose relations (which can conveniently be represented by a hypergraph) ultimately define everything about the structure of space. This structure evolves according to rules that are somewhat analogous to those for block cellular automata, except that now one is doing replacements not for blocks of cell values, but instead for local pieces of the hypergraph. </p>\n<p>So what happens in a system like this? Sometimes the behavior is simple. But very often—much like in many cellular automata—there is great complexity in the structure that develops even from simple initial conditions:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img220_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img220.png\" alt='' title='' width='559' height='196'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>It’s again a story of computational irreducibility, and of the generation of apparent randomness. The notion of “randomness” is a bit less straightforward for hypergraphs than for arrays of cell values. But what ultimately matters is what “observers like us” perceive in the system. A typical approach is to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/the-notion-of-dimension' target=_blank rel=noopener>look at geodesic balls</a> that encompass all elements within a certain graph distance of a given element—and then to study the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/' target=_blank rel=noopener>effective geometry that emerges</a> in the large-scale limit. It’s then a bit like seeing fluid dynamics emerge from small-scale molecular dynamics, except that here (after <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Documents/some-relativistic-and-gravitational-properties-of-the-wolfram-model.pdf'>navigating many technical issues</a>) it’s the Einstein equations of General Relativity that emerge.</p>\n<p>But the fact that this can work relies on something analogous to the Second Law. It has to be the case that the evolution of the hypergraph leads at least locally to something that can be viewed as “uniformly random”, and on which statistical averages can be done. In effect, the microscopic structure of spacetime is reaching some kind of “equilibrium state”, whose detailed internal configuration “seems random”—but which has definite “bulk” properties that are perceived by observers like us, and give us the impression of continuous spacetime.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, the phenomenon of computational irreducibility means that apparent randomness can arise completely deterministically just by following simple rules from simple initial conditions. And this is presumably what basically happens in the evolution and “formation” of spacetime. (There are some additional complications associated with multicomputation that we’ll discuss at least to some extent later.)</p>\n<p>But just like for the systems like gases that we’ve discussed above, we can now start talking directly about things like entropy for spacetime. As “large-scale observers” of spacetime we’re always effectively doing coarse graining. So now we can ask how many microscopic configurations of spacetime (or space) are consistent with whatever result we get from that coarse graining.</p>\n<p>As a toy example, consider just enumerating all possible graphs (say up to a given size), then asking which of them have a certain pattern of volumes for <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/the-notion-of-dimension/' target=_blank rel=noopener>geodesic balls</a> (i.e. a certain sequence of numbers of distinct nodes within a given graph distance of a particular node). The “coarse-grained entropy” is simply determined by the number of graphs in which the geodesic ball volumes start in the same way. Here are all trivalent graphs (with up to 24 nodes) that have various such geodesic ball “signatures” (most, but not all, turn out to be vertex transitive; these graphs were found by filtering a total of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-7--trivalent-networks/'>125,816,453 possibilities</a>):</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img221_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img221.png\" alt='' title='' width='574' height='769'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>We can think of the different numbers of graphs in each case as representing different entropies for a tiny fragment of space constrained to have a given “coarse-grained” structure. At the graph sizes we’re dealing with here, we’re very far from having a good approximation to continuum space. But assume we could look at much larger graphs. Then we might ask how the entropy varies with “limiting geodesic ball signature”—which in the continuum limit is determined by dimension, curvature, etc. </p>\n<p>For a general “disembodied lump of spacetime” this is all somewhat hard to define, particularly because it depends greatly on issues of “gauge” or of how the spacetime is foliated into spacelike slices. But event horizons, being in a sense much more global, don’t have such issues, and so we can expect to have fairly invariant definitions of spacetime entropy in this case. And the expectation would then be that for example the entropy we would compute would agree with the “standard” entropy computed for example by analyzing quantum fields or strings near a black hole. But with the setup we have here we should also be able to ask more general questions about spacetime entropy—for example seeing how it varies with features of arbitrary gravitational fields.</p>\n<p>In most situations the spacetime entropy associated with any spacetime configuration that we can successfully identify at our coarse-grained level will be very large. But if we could ever find a case where it is instead small, this would be somewhere we could expect to start seeing a breakdown of the continuum “equilibrium” structure of spacetime, and where evidence of discreteness should start to show up.</p>\n<p>We’ve so far mostly been discussing hypergraphs that represent instantaneous states of space. But in talking about spacetime we really need to consider <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-graph-of-causal-relationships'>causal graphs</a> that map out the causal relationships between updating events in the hypergraph, and that represent the structure of spacetime.

And one of the results of our Physics Project is then that the flux of causal edges through the spacelike hypersurfaces our foliation defines can be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>interpreted directly as the density of physical energy</a>. (The flux through timelike hypersurfaces gives momentum.)</p>\n<p>One can make a surprisingly close analogy to causal graphs for hard-sphere gases—except that in a hard-sphere gas the causal edges correspond to actual, nonrelativistic motion of idealized molecules, while in our model of spacetime the causal edges are abstract connections that are in effect always lightlike (i.e. they correspond to motion at the speed of light). In both cases, reducing the number of events is like reducing some version of temperature—and if one approaches no-event “absolute zero” both the gas and spacetime will lose their cohesion, and no longer allow propagation of effects from one part of the system to another. </p>\n<p>If one increases density in the hard-sphere gas one will eventually <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>form something like a solid</a>, and in this case there will be a regular arrangement of both spheres and the causal edges. In spacetime something similar may happen in connection with event horizons—which may behave like an “ordered phase” with causal edges aligned.</p>\n<p>What happens if one combines thinking about spacetime and thinking about matter? A long-unresolved issue concerns systems with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1021b/'>many gravitationally attracting bodies</a>—say a &#8220;gas&#8221; of stars or galaxies. While the molecules in an ordinary gas might evolve to an apparently random configuration in a standard “Second Law way”, gravitationally attracting bodies tend to clump together to make what seem like &#8220;progressively simpler&#8221; configurations.</p>\n<p>It could be that this is a case where the standard Second Law just doesn&#8217;t apply, but there&#8217;s long been a suspicion that the Second Law can somehow be &#8220;saved&#8221; by appropriately associating an entropy with the structure of spacetime. In our Physics Project, as we&#8217;ve discussed, there&#8217;s always entropy associated with our coarse-grained perception of spacetime. And it&#8217;s conceivable that, at least in terms of overall counting of states, increased &#8220;organization&#8221; of matter could be more than balanced by enlargement in the number of available states for spacetime.</p>\n<p>We’ve discussed at length above the idea that “Second Law behavior” is the result of us as observers (and preparers of initial states) being “computationally weak” relative to the computational irreducibility of the underlying dynamics of systems. And we can expect that very much the same thing will happen for spacetime. But what if we could make a Maxwell’s demon for spacetime? What would this mean?</p>\n<p>One rather bizarre possibility is that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/'>it could allow faster-than-light &#8220;travel&#8221;</a>. Here’s a rough analogy. Gas molecules—say in air in a room—move at roughly the speed of sound. But they’re always colliding with other molecules, and getting their directions randomized. But what if we had a Maxwell’s-demon-like device that could tell us at every collision which molecule to ride on? With an appropriate choice for the sequence of molecules we could then potentially “surf” across the room at roughly the speed of sound. Of course, to have the device work it’d have to overcome the computational irreducibility of the basic dynamics of the gas.</p>\n<p>In spacetime, the causal graph gives us a map of what event can affect what other event. And insofar as we just treat spacetime as “being in uniform equilibrium” there’ll be a simple correspondence between “causal distance” and what we consider distance in physical space. But if we look down at the level of individual causal edges it’ll be more complicated. And in general we could imagine that an appropriate “demon” could predict the microscopic causal structure of spacetime, and carefully pick causal edges that could “line up” to “go further in space” than the “equilibrium expectation”.</p>\n<p>Of course, even if this worked, there’s still the question of what could be “transported” through such a “tunnel”—and for example even a particle (like an electron) presumably involves a vast number of causal edges, that one wouldn’t be able to systematically organize to fit through the tunnel. But it’s interesting to realize that in our Physics Project the idea that “nothing can go faster than light” becomes something very much analogous to the Second Law: not a fundamental statement about underlying rules, but rather a statement about our interaction with them, and our capabilities as observers.</p>\n<p>So if there’s something like the Second Law that leads to the structure of spacetime as we typically perceive it, what can be said about typical issues in thermodynamics in connection with spacetime? For example, what’s the story with perpetual motion machines in spacetime? </p>\n<p>Even before talking about the Second Law, there are already issues with the First Law of Thermodynamics—because in a cosmological setting there isn’t local conservation of energy as such, and for example the expansion of the universe can transfer energy to things. But what about the Second Law question of “getting mechanical work from heat”? Presumably the analog of “mechanical work” is a gravitational field that is “sufficiently organized” that observers like us can readily detect it, say by seeing it pull objects in definite directions. And presumably a perpetual motion machine based on violating the Second Law would then have to take the heat-like randomness in “ordinary spacetime” and somehow organize it into a systematic and measurable gravitational field. Or, in other words, “perpetual motion” would somehow have to involve a gravitational field “spontaneously being generated” from the microscopic structure of spacetime.</p>\n<p>Just like in ordinary thermodynamics, the impossibility of doing this involves an interplay between the observer and the underlying system. And conceivably it might be possible that there could be an observer who can measure specific features of spacetime that correspond to some slice of computational reducibility in the underlying dynamics—say some weird configuration of “spontaneous motion” of objects. But absent this, a “Second-Law-violating” perpetual motion machine will be impossible.</p>\n<h2 id='quantum-mechanics'>Quantum Mechanics</h2>\n<p>Like statistical mechanics (and thermodynamics), quantum mechanics is usually thought of as a statistical theory. But whereas the statistical character of statistical mechanics one imagines to come from a definite, knowable “mechanism underneath”, the statistical character of quantum mechanics has usually just been treated as a formal, underivable “fact of physics”.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, however, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>the story is different</a>, and there’s a whole lower-level structure—ultimately rooted in the ruliad—from which quantum mechanics and its statistical character appears to be derived. And, as we’ll discuss, that derivation in the end has close connections both to what we’ve said about the standard Second Law, and to what we’ve said about the thermodynamics of spacetime. </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project the starting point for quantum mechanics is the unavoidable fact that when one’s applying rules to transform hypergraphs, there’s typically more than one rewrite that can be done to any given hypergraph. And the result of this is that there are many different possible “paths of history” for the universe.</p>\n<p>As a simple analog, consider rewriting not hypergraphs but strings. And doing this, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/string-substitution-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>we get for example</a>: </p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img225_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img225.png\" alt='' title='' width='443' height='240'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>This is a deterministic representation of all possible “paths of history”, but in a sense it’s very wasteful, among other things because it includes multiple copies of identical strings (like BBBB).

So how is it that we as observers perceive definite things to happen in the world? Ultimately it’s a story of coarse graining, and of us conflating different paths in the multiway graph.</p>\n<p>But there’s a wrinkle here. In statistical mechanics we imagine that we can observe from outside the system, implementing our coarse graining by sampling particular features of the system. But in quantum mechanics we imagine that the multiway system describes the whole universe, including us. So then we have the peculiar situation that just as the universe is branching and merging, so too are our brains. And ultimately what we observe is therefore the result of a branching brain perceiving a branching universe.</p>\n<p>But given all those branches, can we just decide to conflate them into a single thread of experience? In a sense this is a typical question of coarse graining and of what we can consistently equivalence together. But there’s something a bit different here because without the “coarse graining” we can’t talk at all about “what happened”, only about what might be happening. Put another way, we’re now fundamentally dealing not with computation (like in a cellular automaton) but with multicomputation.</p>\n<p>And in multicomputation, there are always two fundamental kinds of operations: the generation of new states from old, and the equivalencing of states, effectively by the observer. In ordinary computation, there can be computational irreducibility in the process of generating a thread of successive states. In multicomputation, there can be <a href='https://www.wolframinstitute.org/bulletins/2022/06/multicomputational-irreducibility/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multicomputational irreducibility</a> in which in a sense all computations in the multiway system have to be done in order even to determine a single equivalenced result. Or, put another way, you can’t shortcut following all the paths of history. If you try to equivalence at the beginning, the equivalence class you’ve built will inevitably be “shredded” by the evolution, forcing you to follow each path separately.</p>\n<p>It’s worth commenting that just as in classical mechanics, the “underlying dynamics” in our description of quantum mechanics are reversible. In the original unmerged evolution tree above, we could just reverse each rule and from any point uniquely construct a “backwards tree”. But once we start merging and equivalencing, there isn’t the same kind of “direct reversibility”—though we can still count possible paths to determine that we preserve “total probability”.</p>\n<p>In ordinary computational systems, computational irreducibility implies that even from simple initial conditions we can get behavior that “seems random” with respect to most computationally bounded observations. And something directly analogous happens in multicomputational systems. From simple initial conditions, we generate collections of paths of history that “seem random” with respect to computationally bounded equivalencing operations, or, in other words, to observers who do computationally bounded coarse graining of different paths of history.</p>\n<p>When we look at the graphs we’ve drawn representing the evolution of a multiway system, we can think of there being a time direction that goes down the page, following the arrows that point from states to their successors. But across the page, in the transverse direction, we can think of there as being a space in which different paths of history are laid—what we call “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>”. </p>\n<p>A typical way to start constructing branchial space is to take slices across the multiway graph, then to form a branchial graph in which two states are joined if they have a common ancestor on the step before (which means we can consider them “entangled”):</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img227_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/sw020423img227.png\" alt='' title='' width='506' height='296'> </div>\n<p> <span></p>\n<p>Although the details remain to be clarified, it seems as if in the standard formalism of quantum mechanics, distance in branchial space corresponds essentially to quantum phase, so that, for example, particles whose phases would make them show destructive interference will be at “opposite ends” of branchial space. </p>\n<p>So how do observers relate to branchial space? Basically what an observer is doing is to coarse grain in branchial space, equivalencing certain paths of history. And just as we have a certain extent in physical space, which determines our coarse graining of gases, and—at a much smaller scale—of the structure of spacetime, so also we have an extent in branchial space that determines our coarse graining across branches of history.</p>\n<p>But this is where multicomputational irreducibility and the analog of the Second Law are crucial. Because just as we imagine that gases—and spacetime—achieve a certain kind of “unique random equilibrium” that leads us to be able to make consistent measurements of them, so also we can imagine that in quantum mechanics there is in effect a “branchial space equilibrium” that is achieved.</p>\n<p>Think of a box of gas in equilibrium. Put two pistons on different sides of the box. So long as they don’t perturb the gas too much, they’ll both record the same pressure. And in our Physics Project it’s the same story with observers and quantum mechanics. Most of the time there’ll be enough effective randomness generated by the multicomputationally irreducible evolution of the system (which is completely deterministic at the level of the multiway graph) that a computationally bounded observer will always see the same “equilibrium values”.</p>\n<p>A central feature of quantum mechanics is that by making sufficiently careful measurements one can see what appear to be random results. But where does that randomness come from? In the usual formalism for quantum mechanics, the idea of purely probabilistic results is just burnt into the formal structure. But in our Physics Project, the apparent randomness one sees has a definite, “mechanistic” origin. And it’s basically the same as the origin of randomness for the standard Second Law, except that now we’re dealing with multicomputational rather than pure computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>By the way, the “Bell’s inequality” statement that quantum mechanics cannot be based on “mechanistic randomness” unless it comes from a nonlocal theory remains true in our Physics Project. But in the Physics Project we have an immediate ubiquitous source of “nonlocality”: the equivalencing or coarse graining “across” branchial space done by observers.</p>\n<p>(We’re not discussing the role of physical space here. But suffice it to say that instead of having each node of the multiway graph represent a complete state of the universe, we can make an extended multiway graph in which different spatial elements—like different paths of history—are separated, with their “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-relationship-between-graphs-and-the-multiway-causal-graph/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal entanglements</a>” then defining the actual structure of space, in a spatial analog of the branchial graph.)</p>\n<p>As we’ve already noted, the complete multiway graph is entirely deterministic. And indeed if we have a complete branchial slice of the graph, this can be used to determine the whole future of the graph (the analog of “unitary evolution” in the standard formalism of quantum mechanics). But if we equivalence states—corresponding to “doing a measurement”—then we won’t have enough information to uniquely determine the future of the system, at least when it comes to what we consider to be quantum effects. </p>\n<p>At the outset, we might have thought that statistical mechanics, spacetime mechanics and quantum mechanics were all very different theories. But what our Physics Project suggests is that in fact they are all based on a common, fundamentally computational phenomenon. </p>\n<p>So what about other ideas associated with the standard Second Law? How do they work in the quantum case? </p>\n<p>Entropy, for example, now just becomes a measure of the number of possible configurations of a branchial graph consistent with a certain coarse-grained measurement. Two independent systems will have disconnected branchial graphs. But as soon as the systems interact, their branchial graphs will connect, and the number of possible graph configurations will change, leading to an “entanglement entropy”.</p>\n<p>One question about the quantum analog of the Second Law is what might correspond to “mechanical work”. There may very well be highly structured branchial graphs—conceivably associated with things like coherent states—but it isn’t yet clear how they work and whether existing kinds of measurements can readily detect them. But one can expect that multicomputational irreducibility will tend to produce branchial graphs that can’t be “decoded” by most computationally bounded measurements—so that, for example, “quantum perpetual motion”, in which “branchial organization” is spontaneously produced, can’t happen.</p>\n<p>And in the end randomness in quantum measurements is happening for essentially the same basic reason we’d see randomness if we looked at small numbers of molecules in a gas: it’s not that there’s anything fundamentally not deterministic underneath, it’s just there’s a computational process that’s making things too complicated for us to “decode”, at least as observers with bounded computational capabilities. In the case of the gas, though, we’re sampling molecules at different places in physical space. But in quantum mechanics we’re doing the slightly more abstract thing of sampling states of the system at different places in branchial space. But the same fundamental randomization is happening, though now through multicomputational irreducibility operating in branchial space.</p>\n<h2 id='the-future-of-the-second-law'>The Future of the Second Law</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>original formulation of the Second Law a century and a half ago</a>—before even the existence of molecules was established—was an impressive achievement. And one might assume that over the course of 150 years—with all the mathematics and physics that’s been done—a complete foundational understanding of the Second Law would long ago have been developed. But in fact it has not. And from what we’ve discussed here we can now see why. It’s because the Second Law is ultimately a computational phenomenon, and to understand it requires an understanding of the computational paradigm that’s only very recently emerged.</p>\n<p>Once one starts doing actual computational experiments in the computational universe (<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>as I already did in the early 1980s</a>) the core phenomenon of the Second Law is surprisingly obvious—even if it violates one’s traditional intuition about how things should work. But in the end, as we have discussed here, the Second Law is a reflection of a very general, if deeply computational, idea: an interplay between computational irreducibility and the computational limitations of observers like us. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> tells us that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> is inevitable. But the limitation of observers is something different: it’s a kind of epiprinciple of science that’s in effect a formalization of our human experience and our way of doing science.</p>\n<p>Can we tighten up the formulation of all this? Undoubtedly. We have various standard models of the computational process—like Turing machines and cellular automata. We still need to develop an “observer theory” that provides standard models for what observers like us can do. And the more we can develop such a theory, the more we can expect to make explicit proofs of specific statements about the Second Law. Ultimately these proofs will have solid foundations in the Principle of Computational Equivalence (although there remains much to formalize there too), but will rely on models for what “observers like us” can be like.</p>\n<p>So how general do we expect the Second Law to be in the end? In the past couple of sections we’ve seen that the core of the Second Law extends to spacetime and to quantum mechanics. But even when it comes to the standard subject matter of statistical mechanics, we expect limitations and exceptions to the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility and the Principle of Computational Equivalence are very general, but not very specific. They talk about the overall computational sophistication of systems and processes. But they do not say that there are no simplifying features. And indeed we expect that in any system that shows computational irreducibility, there will always be arbitrarily many “slices of computational reducibility” that can be found. </p>\n<p>The question then is whether those slices of reducibility will be what an observer can perceive, or will care about. If they are, then one won’t see Second Law behavior. If they’re not, one will just see “generic computational irreducibility” and Second Law behavior.</p>\n<p>How can one find the slices of reducibility? Well, in general that’s irreducibly hard. Every slice of reducibility is in a sense a new scientific or mathematical principle. And the computational irreducibility involved in finding such reducible slices basically speaks to the ultimately unbounded character of the scientific and mathematical enterprise. But once again, even though there might be an infinite number of slices of reducibility, we still have to ask which ones matter to us as observers.</p>\n<p>The answer could be one thing for studying gases, and another, for example, for studying molecular biology, or social dynamics. The question of whether we’ll see “Second Law behavior” then boils to whether whatever we’re studying turns out to be something that doesn’t simplify, and ends up showing computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>If we have a sufficiently small system—with few enough components—then the computational irreducibility may not be “strong enough” to stop us from “going beyond the Second Law”, and for example constructing a successful Maxwell’s demon. And indeed as computer and sensor technology improve, it’s becoming increasingly feasible to do measurement and set up control systems that effectively avoid the Second Law in particular, small systems.</p>\n<p>But in general the future of the Second Law and its applicability is really all about how the capabilities of observers develop. What will future technology, and future paradigms, do to our ability to pick away at computational irreducibility?</p>\n<p>In the context of the ruliad, we are currently localized in rulial space based on our existing capabilities. But as we develop further we are in effect <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/alien-intelligence-and-the-concept-of-technology/#the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>&#8220;colonizing&#8221; rulial space</a>. And a system that may look random—and may seem to follow the Second Law—from one place in rulial space may be “revealed as simple” from another.</p>\n<p>There is an issue, though. Because the more we as observers spread out in rulial space, the less coherent our experience will become. In effect we’ll be following a larger bundle of threads in rulial space, which makes who “we” are less definite. And in the limit we’ll presumably be able to encompass all slices of computational reducibility, but at the cost of having our experience “incoherently spread” across all of them.</p>\n<p>It’s in the end some kind of tradeoff. Either we can have a coherent thread of experience, in which case we’ll conclude that the world produces apparent randomness, as the Second Law suggests. Or we can develop to the point where we’ve “spread our experience” and no longer have coherence as observers, but can recognize enough regularities that the Second Law potentially seems irrelevant.</p>\n<p>But as of now, the Second Law is still very much with us, even if we are beginning to see some of its limitations. And with our computational paradigm we are finally in a position to see its foundations, and understand how it ultimately works.</p>\n<p id='thanks-and-notes' style=\"color:#c42c1f\"><em>Thanks &#038; Notes</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Thanks to Brad Klee, Kegan Allen, Jonathan Gorard, Matt Kafker, Ed Pegg and Michael Trott for their help—as well as to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>many people who have contributed</a> to my understanding of the Second Law over the 50+ years I’ve been interested in it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Wolfram Language to generate every image here is available by clicking the image in the online version.

Building on an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>earlier interest in space and spacecraft</a>, I’d gotten very interested in physics, and was trying to read everything I could about it. There were several shelves of physics books at the <a href='https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/about' target=_blank rel=noopener>local bookstore</a>. But what I coveted most was the largest physics book collection there: a series of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Physics_Course' target=_blank rel=noopener>five plushly illustrated college textbooks</a>. And as a kind of graduation gift when I finished <a href='https://www.dragonschool.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>(British) elementary school</a> in June 1972 I arranged to get those books. And here they are, still on my bookshelf today, just a little faded, more than half a century later:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img1.png\" width='640' height='275'></a><span id=\"more-42176\"></span></p>\n<p>For a while the first book in the series was my favorite. Then the third. The second. The fourth. <a href='https://archive.org/details/berkeleyphysicsc05kitt/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>The fifth one</a> at first seemed quite mysterious—and somehow more abstract in its goals than the others:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img2.png\" width='530' height='526'></a></p>\n<p>What story was the filmstrip on its cover telling? For a couple of months I didn’t look seriously at the book. And I spent much of the summer of 1972 writing my own (unseen by anyone else for 30+ years) <em><a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/concise-directory-physics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Concise Directory of Physics</a></em></p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img3.png\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/concise-directory-physics.pdf#page=35\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img3.png\"width='620' height='270'></a></p>\n<p>that included a rather stiff page about energy, mentioning entropy—along with the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-heat-death-of-the-universe'>heat death of the universe</a>.</p>\n<p>But one afternoon late that summer I decided I should really find out what that mysterious fifth book was all about. Memory being what it is I remember that—very unusually for me—I took the book to read sitting on the grass under some trees. And, yes, my archives almost let me check my recollection: in the distance, there’s the spot, except in 1967 the trees are significantly smaller, and in 1985 they’re bigger:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img4.png\" width='640' height='289'></a></p>\n<p>Of course, by 1972 I was a little bigger than in 1967—and here I am a little later, complete with a book called <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Planets-Life-P-H-Sneath/dp/0500100047' target=_blank rel=noopener>Planets and Life</a></em> on the ground, along with a tube of (British) Smarties, and, yes, a pocket protector (but, hey, those were actual ink pens):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img5.png\"width='316' height='440'></a></p>\n<p>But back to the mysterious green book. It wasn’t like anything I’d seen before. It was full of pictures like the one on the cover. And it seemed to be saying that—just by looking at those pictures and thinking—one could figure out fundamental things about physics. The other books I’d read had all basically said “physics works like this”. But here was a book saying “you can figure out how physics has to work”. Back then I definitely hadn’t internalized it, but I think what was so exciting that day was that I got a first taste of the idea that one didn’t have to be told how the world works; one could just figure it out:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img6.png\"width='620' height='383'></a></p>\n<p>I didn’t yet understand quite a bit of the math in the book. But it didn’t seem so relevant to the core phenomenon the book was apparently talking about: the tendency of things to become more random. I remember wondering how this related to stars being organized into galaxies. Why might that be different? The book didn’t seem to say, though I thought maybe somewhere it was buried in the math.</p>\n<p>But soon the summer was over, and I was at a <a href='https://www.etoncollege.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>new school</a>, mostly away from my books, and doing things like diligently learning more Latin and Greek. But whenever I could I was learning more about physics—and particularly about the hot area of the time: particle physics. The pions. The kaons. The lambda hyperon. They all became my personal friends. During the school vacations I would excitedly bicycle the few miles to the <a href='https://www.reading.ac.uk/library/' target=_blank rel=noopener>nearby university library</a> to check out the latest journals and the latest news about particle physics.</p>\n<p>The school I was at (<a href='https://www.etoncollege.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Eton</a>) had five centuries of history, and I think at first I assumed no particular bridge to the future. But it wasn&#8217;t long before I started hearing mentions that somewhere at the school there was a computer. I&#8217;d seen a computer in real life only once—when I was 10 years old, and from a distance. But now, tucked away at the edge of the school, above a bicycle repair shed, there was an island of modernity, a &#8220;computer room&#8221; with a glass partition separating off a loudly humming desk-sized piece of electronics that I could actually touch and use: an <a href='http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/32480/Elliott-903' target=_blank rel=noopener>Elliott 903C computer</a> with 8 kilowords of 18-bit ferrite core memory (acquired by the school in 1970 for £12,000, or about about $300k today):</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\"><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"Source: © Jim Austin Computer Collection at The Computer Sheds &#038; Neil Barrett Photography\" title=\"Source: © Jim Austin Computer Collection at The Computer Sheds &#038; Neil Barrett Photography\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney2123img7.png\"width='389' height='369'></a></p>\n<p>At first it was such an unfamiliar novelty that I was satisfied writing little programs to do things like compute primes, print curious patterns on the teleprinter, and play tunes with the built-in diagnostic tone generator. But it wasn’t long before I set my sights on the goal of using the computer to reproduce that interesting picture on the book cover.</p>\n<p>I programmed in assembler, with my programs on paper tape. The computer had <a href='http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/downloads/39396' target=_blank rel=noopener>just 16 machine instructions</a>, which included arithmetic ones, but only for integers. So how was I going to simulate colliding “molecules” with that? Somewhat sheepishly, I decided to put everything on a grid, with everything represented by discrete elements. There was a convention for people to name their programs starting with their own first initial. So I called the program SPART, for “Stephen’s Particle Program”. (Thinking about it today, maybe that name reflected some aspiration of relating this to particle physics.)</p>\n<p>It was the most complicated program I had ever written. And it was hard to test, because, after all, I didn’t really know what to expect it to do. Over the course of several months, it went through many versions. Rather often the program would just mysteriously crash before producing any output (and, yes, there weren’t real debugging tools yet). But eventually I got it to systematically produce output. But to my disappointment the output never looked much like the book cover.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know why, but I assumed it was because I was simplifying things too much, putting everything on a grid, etc. A decade later I realized that in writing my program I’d actually ended up inventing a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>form of 2D cellular automaton</a>. And I now rather suspect that this cellular automaton—like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>rule 30</a>—was actually intrinsically generating randomness, and in some sense showing what I now understand to be the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>core phenomenon of the Second Law</a>. But at the time I absolutely wasn’t ready for this, and instead I just assumed that what I was seeing was something wrong and irrelevant. (In past years, I had suspected that what went wrong had to do with <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>details of particle behavior on square</a>—as opposed to other—grids. But I now suspect it was instead that the system was in a sense generating too much randomness, making the intended “molecular dynamics” unrecognizable.)</p>\n<p>I’d love to “bring SPART back to life”, but I don’t seem to have a copy anymore, and I’m pretty sure the printouts I got as output back in 1973 seemed so “wrong” I didn’t keep them. I do still have quite a few paper tapes from around that time, but as of now I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s on them—not least because I wrote my own &#8220;advanced&#8221; paper-tape loader, which used what I later learned were error-correcting codes to try to avoid problems with pieces of “confetti” getting stuck in the holes that had been punched in the tape:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img8.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img8.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='394' height='476'></a> </p>\n<h2 id='becoming-a-physicist'>Becoming a Physicist</h2>\n<p>I don’t know what would have happened if I’d thought my program was more successful in reproducing “Second Law” behavior back in 1973 when I was 13 years old. But as it was, in the summer of 1973 I was away from “my” computer, and spending all my time on particle physics. And between that summer and early 1974 I wrote a book-length summary of what I called “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/physics-subatomic-particles.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>The Physics of Subatomic Particles</a>”:</p>\n<p>\t\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img9.png\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/physics-subatomic-particles.pdf#page=3\"> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img9.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='515' height='367'></a></p>\n<p>I don’t think I’d looked at this in any detail in 48 years. But reading it now I am a bit shocked to find history and explanations that I think are often better than I would immediately give today—even if they do bear definite signs of coming from a British early teenager writing “scientific prose”.</p>\n<p>Did I talk about statistical mechanics and the Second Law? Not directly, though there’s a curious passage where I speculate about the possibility of antimatter galaxies, and their (rather un-Second-Law-like) segregation from ordinary, matter galaxies:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/physics-subatomic-particles.pdf#page=23\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img10.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img10.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='115'></a></p>\n<p>By the next summer I was writing the 230-page, much more technical “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/introduction-weak-interaction-volume-one.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Introduction to the Weak Interaction</a>”. Lots of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. No statistical mechanics. The closest it gets is a chapter on CP violation (AKA time-reversal violation)—a longtime favorite topic of mine—but from a very particle-physics point of view. By the next year I was <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/all/'>publishing papers about particle physics</a>, with no statistical mechanics in sight—though in a picture of me (as a “lanky youth”) from that time, the <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/berkeleyphysicsc05kitt/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Statistical Physics</a></em> book is right there on my shelf, albeit surrounded by particle physics books:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img11.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img11.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='404' height='432'></a></p>\n<p>But despite my focus on particle physics, I still kept thinking about statistical mechanics and the Second Law, and particularly its implications for the large-scale structure of the universe, and things like the possibility of matter-antimatter separation. And in early 1977, now 17 years old, and (briefly) a college student in Oxford, my archives record that I gave a talk to the newly formed (and short-lived) Oxford Natural Science Club entitled “Whither Physics” in which I talked about “large, small, many” as the main frontiers of physics, and presented the visual</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img12.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img12.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='448' height='585'></a></p>\n<p>with a dash of “unsolved purple” impinging on statistical mechanics, particularly in connection with non-equilibrium situations. Meanwhile, looking at my archives today, I find some “back of the envelope” equilibrium statistical mechanics from that time (though I have no idea now what this was about):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img13.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img13.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='370' height='410'></a></p>\n<p>But then, in the fall of 1977 I ended up for the first time really needing to use statistical mechanics “in production”. I had gotten interested in what would later become a hot area: the intersection between particle physics and the early universe. One of my interests was <a href='https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/NeutrinoBackgroundRadiation.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>neutrino background radiation</a> (the neutrino analog of the cosmic microwave background); another was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/abundances-new-stable-particles-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>early-universe production of stable charged particles</a> heavier than the proton. And it turned out that to study these I needed all three of cosmology, particle physics, and statistical mechanics:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/abundances-new-stable-particles-early-universe.pdf\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img14.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='412'></a></p>\n<p>In the couple of years that followed, I worked on <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/all/'>all sorts of topics in particle physics and in cosmology</a>. Quite often ideas from statistical mechanics would show up, like when I worked on the <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/model-parton-showers-qcd.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>hadronization of quarks and gluons</a>, or when I worked on <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/expansion-rate-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>phase transitions in the early universe</a>. But it wasn’t until 1979 that the Second Law made its first explicit appearance by name in my published work.</p>\n<p>I was studying how there could be a <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/development-baryon-asymmetry-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>net excess of matter over antimatter throughout the universe</a> (yes, I’d by then given up on the idea of matter-antimatter separation). It was a subtle story of quantum field theory, time reversal violation, General Relativity—and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. And in the <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/development-baryon-asymmetry-early-universe.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>paper we wrote</a> we included a detailed appendix about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>Boltzmann&#8217;s <em>H</em> theorem</a> and the Second Law—and the generalization we needed for relativistic quantum time-reversal-violating systems in an expanding universe:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321380901674\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img15.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='658'></a></p>\n<p>All this got me thinking again about the foundations of the Second Law. The physicists I was around mostly weren’t too interested in such topics—though <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/short-talk-about-richard-feynman/'>Richard Feynman</a> was something of an exception. And indeed when I did my <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/a-precociousness-record-almost-broken/'>PhD thesis defense in November 1979</a> it ended up devolving into a spirited multi-hour debate with Feynman about the Second Law. He maintained that the Second Law must ultimately cause everything to randomize, and that the order we see in the universe today <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>must be some kind of temporary fluctuation</a>. I took the point of view that there was something else going on, perhaps related to gravity. Today I would have more strongly made the rather Feynmanesque point that if you have a theory that says everything we observe today is an exception to your theory, then the theory you have isn’t terribly useful.</p>\n<h2 id='statistical-mechanics-and-simple-programs'>Statistical Mechanics and Simple Programs</h2>\n<p>Back in 1973 I never really managed to do much science on the very first computer I used. But by 1976 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>I had access to much bigger and faster computers</a> (as well as to the ARPANET—forerunner of the internet). And soon I was routinely using computers as powerful tools for physics, and particularly for symbolic manipulation. But by late 1979 I had basically outgrown the software systems that existed, and within weeks of getting my PhD I embarked on the project of building my own computational system.</p>\n<p>It’s a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>story I&#8217;ve told elsewhere</a>, but one of the important elements for our purposes here is that in designing the system I called <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/smp-symbolic-manipulation-program/'>SMP (for &#8220;Symbolic Manipulation Program&#8221;)</a> I ended up digging deeply into the foundations of computation, and its connections to areas like mathematical logic. But even as I was developing the critical-to-<a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram-Language</a>-to-this-day paradigm of basing everything on transformations for symbolic expressions, as well as leading the software engineering to actually build SMP, I was also continuing to think about physics and its foundations.</p>\n<p>There was often something of a statistical mechanics orientation to what I did. I worked on <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cosmology-very-large-gauge-models.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>cosmology where even the collection of possible particle species had to be treated statistically</a>.

And that fall, as a way to focus my efforts, I taught a “Topics in Theoretical Physics” course at Caltech (supposedly for graduate students but actually almost as many professors came too) on what, for want of a better name, I called “non-equilibrium statistical mechanics”. My notes for the first lecture dived right in:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img17.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img17.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='530' height='733'></a></p>\n<p>Echoing what I’d seen on that book cover back in 1972 I talked about the example of the expansion of a gas, noting that even in this case “Many features [are] still far from understood”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img18.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='138'></a></p>\n<p>I talked about the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>Boltzmann transport equation</a> and its elaboration in the BBGKY hierarchy, and explored what might be needed to extend it to things like self-gravitating systems. And then—in what must have been a very overstuffed first lecture—I launched into a discussion of “Possible origins of irreversibility”. I began by talking about things like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-concept-of-ergodicity'>ergodicity</a>, but soon made it clear that this didn’t go the distance, and there was much more to understand—saying that “with a bit of luck” the material in my later lectures might help:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img19.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='115'></a></p>\n<p>I continued by noting that some systems can “develop order and considerable organization”—which non-equilibrium statistical mechanics should be able to explain:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img20.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='158'></a></p>\n<p>I then went quite “cosmological”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img21.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='112'></a></p>\n<p>The first candidate explanation I listed was the fluctuation argument Feynman had tried to use:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img22.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='148'></a></p>\n<p>I discussed the possibility of fundamental microscopic irreversibility—say associated with time-reversal violation in gravity—but largely dismissed this. I talked about the possibility that the universe could have started in a special state in which “the matter is in thermal equilibrium, but the gravitational field is not.” And finally I gave what the 22-year-old me thought at the time was the most plausible explanation:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img23.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img23.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='145'></a></p>\n<p>All of this was in a sense rooted in a traditional mathematical physics style of thinking. But the second lecture gave a hint of a quite different approach:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img24.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img24.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='107'></a></p>\n<p>In my first lecture, I had summarized my plans for subsequent lectures:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img25.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img25.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='606' height='124'></a></p>\n<p>But discovery intervened. People had discussed <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-7--reaction-diffusion-processes/'>reaction-diffusion patterns</a> as examples of structure being formed “away from equilibrium”. But I was interested in more dramatic examples, like galaxies, or snowflakes, or turbulent flow patterns, or forms of biological organisms. What kinds of models could realistically be made for these? I started from neural networks, self-gravitating gases and spin systems, and just kept on simplifying and simplifying. It was rather like language design, of the kind I’d done for SMP. What were the simplest primitives from which I could build up what I wanted?</p>\n<p>Before long I came up with what I’d soon learn <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--my-work-on-cellular-automata/'>could be called one-dimensional cellular automata</a>. And immediately I started running them on a computer to see what they did:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img26.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img26.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='473' height='512'></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, they were “organizing themselves”—even from random initial conditions—to make all sorts of structures.

And a footnote in my paper even records the fact these can generate nested patterns with a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-2--properties-of-second-order-cellular-automata-2/'>certain fractal dimension</a>—as computed in a charmingly manual way on a couple of pages I now find in my archives:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img31.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img31.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='608' height='392'></a></p>\n<p>But somehow I hadn’t quite freed myself from the assumption that microscopic irreversibility was what was “causing” structures to be formed. And this was related to another important—and ultimately incorrect—assumption: that all the structure I was seeing was somehow the result of the “filtering” random initial conditions.

And rather presciently, I made the statement that “One may speculate that [this phenomenon] is widespread in physical systems” so that “the consequences of their evolution could not be predicted, but could effectively be found only by direct simulation or observation.”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img47.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img47.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='178'></a></p>\n<p>These were the beginnings of powerful ideas, but I was still tying them to somewhat technical things like ensembles of all possible states. But in early 1984, that began to change. In January I’d been asked to write an article for the then-top popular science magazine <em><a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1984/09-01/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Scientific American</a></em> on the subject of “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computer-software-science-mathematics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Computers in Science and Mathematics</a>”. I wrote about the general idea of computer experiments and simulation. I wrote about SMP. I wrote about cellular automata. But then I wanted to bring it all together. And that was when I came up with the term “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-6--history-of-computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>”.</p>\n<p>By May 26, the concept was pretty clearly laid out in my draft text:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img48.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img48.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='804'></a></p>\n<p>But just a few days later something big happened. On June 1 I left Princeton for a trip to Europe. And in order to “have something interesting to look at on the plane” I decided to print out pictures of some cellular automata I hadn’t bothered to look at much before. The first one was rule 30:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img49.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img49.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='500' height='269'></a></p>\n<p>And it was then that it all clicked. The complexity I’d been seeing in cellular automata wasn’t the result of some kind of “self-organization” or “filtering” of random initial conditions. Instead, here was an example where it was very obviously being “generated intrinsically” just by the process of evolution of the cellular automaton. This was <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> up close. No need to think about ensembles of states or statistical mechanics. No need to think about elaborate programming of a universal computer. From just a single black cell rule 30 <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p29--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>could produce immense complexity</a>, and showed what seemed very likely to be clear computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>Why hadn’t I figured out before that something like this could happen? After all, I’d even generated a small picture of rule 30 more than two years earlier. But at the time I didn’t have a conceptual framework that made me pay attention to it. And a small picture like that just didn’t have the same in-your-face “complexity from nothing” character as my larger picture of rule 30.</p>\n<p>Of course, as is typical in the history of ideas, there’s more to the story. One of the key things that had originally let me start “scientifically investigating” cellular automata is that out of all the infinite number of possible constructible rules, I’d picked a modest number on which I could do exhaustive experiments. I’d started by considering only <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p55--more-cellular-automata/'>&#8220;elementary&#8221; cellular automata</a>, in one dimension, with <em>k</em> = 2 colors, and with rules of range <em>r</em> = 1. There are 256 such “elementary rules”. But many of them had what seemed to me “distracting” features—like backgrounds alternating between black and white on successive steps, or patterns that systematically shifted to the left or right. And to get rid of these “distractions” I decided to focus on what I (somewhat foolishly in retrospect) <a href='https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>called &#8220;legal rules&#8221;</a>: the 32 rules that leave blank states blank, and are left-right symmetric.</p>\n<p>When one uses random initial conditions, the legal rules do seem—at least in small pictures—to capture the most obvious behaviors one sees across all the elementary rules. But it turns out that’s not true when one looks at simple initial conditions. Among the “legal” rules, the most complicated behavior one sees with simple initial conditions is nesting.</p>\n<p>But even though I concentrated on “legal” rules, I still included in my <a href='https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>first major paper on cellular automata</a> pictures of a few “illegal” rules starting from simple initial conditions—including rule 30. And what’s more, in a section entitled “Extensions”, I discussed cellular automata with more than 2 colors, and showed—though without comment—the pictures:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://files.wolframcdn.com/pub/www.stephenwolfram.com/pdf/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf#page=35\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img52.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img52.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='594' height='211'></a></p>\n<p>These were low-resolution pictures, and I think I imagined that if one ran them further, the behavior would somehow resolve into something simple. But by early 1983, I had some clues that this wouldn’t happen. Because by then I was generating fairly high-resolution pictures—including ones of the <em>k</em> = 2, <em>r</em> = 2 totalistic rule with code 10 starting from a simple initial condition:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img55.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img55.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='400' height='757'></a></p>\n<p>In early drafts of my 1983 paper on “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Universality and Complexity in Cellular Automata</a>” I noted the generation of “irregularity”, and speculated that it might be associated with class 4 behavior. But later I just stated as an observation without “cause” that some rules—like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--code-10/'>code 10</a>—generate “irregular patterns”. I elaborated a little, but in a very “statistical mechanics” kind of way, not getting the main point:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img56.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img56.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='340' height='320'></a></p>\n<p>In September 1983 I did a little better:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img57.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img57.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='120'></a></p>\n<p>But in the end it wasn’t until June 1, 1984, that I really grokked what was going on. And a little over a week later I was in a scenic area of northern Sweden</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img58.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img58.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='212' height='192'></a></p>\n<p>at a posh “<a href='https://www.nobelprize.org/about/nobel-symposia/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Nobel Symposium</a>” conference on “<a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/issue/1402-4896/1985/T9' target=_blank rel=noopener>The Physics of Chaos and Related Problems</a>”—talking for the first time about the phenomenon I’d seen in rule 30 and code 10. And from June 15 there’s a <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/1985/T9/035/pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>transcript of a discussion session</a> where I bring up the never-before-mentioned-in-public concept of computational irreducibility—and, unsurprisingly, leave the other participants (who were basically all traditional mathematically oriented physicists) at best slightly bemused:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img59.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img59.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='406' height='392'></a></p>\n<p>I think I was still a bit prejudiced against rule 30 and code 10 as specific rules: I didn’t like the asymmetry of rule 30, and I didn’t like the rapid growth of code 10. (<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p59--more-cellular-automata/'>Rule 73</a>—while symmetric—I also didn’t like because of its alternating background.) But having now grokked the rule 30 phenomenon I knew it also happened in “more aesthetic” “legal” rules with more than 2 colors. And while even 3 colors led to a rather large total space of rules, it was easy to generate examples of the phenomenon there.</p>\n<p>A few days later I was back in the US, working on finishing my article for <em>Scientific American</em>. A photographer came to help get pictures from the color display I now had:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-cellular-automata-on-a-sun-2-upstairs-from-einsteins-old-office-2\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img60.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img60.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='612' height='396'></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computer-software-science-mathematics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>those pictures included</a> multicolor rules that showed the rule 30 phenomenon:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img61.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img61.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='513' height='710'></a></p>\n<p>The caption I wrote commented: “Even in this case the patterns generated can be complex, and they sometimes appear quite random.

In July I finished “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/problems-theory-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Twenty Problems in the Theory of Cellular Automata</a>” for the proceedings of the Swedish conference, including what would become a rather standard kind of picture:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img64.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img64.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='288' height='230'></a></p>\n<p>Problem 15 talks specifically about rule 30, and already asks exactly what would—35 years later—become <a href='https://rule30prize.org/'>Problem #2</a> in my <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>2019 Rule 30 Prizes</a></p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img65.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img65.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='658' height='172'></a></p>\n<p>while Problem 18 asks the (still largely unresolved) question of what the ultimate frequency of computational irreducibility is:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img66.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img66.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='658' height='172'></a></p>\n<p>Very late in putting together the <em>Scientific American</em> article I’d added to the caption of the picture showing rule-30-like behavior the statement “Complex patterns generated by cellular automata can also serve as a source of effectively random numbers, and they can be applied to encrypt messages by converting a text into an apparently random form.” I’d realized both that cellular automata could act as good random generators (we <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SeedRandom.html'>used rule 30 as the default</a> in <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RandomInteger.html'>Wolfram Language</a> for more than 25 years), and that their evolution could effectively encrypt things, much as I’d later describe the Second Law as being about “encrypting” initial conditions to produce effective irreversibility.</p>\n<p>Back in 1984 it was a surprising claim that something as simple and “science-oriented” as a cellular automaton could be useful for encryption. Because at the time <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-10--history-of-cryptography/'>practical encryption</a> was basically always done by what at least seemed like arbitrary and complicated engineering solutions, whose security relied on details or explanations that were often considered military or commercial secrets.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure when I first became aware of cryptography. But back in 1973 when I first had access to a computer there were a couple of kids (as well as a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/08/a-book-from-alan-turing-and-a-mysterious-piece-of-paper/'>teacher who&#8217;d been a friend of Alan Turing&#8217;s</a>) who were programming Enigma-like encryption systems (perhaps fueled by what were then still officially just rumors of World War II goings-on at Bletchley Park). And by 1980 I knew enough about encryption that I made a point of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>encrypting the source code of SMP</a> (using a modified version of the Unix crypt program). (As it happens, we lost the password, and it was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2016/04/smp-on-vax-emulator.png' target=_blank rel=noopener>only in 2015 that we got access</a> to the source again.)</p>\n<p>My archives record a curious interaction about encryption in May 1982—right around when I’d first run (though didn’t appreciate) rule 30. A rather colorful physicist I knew named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brosl_Hasslacher' target=_blank rel=noopener>Brosl Hasslacher</a> (who we’ll encounter again later) was trying to start a curiously modern-sounding company named Quantum Encryption Devices (or QED for short)—that was actually trying to market a quite hacky and definitively classical (multiple-shift-register-based) encryption system, ultimately to some rather shady customers (and, yes, the “expected” funding did not materialize):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img67.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img67.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='496' height='480'></a></p>\n<p>But it was 1984 before I made a connection between encryption and cellular automata. And the first thing I imagined was giving input as the initial condition of the cellular automaton, then running the cellular automaton rule to produce “encrypted output”. The most straightforward way to make encryption was then to have the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-2--the-notion-of-reversibility'>cellular automaton rule be reversible</a>, and to run the inverse rule to do the decryption. I’d already done a little bit of investigation of reversible rules, but this led to a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-2--numbers-of-reversible-cellular-automaton-rules/'>big search for reversible rules</a>—which would later come in handy for thinking about microscopically reversible processes and thermodynamics.</p>\n<p>Just down the hall from me at the Institute for Advanced Study was a distinguished mathematician named <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Milnor/' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Milnor</a>, who got very interested in what I was doing with cellular automata. My archives contain all sorts of notes from Jack, like:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img68.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img68.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='420'></a></p>\n<p>There’s even a reversible (“one-to-one”) rule, with nice, minimal BASIC code, along with lots of “real math”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img69.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img69.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='396'></a></p>\n<p>But by the spring of 1984 Jack and I were talking a lot about encryption in cellular automata—and we even began to draft a paper about it</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img70.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img70.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='494' height='411'></a></p>\n<p>complete with outlines of how encryption schemes could work:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img71.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img71.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='511' height='350'></a></p>\n<p>The core of our approach involved reversible rules, and so we did all sorts of searches to find these (and by 1984 Jack was—like me—writing C code):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img72.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img72.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='641' height='268'></a></p>\n<p>I wondered how random the output from cellular automata was, and I asked people I knew at Bell Labs about randomness testing (and, yes, email headers haven’t changed much in four decades, though then I was swolf@ias.uucp; research!ken was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ken Thompson</a> of Unix fame):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img73.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img73.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='514' height='260'></a></p>\n<p>But then came my internalization of the rule 30 phenomenon, which led to a rather different way of thinking about encryption with cellular automata. Before, we’d basically been assuming that the cellular automaton rule was the encryption key. But rule 30 suggested one could instead have a fixed rule, and have the initial condition define the key. And this is what led me to more physics-oriented thinking about cryptography—and to what I said in <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>\n<p>In July I was making “encryption-friendly” pictures of rule 30:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img74.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img74.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='508' height='428'></a></p>\n<p>But what Jack and I were most interested in was doing something more “cryptographically sophisticated”, and in particular inventing a practical public-key cryptosystem based on cellular automata. Pretty much the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-10--rsa-cryptography/'>only public-key cryptosystems known</a> then (or even now) are based on number theory. But we thought maybe one could use something like products of rules instead of products of numbers. Or maybe one didn’t need exact invertibility. Or something. But by the late summer of 1984, things weren’t looking good:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img75.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img75.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='377'></a></p>\n<p>And eventually we decided we just couldn’t figure it out. And it’s basically still not been figured out (and maybe it’s actually impossible). But even though we don’t know how to make a public-key cryptosystem with cellular automata, the whole idea of encrypting initial data and turning it into effective randomness is a crucial part of the whole story of the computational foundations of thermodynamics as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>I think I now understand them</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='where-does-randomness-come-from?'>Where Does Randomness Come From?</h2>\n<p>Right from when I first formulated it, I thought computational irreducibility was an important idea.

So, yes, in effect, I’m finally (more or less) finishing this 38 years later.</p>\n<p>But in 1984 one of the hot—if not new—ideas of the time was “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-4--history-of-chaos-theory/'>chaos theory</a>”, which talked about how &#8220;randomness&#8221; could &#8220;deterministically arise&#8221; from progressive &#8220;excavation&#8221; of higher and higher-order digits in the initial conditions for a system. But having seen rule 30 this whole phenomenon of what was often (misleadingly) called “deterministic chaos” seemed to me at best like a sideshow—and definitely not the main effect leading to most randomness seen in physical systems.</p>\n<p>I began to draft a paper about this</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img83.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img83.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='468'></a></p>\n<p>including for the first time an anchor picture of rule 30 intrinsically generating randomness—to be contrasted with pictures of randomness being generated (still in cellular automata) from sensitive dependence on random initial conditions:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img84.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img84.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='469' height='530'></a></p>\n<p>It was a bit of a challenge to find an appropriate publishing venue for what amounted to a rather “interdisciplinary” piece of physics-meets-math-meets-computation. But <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/\" target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Physical Review Letters</em></a> seemed like the best bet, so on November 19, 1984, I submitted a version of the paper there, shortened to fit in its 4-page limit.</p>\n<p>A couple of months later the journal said it was having trouble finding appropriate reviewers. I revised the paper a bit (in retrospect I think not improving it), then on February 1, 1985, sent it in again, with the new title “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/origins-randomness-physical-systems.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Origins of Randomness in Physical Systems</a>”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img85.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img85.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='450'></a></p>\n<p>On March 8 the journal responded, with two reports from reviewers. One of the reviewers completely missed the point (yes, a risk in writing shift-the-paradigm papers). The other sent a very constructive two-page report:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img86.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img86.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='640' height='666'></a></p>\n<p>I didn’t know it then, but later I found out that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraichnan' target=_blank rel=noopener>Bob Kraichnan</a> had spent much of his life working on fluid turbulence (as well as that he was a very independent and think-for-oneself physicist who’d been one of Einstein’s last assistants at the Institute for Advanced Study). Looking at his report now it’s a little charming to see his statement that “no one who has looked much at turbulent flows can easily doubt [that they intrinsically generate randomness]” (as opposed to getting randomness from noise, initial conditions, etc.). Even decades later, very few people seem to understand this.</p>\n<p>There were several exchanges with the journal, leaving it controversial whether they would publish the paper. But then in May I visited Los Alamos, and Bob Kraichnan invited me to lunch. He’d also invited a then-young physicist from Los Alamos who I’d known fairly well a few years earlier—and who’d once paid me the unintended compliment that it wasn’t fair for me to work on science because I was “too efficient”. (He told me he’d “intended to work on cellular automata”, but before he’d gotten around to it, I’d basically figured everything out.) Now he was riding the chaos theory bandwagon hard, and insofar as my paper threatened that, he wanted to do anything he could to kill the paper.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t seen this kind of “paradigm attack” before. Back when I’d been <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/particle-physics'>doing particle physics</a>, it had been a hot and cutthroat area, and I’d had papers plagiarized, sometimes even egregiously. But there wasn’t really any “paradigm divergence”. And cellular automata—being quite far from the fray—were something I could just peacefully work on, without anyone really paying much attention to whatever paradigm I might be developing.</p>\n<p>At lunch I was treated to a lecture about why what I was doing was nonsense, or even if it wasn’t, I shouldn’t talk about it, at least now. Eventually I got a chance to respond, I thought rather effectively—causing my “opponent” to leave in a huff, with the parting line “If you publish the paper, I’ll ruin your career”. It was a strange thing to say, given that in the pecking order of physics, he was quite junior to me. (A decade and half later there were nevertheless a couple of “incidents”.) Bob Kraichnan turned to me, cracked a wry smile and said “OK, I’ll go right now and tell [the journal] to <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/origins-randomness-physical-systems.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>publish your paper</a>”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img87.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img87.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='244'></a></p>\n<p>Kraichnan was quite right that the paper was much too short for what it was trying to say, and in the end it took a long book—namely <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>—to explain things more clearly. But the paper was where a high-resolution picture of rule 30 first appeared in print. And it was the place where I first tried to explain the distinction between “randomness that’s just transcribed from elsewhere” and the fundamental phenomenon one sees in rule 30 where randomness is intrinsically generated by computational processes within a system.</p>\n<p>I wanted words to describe these two different cases. And reaching back to my years of learning ancient Greek in school I invented the terms “homoplectic” and “autoplectic”, with the noun “autoplectism” to describe what rule 30 does. In retrospect, I think these terms are perhaps “too Greek” (or too “medical sounding”), and I’ve tended to just talk about “intrinsic randomness generation” instead of autoplectism. (Originally, I’d wanted to avoid the term “intrinsic” to prevent confusion with randomness that’s baked into the rules of a system.)</p>\n<p>The paper (as Bob Kraichnan pointed out) talks about many things. And at the end, having talked about fluid turbulence, there’s a final sentence—about the Second Law:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img88.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img88.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='419'></a></p>\n<p>In my archives, I find other mentions of the Second Law too.

But being quite involved in the computer industry, I couldn’t help wondering whether they might be directly useful for practical computation. And I talked about the possibility of building a “metachip” in which—instead of having predefined “meaningful” opcodes like in an ordinary microprocessor—everything would be built up “purely in software” from an underlying universal cellular automaton rule. And various people and companies started sending me <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1168506' target=_blank rel=noopener>possible designs</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1168506\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img91a.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img91a.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='481' height=''></a></p>\n<p>But in 1984 I got involved in being a consultant to an MIT-spinoff startup called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines_Corporation' target=_blank rel=noopener>Thinking Machines Corporation</a> that was trying to build a massively parallel “Connection Machine” computer with 65536 processors. The company had aspirations around AI (hence the name, which I’d actually been involved in suggesting), but their machine could also be put to work simulating cellular automata, like rule 30. In June 1985, hot off my work on the origins of randomness, I went to spend some of the summer at Thinking Machines, and decided it was time to do whatever analysis—or, as I would call it now, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>—I could on rule 30.</p>\n<p>My filesystem from 1985 records that it was fast work.

It was the same kind of underlying model as I’d tried to set up in my SPART program in 1973. But now instead of using it to study thermodynamic phenomena and the microscopic motions associated with heat, my idea was to use it to study the kind of visible motion that occurs in fluid dynamics—and in particular to see whether it could explain the apparent randomness of fluid turbulence.</p>\n<p>I knew from the beginning that I needed to rely on “Second Law behavior” in the underlying cellular automaton—because that’s what would lead to the randomness necessary to “wash out” the simple idealizations I was using in the cellular automaton, and allow standard continuum fluid behavior to emerge. And so it was that I embarked on the project of understanding not only thermodynamics, but also hydrodynamics and fluid turbulence, with cellular automata—on the Connection Machine.</p>\n<p>I’ve had the experience many times in my life of entering a field and bringing in new tools and new ideas. Back in 1985 I’d already done that several times, and it had always been a pretty much uniformly positive experience. But, sadly, with fluid turbulence, it was to be, at best, a turbulent experience.</p>\n<p>The idea that cellular automata might be useful in studying fluid turbulence definitely wasn’t obvious. The year before, for example, at the Nobel Symposium conference in Sweden, a French physicist named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel_Frisch' target=_blank rel=noopener>Uriel Frisch</a> had been summarizing the state of turbulence research. Fittingly for the topic of turbulence, he and I first met after a rather bumpy helicopter ride to a conference event—where Frisch told me in no uncertain terms that cellular automata would never be relevant to turbulence, and talked about how turbulence was better thought of as being associated (a bit like in the mathematical theory of phase transitions) with “singularities getting close to the real line”. (Strangely, I just now looked at Frisch’s paper in the <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/1985/T9/023/pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>proceedings of the conference</a>: “Ou en est la Turbulence Developpée?” [roughly: “Fully Developed Turbulence: Where Do We Stand?”], and was surprised to discover that its last paragraph actually mentions cellular automata, and its acknowledgements thank me for conversations—even though the paper says it was received June 11, 1984, a couple of days before I had met Frisch. And, yes, this is the kind of thing that makes accurately reconstructing history hard.)</p>\n<p>Los Alamos had always been a hotbed of computational fluid dynamics (not least because of its importance in simulating nuclear explosions)—and in fact of computing in general—and, starting in the late fall of 1984, on my visits there I talked to many people about using cellular automata to do fluid dynamics on the Connection Machine. Meanwhile, Brosl Hasslacher (mentioned above in connection with his 1982 encryption startup) had—after a rather itinerant career as a physicist—landed at Los Alamos. And in fact I had been asked by the Los Alamos management for a letter about him in December 1984 (yes, even though he was 18 years older than me), and ended what I wrote with: “He has considerable ability in identifying promising areas of research. I think he would be a significant addition to the staff at Los Alamos.”</p>\n<p>Well, in early 1985 Brosl identified cellular automaton fluid dynamics as a promising area, and started energetically talking to me about it. Meanwhile, the Connection Machine was just starting to work, and a young software engineer named Jim Salem was assigned to help me get cellular automaton fluid dynamics running on it. I didn’t know it at the time, but Brosl—ever the opportunist—had also made contact with Uriel Frisch, and now I find the curious document in French dated May 10, 1985, with the translated title “A New Concept for Supercomputers: Cellular Automata”, laying out a grand international multiyear plan, and referencing the (so far as I know, nonexistent) B. Hasslacher and U. Frisch (1985), “The Cellular Automaton Turbulence Machine”, Los Alamos:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img103.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img103.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='257'></a></p>\n<p>I visited Los Alamos again in May, but for much of the summer I was at Thinking Machines, and on July 18 Uriel Frisch came to visit there, along with a French physicist named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Pomeau' target=_blank rel=noopener>Yves Pomeau</a>, who had done some nice work in the 1970s on applying methods of traditional statistical mechanics to “lattice gases”.</p>\n<p>But what about realistic fluid dynamics, and turbulence? I wasn’t sure how easy it would be to “build up from the (idealized) molecules” to get to pictures of recognizable fluid flows. But we were starting to have some success in generating at least basic results. It wasn’t clear how seriously anyone else was taking this (especially given that at the time I hadn’t seen the material Frisch had already written), but insofar as anything was “going on”, it seemed to be a perfectly collegial interaction—where perhaps Los Alamos or the French government or both would buy a Connection Machine computer. But meanwhile, on the technical side, it had become clear that the most obvious square-lattice model (that Pomeau had used in the 1970s, and that was basically what my SPART program from 1973 was supposed to implement) was fine for diffusion processes, but couldn’t really represent proper fluid flow.</p>\n<p>When I first started working on cellular automata in 1981 the minimal 1D case in which I was most interested had barely been studied, but there had been quite a bit of work done in previous decades on the 2D case. By the 1980s, however, it had mostly petered out—with the exception of a group at MIT led by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fredkin' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ed Fredkin</a>, who had long had the belief that one might in effect be able to &#8220;construct all of physics&#8221; using cellular automata. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommaso_Toffoli' target=_blank rel=noopener>Tom Toffoli</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Margolus' target=_blank rel=noopener>Norm Margolus</a>, who were working with him, had built a hardware 2D cellular automaton simulator—that I happened to photograph in 1982 when visiting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_Island' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fredkin&#8217;s island in the Caribbean</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img104.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img104.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='260' height='392'></a></p>\n<p>But while “all of physics” was elusive (and our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> suggests that a cellular automaton with a rigid lattice is not the right place to start), there’d been success in making for example an idealized gas, using essentially a block cellular automaton on a square grid. But mostly the cellular automaton machine was used in a maddeningly “Look at this cool thing!” mode, often accompanied by rapid physical rewiring.</p>\n<p>In early 1984 I visited MIT to use the machine to try to do what amounted to natural science, systematically studying 2D cellular automata. The <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/two-dimensional-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>result was a paper</a> (with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Packard' target=_blank rel=noopener>Norman Packard</a>) on 2D cellular automata. We restricted ourselves to square grids, though mentioned hexagonal ones, and <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/computer-software-science-mathematics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>my article in <em>Scientific American</em> in late 1984</a> opened with a full-page hexagonal cellular automaton simulation of a snowflake made by Packard (and later in 1984 turned into one of a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/' target=_blank rel=noopener>set of cellular automaton cards</a> for sale):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img105.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img105.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='400' height='284'></a></p>\n<p>In any case, in the summer of 1985, with square lattices not doing what was needed, it was time to try hexagonal ones. I think Yves Pomeau already had a theoretical argument for this, but as far as I was concerned, it was (at least at first) just a &#8220;next thing to try”. Programming the Connection Machine was at that time a rather laborious process (which, almost unprecedentedly for me, I wasn&#8217;t doing myself), and mapping a hexagonal grid onto its basically square architecture was a little fiddly, as my notes record:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"

famous for taking down a well-known hacker) to Brosl Hasslacher, and now Tsutomu jumped into writing optimized code to implement hexagonal cellular automata on a Cray supercomputer.</p>\n<p>In my archives I now find a draft paper from September 7 that starts with a nice (if not entirely correct) discussion of what amounts to computational irreducibility, and then continues by giving theoretical symmetry-based arguments that a hexagonal cellular automaton should be able to reproduce fluid mechanics:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"

as everyone else) were starting to get results that looked at least suggestive:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"

thought, graciously) thanked Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau and Shimomura for “discussions and for sharing their unpublished results with us”, which by that point included a bunch of suggestive, if not obviously correct, pictures of fluid-flow-like behavior.</p>\n<p>To me, what was important about our paper is that, after all these years, it filled in with more detail just how computational systems like cellular automata could lead to Second-Law-style thermodynamic behavior, and it “proved” the physicality of what was going on by showing easy-to-recognize fluid-dynamics-like behavior.</p>\n<p>Just four days later, though, there was a big surprise. <em>The Washington Post</em> ran a <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/11/19/discovery-in-flow-dynamics-may-aid-car-plane-design/bdcf5b8b-dee0-4582-8180-8d792a2ab24d/' target=_blank rel=noopener>front-page story</a>—alongside the day’s characteristic-Cold-War-era geopolitical news—about the “Hasslacher–Frisch model”, and about how it might be judged so important that it “should be classified to keep it out of Soviet hands”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img113.png\"><img loading='lazy'

went crazy. There was talk of Nobel Prizes (I wasn’t buying it). There were official complaints from the French embassy about French scientists not being adequately recognized. There was upset at Thinking Machines for not even being mentioned. And, yes, as the originator of the idea, I was miffed that nobody seemed to have even suggested contacting me—even if I did view the rather breathless and “geopolitical” tenor of the article as being pretty far from immediate reality.</p>\n<p>At the time, everyone involved denied having been responsible for the appearance of the article. But years later it emerged that the source was a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gage' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Gage</a>, former political operative and longtime marketing operative at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sun Microsystems</a>, who I’d known since 1982, and had at some point introduced to Brosl Hasslacher. Apparently he’d called around various government contacts to help encourage open (international) sharing of scientific code, quoting this as a test case.</p>\n<p>But as it was, the article had pretty much exactly the opposite effect, with everyone now out for themselves. In Princeton, I’d interacted with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Orszag' target=_blank rel=noopener>Steve Orszag</a>, whose funding for his new (traditional) computational fluid dynamics company, Nektonics, now seemed at risk, and who pulled me into an emergency effort to prove that cellular automaton fluid dynamics couldn’t be competitive. (<a href='https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.1691' target=_blank rel=noopener>The paper</a> he wrote about this seemed interesting, but I demurred on being a coauthor.) Meanwhile, Thinking Machines wanted to <a href='https://patents.justia.com/patent/4691291' target=_blank rel=noopener>file a patent</a> as quickly as possible. Any possibility of the French government getting a Connection Machine evaporated and soon Brosl Hasslacher was claiming that “the French are faking their data”.</p>\n<p>And then there was the matter of the various academic papers. I had been sent the Frisch–Hasslacher–Pomeau paper to review, and checking my 1985 calendar for my whereabouts I must have received it the very day I finished my paper. I told the journal they should publish the paper, suggesting some changes to avoid naivete about computing and computer technology, but not mentioning its very thin recognition of my work.</p>\n<p>Our paper, on the other hand, triggered a rather indecorous competitive response, with two “anonymous reviewers” claiming that the paper said nothing more than its “reference 5” (the Frisch–Hasslacher–Pomeau paper). I patiently pointed out that that wasn’t the case, not least because our paper had actual simulations, but also that actually I happened to have “been there first” with the overall idea. The journal solicited other opinions, which were mostly supportive. But in the end a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kadanoff' target=_blank rel=noopener>Leo Kadanoff</a> swooped in to block it, only to publish his own a few months later.</p>\n<p>It felt corrupt, and distasteful. I was at that point a successful and increasingly established academic. And some of the people involved were even longtime friends. So was this kind of thing what I had to look forward to in a life in academia? That didn’t seem attractive, or necessary. And it was what began the process that led me, a year and a half later, to finally choose to leave academia behind, never to return.</p>\n<p>Still, despite the “turbulence”—and in the midst of other activities—I continued to work hard on cellular automaton fluids, and by January 1986 I had the first version of a long (and, I thought, rather good) <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>paper on their basic theory</a> (that was finished and published later that year):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img114.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img114.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='526' height='493'></a></p>\n<p>As it turns out, the methods I used in that paper provide some important seeds for our Physics Project, and even in recent times I’ve often found myself referring to the paper, complete with its SMP open-code appendix:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-fluids-theory.pdf#page=53\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img115.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img115.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='320'></a></p>\n<p>But in addition to developing the theory, I was also getting simulations done on the Connection Machine, and getting actual experimental data (particularly on flow past cylinders) to compare them to. By February 1986, we had quite a few results:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img116.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img116.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='670'></a></p>\n<p>But by this point there was a quite industrial effort, particularly in France, that was churning out papers on cellular automaton fluids at a high rate. I’d called my theory paper “Cellular Automaton Fluid 1: Basic Theory”. But was it really worth finishing part 2? There was a veritable army of perfectly good physicists “competing” with me. And, I thought, “I have other things to do. Just let them do this. This doesn’t need me”.</p>\n<p>And so it was that in the middle of 1986 I stopped working on cellular automaton fluids. And, yes, that freed me up to work on lots of other interesting things. But even though methods derived from cellular automaton fluids have become widely used in practical fluid dynamics computations, the key basic science that I thought could be addressed with cellular automaton fluids—about things like the origin of randomness in turbulence—has still, even to this day, not really been further explored.</p>\n<h2 id='getting-to-the-continuum'>Getting to the Continuum</h2>\n<p>In June 1986 I was about to launch both a research center (the <a href='https://www.complexityexplorer.org/explore/resources/16-center-for-complex-systems-research' target=_blank rel=noopener>Center for Complex Systems Research</a> at the University of Illinois) and a journal (<em><a href='https://www.complex-systems.com/'>Complex Systems</a></em>)—and I was also organizing a conference called <a href='http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TM-317.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>CA &#8217;86 (which was held at MIT)</a>. The core of the conference was poster presentations, and a few days before the conference was to start I decided I should find a “nice little project” that I could quickly turn into a poster.</p>\n<p>In studying cellular automaton fluids I had found that cellular automata with rules based on idealized physical molecular dynamics could on a large scale approximate the continuum behavior of fluids. But what if one just started from continuum behavior? Could one derive underlying rules that would reproduce it? Or perhaps even find the minimal such rules?</p>\n<p>By mid-1985 I felt I’d made decent progress on the science of cellular automata. But what about their engineering? What about constructing cellular automata with particular behavior? In May 1985 I had given a conference talk about “Cellular Automaton Engineering”, which turned into a paper about “<a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/approaches-complexity-engineering.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Approaches to Complexity Engineering</a>”—that in effect tried to set up “trainable cellular automata” in what might still be a powerful simple-programs-meet-machine-learning scheme that deserves to be explored:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img117.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img117.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='366'></a></p>\n<p>But so it was that a few days before the CA ’86 conference I decided to try to find a minimal “cellular automaton approximation” to a simple continuum process: diffusion in one dimension.</p>\n<p>I explained</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-continuum-systems.pdf\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img118.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img118.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='571' height='334'></a></p>\n<p>and described as my objective:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-continuum-systems.pdf#page=3\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img119.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img119.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='571' height='252'></a></p>\n<p>I used block cellular automata, and tried to find rules that were reversible and also conserved something that could serve as “microscopic density” or “particle number”.

As well as now being crucial to our whole understanding of the Second Law.</p>\n<h2 id='the-second-law-in-a-new-kind-of-science'>The Second Law in <em>A New Kind of Science</em></h2>\n<p>By the end of 1986 I had <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>begun the development of Mathematica</a>, and what would become the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/06/weve-come-a-long-way-in-30-years-but-you-havent-seen-anything-yet/'>Wolfram Language</a>, and for most of the next five years I was submerged in technology development. But in 1991 I started to use the technology I now had, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>began the project that became <em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Much of the first couple of years was spent exploring the computational universe of simple programs, and discovering that the phenomena I’d discovered in cellular automata were actually much more general. And it was seeing that generality that led me to the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. In formulating the concept of computational irreducibility I’d in effect been thinking about trying to “reduce” the behavior of systems using an external as-powerful-as-possible universal computer. But now I’d realized I should just be thinking about all systems as somehow computationally equivalent. And in doing that I was pulling the conception of the “observer” and their computational ability closer to the systems they were observing.</p>\n<p>But the further development of that idea would have to wait nearly three more decades, until the arrival of our Physics Project. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature/'>Chapter 7 on &#8220;Mechanisms in Programs and Nature&#8221;</a> describes the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p315--the-intrinsic-generation-of-randomness/'>intrinsic randomness generation</a>, and how it’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-7--mechanisms-in-programs-and-nature#sect-7-2--three-mechanisms-for-randomness'>distinguished from other sources of randomness</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>Chapter 8 on &#8220;Implications for Everyday Systems&#8221;</a> then has a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-4--fluid-flow'>section on fluid flow</a>, where I describe the idea that randomness in turbulence could be intrinsically generated, making it, for example, repeatable, rather than inevitably different every time an experiment is run.</p>\n<p>And then there’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>Chapter 9, entitled &#8220;Fundamental Physics&#8221;</a>. The majority of the chapter—and its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#maybe-it-could-apply-to-physics'>&#8220;most famous&#8221; part</a>—is the presentation of the direct precursor to our Physics Project, including the concept of graph-rewriting-based computational models for the lowest-level structure of spacetime and the universe.</p>\n<p>But there’s an <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-3--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>earlier part of Chapter 9</a> as well, and it’s about the Second Law. There’s a precursor about “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-2--the-notion-of-reversibility'>The Notion of Reversibility</a>”, and then we’re on to a section about “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-3--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>Irreversibility and the Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>”, followed by “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-4--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena'>Conserved Quantities and Continuum Phenomena</a>”, which is where the “winning rule” I discovered in 1996 <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p462--conserved-quantities-and-continuum-phenomena/'>appears again</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img131.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img131.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='560' height='332'></a></p>\n<p>My records show I wrote all of this—and generated all the pictures—between May 2 and July 11, 1995.

We did actually <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#photographs-for-the-book'>take some photographs</a> of the mechanics of real-life billiards:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img135.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img135.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='508' height='341'></a></p>\n<p>But cellular automata always seemed like a much clearer way to understand what was going on, free from issues like numerical precision, or their physical analogs. And by looking at cellular automata I felt as if I could really see down the foundations of the Second Law, and why it was true.</p>\n<p>And mostly it was a story of computational irreducibility, and intrinsic randomness generation. But then there was <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p454--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>rule 37R</a>. I’ve often said that in studying the computational universe we have to remember that the “computational animals” are at least as smart as we are—and they’re always up to tricks we don’t expect.</p>\n<p>And so it is with rule 37R. In 1986 I’d published a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>book of cellular automaton papers</a>, and as an appendix I’d included lots of <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-properties.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>tables of properties of cellular automata</a>. Almost all the tables were about the ordinary elementary cellular automata. But as a kind of “throwaway” at the very end I gave a table of the behavior of the 256 second-order reversible versions of the elementary rules, including 37R starting both from completely random initial conditions</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-properties.pdf#page=11\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img136.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img136.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='519' height='228'></a></p>\n<p>and from single black cells:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/cellular-automaton-properties.pdf#page=70\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img137.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img137.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='519' height='188'></a></p>\n<p>So far, nothing remarkable. And years go by. But then—apparently in the middle of working on the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond/'>2D systems section of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>—at 4:38am on February 21, 1994 (according to my filesystem records), I generate pictures of all the reversible elementary rules again, but now from initial conditions that are slightly more complicated than a single black cell. Opening the notebook from that time (and, yes, Wolfram Language and our notebook format have been stable enough that 28 years later that still works) it shows up tiny on a modern screen, but there it is: rule 37R doing something “interesting”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img138.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img138.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='565' height='298'></a></p>\n<p>Clearly I noticed it.

And with rule 37R I’d found it. And at the time I moved on to other things. (On March 1, 1994, I slipped on some ice and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#photographs-for-the-book'>broke my ankle</a>, and was largely out of action for several weeks.)</p>\n<p>And that takes us back to May 1995, when I was working on writing about the Second Law. My filesystem records that I did quite a few more experiments on rule 37R then, looking at different initial conditions, and running it as long as I could, to see if its strange neither-simple-nor-randomizing—and not very Second-Law-like—behavior would somehow “resolve”.</p>\n<p>Up to that moment, for nearly a quarter of a century, I had always fundamentally believed in the Second Law. Yes, I thought there might be exceptions with things like self-gravitating systems. But I’d always assumed that—perhaps with some pathological exceptions—the Second Law was something quite universal, whose origins I could even now understand through computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p>But seeing rule 37R this suddenly didn’t seem right. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I included <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p454--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>a long run of rule 37R</a> (here colorized to emphasize the structure)</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p454--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img141.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img141.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='310' height='376'></a></p>\n<p>then explained:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p453--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img142.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img142.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='542' height='259'></a></p>\n<p>How could one describe what was happening in rule 37R?

And even within Chapter 9 my discussion of the Second Law was overshadowed by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#maybe-it-could-apply-to-physics'>the outline I gave of an approach</a> to finding a truly fundamental theory of physics—and of the ideas that evolved into our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>.</p>\n<h2 id='the-physics-project&mdash;and-the-second-law-again'>The Physics Project&mdash;and the Second Law Again</h2>\n<p>After <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was finished I spent many years working mainly on technology—building <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>, launching the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> and so on. But “follow up on Chapter 9” was always on my longterm to-do list. The biggest—and most difficult—part of that had to do with fundamental physics. But I still had a great intellectual attachment to the Second Law, and I always wanted to use what I’d then understood about the computational paradigm to “tighten up” and “round out” the Second Law.</p>\n<p>I’d mention it to people from time to time. Usually the response was the same: “Wasn’t the Second Law understood a century ago? What more is there to say?” Then I’d explain, and it’d be like “Oh, yes, that is interesting”. But somehow it always seemed like people felt the Second Law was “old news”, and that whatever I might do would just be “dotting an <em>i</em> or crossing a <em>t</em>”. And in the end my Second Law project never quite made it onto my active list, despite the fact that it was something I always wanted to do.</p>\n<p>Occasionally I would write about my ideas for finding a fundamental theory of physics. And, implicitly I’d rely on the understanding I’d developed of the foundations and generalization of the Second Law. In 2015, for example, celebrating the centenary of General Relativity, I wrote about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/what-is-spacetime-really/'>what spacetime might really be like &#8220;underneath&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img144.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img144.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='324' height='328'></a></p>\n<p>and how a perceived spacetime continuum might emerge from discrete underlying structure like fluid behavior emerges from molecular dynamics—in effect through the operation of a generalized Second Law:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img145.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img145.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='324' height='241'></a></p>\n<p>It was 17 years after the publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> that (as I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>described elsewhere</a>) circumstances finally aligned to embark on what became our Physics Project. And after all those years, the idea of computational irreducibility—and its immediate implications for the Second Law—had come to seem so obvious to me (and to the young physicists with whom I worked) that they could just be taken for granted as conceptual building blocks in constructing the tower of ideas we needed.</p>\n<p>One of the surprising and dramatic implications of our Physics Project is that General Relativity and quantum mechanics are in a sense both manifestations of the same fundamental phenomenon—but played out respectively in physical space and in branchial space. But what really is this phenomenon?</p>\n<p>What became clear is that ultimately it’s all about the interplay between underlying computational irreducibility and our nature as observers. It’s a concept that had its origins in my thinking about the Second Law. Because even in 1984 I’d understood that the Second Law is about our inability to “decode” underlying computationally irreducible behavior.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d devoted <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>Chapter 10 to &#8220;Processes of Perception and Analysis&#8221;</a>, and I’d recognized that we should view such processes—like any processes in nature or elsewhere—as being fundamentally computational. But I still thought of processes of perception and analysis as being separated from—and in some sense “outside”—actual processes we might be studying. But in our Physics Project we’re studying the whole universe, so inevitably we as observers are “inside” and part of the system.</p>\n<p>And what then became clear is the emergence of things like General Relativity and quantum mechanics depends on certain characteristics of us as observers. “Alien observers” might perceive quite different laws of physics (or no systematic laws at all). But for “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers like us</a>”, who are computationally bounded and believe we are persistent in time, General Relativity and quantum mechanics are inevitable.</p>\n<p>In a sense, therefore, General Relativity and quantum mechanics become “abstractly derivable” given our nature as observers. And the remarkable thing is that at some level the story is exactly the same with the Second Law. To me it’s a surprising and deeply beautiful scientific unification: that all three of the great foundational theories of physics—General Relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics—are in effect manifestations of the same core phenomenon: an interplay between computational irreducibility and our nature as observers.</p>\n<p>Back in the 1970s I had no inkling of all this. And even when I chose to combine my discussions of the Second Law and of my approach to a fundamental theory of physics into a single chapter of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I didn’t know how deeply these would be connected. It’s been a long and winding path, that’s needed to pass through many different pieces of science and technology. But in the end the feeling I had when I first studied that book cover when I was 12 years old that “this was something fundamental” has played out on a scale almost incomprehensibly beyond what I had ever imagined.</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img146.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img146.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='550' height='360'></a></p>\n<h2 id='discovering-class-4'>Discovering Class 4</h2>\n<p>Most of my journey with the Second Law has had to do with understanding origins of randomness, and their relation to “typical Second-Law behavior”. But there’s another piece—still incompletely worked out—which has to do with surprises like rule 37R, and, more generally, with large-scale versions of class 4 behavior, or what I’ve begun to call the “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#class-4-and-the-mechanoidal-phase'>mechanoidal phase</a>”.</p>\n<p>I first identified class 4 behavior as part of my systematic exploration of 1D cellular automata at the beginning of 1983—with the “code 20” <em>k</em> = 2, <em>r</em> = 2 totalistic rule being my first clear example:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img149.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img149.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='617' height='230'></a></p>\n<p>Very soon my searches had identified a <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>whole variety of localized structures in this rule</a>:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img150.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img150.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='330' height='452'></a></p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf#page=33\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img151.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img151.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='380'></a></p>\n<p>At the time, the most significant attribute of class 4 cellular automata as far as I was concerned was that they seemed likely to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-11--the-notion-of-computation#sect-11-10--class-4-behavior-and-universality'>computation universal</a>—and potentially provably so.

But, I asked, does that infinite-size limit even “exist” for class 4 systems—or if you progressively increase the size, will the results you get keep on jumping around forever, perhaps as you succeed in sampling progressively more exotic structures?</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img152.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img152.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='394' height='387'></a></p>\n<p>A <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf#page=34' target=_blank rel=noopener>paper I wrote in September 1983</a> talks about the idea that in a sufficiently large class 4 cellular automaton one would eventually get self-reproducing structures, which would end up “taking over everything”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img153.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img153.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='279'></a></p>\n<p>The idea that one might be able to see <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--self-reproduction/'>&#8220;biology-like&#8221; self-reproduction</a> in cellular automata has a long history. Indeed, one of the multiple <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--history-of-cellular-automata/'>ways that cellular automata were invented</a> (and the one that led to their name) was through <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/john-von-neumanns-100th-birthday/'>John von Neumann</a>’s 1952 effort to construct a complicated cellular automaton in which there could be a complicated configuration capable of self-reproduction.</p>\n<p>But could self-reproducing structures ever “occur naturally” in cellular automata? Without the benefit of intuition from things like rule 30, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/john-von-neumanns-100th-birthday/'>von Neumann assumed</a> that something like self-reproduction would need an incredibly complicated setup, as it seems to have, for example, in biology. But having seen rule 30—and more so class 4 cellular automata—it didn’t seem so implausible to me that even with very simple underlying rules, there could be fairly simple configurations that would show phenomena like self-reproduction.</p>\n<p>But for such a configuration to “occur naturally” in a random initial condition might require a system with exponentially many cells. And I wondered if in the oceans of the early Earth there might have been only “just enough” molecules for something like a self-reproducing lifeform to occur.</p>\n<p>Back in 1983 I already had pretty efficient code for searching for structures in class 4 cellular automata. But even running for days at a time, I never found anything more complicated than purely periodic (if sometimes moving) structures. And in March 1985, following an <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/media/computer-recreations/'>article about my work in <em>Scientific American</a></em>, I <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2023/02/glider-gun-guidelines.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>appealed to the public to find &#8220;interesting structures&#8221;</a>—like “glider guns” that would “shoot out” moving structures:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img154.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img154.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='600' height='614'></a></p>\n<p>As it happened, right before I made my “public appeal”, a student at Princeton working with a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Steiglitz' target=_blank rel=noopener>professor I knew</a> had sent me a glider gun he’d found the <em>k</em> = 2, <em>r</em> = 3 totalistic code 88 rule:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img157.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img157.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='178'></a></p>\n<p>At the time, though, with computer displays only large enough to see behavior like</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img158a_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img158.png\" alt='' title='' width='281' height='166'> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>I wasn’t convinced this was an “ordinary class 4 rule”—even though now, with the benefit of higher display resolution, it seems more convincing:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img159a_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img159.png\" alt='' title='' width='333' height='227'> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>The “public appeal” generated a lot of interesting feedback—but no glider guns or other exotic structures in the rules I considered “obviously class 4”. And it wasn’t until after I started working on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> that I got back to the question. But then, on the evening of December 31, 1991, using exactly the same code as in 1983, but now with faster computers, there it was: in an ordinary <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p282--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>class 4 rule (<em>k</em> = 3, <em>r</em> = 1 code 1329)</a>, after finding several localized structures, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p288--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>there was one that grew without bound</a> (albeit not in the most obvious “glider gun” way):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p287--structures-in-class-4-systems\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img162.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img162.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='611' height='365'></a></p>\n<p>But that wasn’t all.

In 1994, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-11--the-notion-of-computation#sect-11-8--the-rule-110-cellular-automaton'>lots of work on rule 110</a>. In 1995, the surprise of rule 37R.

Some years we asked students to pick their “favorite cellular automaton”. Often they were class 4:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img164.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img164.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='587' height='330'></a></p>\n<p>And occasionally someone would do a project to explore the world of some particular class 4 rule. But beyond those specifics—and statements about computation universality—it’s never been clear quite what one could say about class 4.</p>\n<p>Back in 1984 in the <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/' target=_blank rel=noopener>series of cellular automaton postcards</a> I’d produced, there were a couple of class 4 examples:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img165.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img165.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='218'></a></p>\n<p>And even then the typical response to these images was that they looked “organic”—like the kind of thing living organisms might produce. A decade later—for <em>A New Kind of Science</em>—I studied “organic forms” quite a bit, trying to understand how organisms <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-6--growth-of-plants-and-animals'>get their overall shapes</a>, and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-7--biological-pigmentation-patterns'>surface patterns</a>. Mostly that didn’t end up being a story of class 4 behavior, though.</p>\n<p>Since the early 1980s I’ve been interested in molecular computing, and in how computation might be done at the level of molecules. My discoveries in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> (and specifically the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>) convinced me that it should be possible to get even fairly simple collections of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-11--implications-for-technology'>molecules to &#8220;do arbitrary computations&#8221;</a> or even build more or less arbitrary structures (in a more general and streamlined way than happens with the whole protein synthesis structure in biology). And over the years, I sometimes thought about trying to do practical work in this area. But it didn’t feel as if the ambient technology was quite ready. So I never jumped in.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I’d long understood the basic correspondence between <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a> and patterns of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-11--implications-for-chemistry/'>possible pathways for chemical reactions</a>. And after our Physics Project was announced in 2020 and we began to develop the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>general multicomputational paradigm</a>, I immediately considered <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular computing</a> a potential application. But just what might the “choreography” of molecules be like? What causal relationships might there be, for example, between different interactions of the same molecule? That’s not something ordinary chemistry—dealing for example with liquid-phase reactions—tends to consider important.</p>\n<p>But what I increasingly started to wonder is whether in molecular biology it might actually be crucial. And even in the 20 years since <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was published, it’s become increasingly clear that in molecular biology things are extremely “orchestrated”. It’s not about molecules randomly moving around, like in a liquid. It’s about molecules being carefully channeled and actively transported from one “event” to another.</p>\n<p>Class 3 cellular automata seem to be good “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#metamodeling-and-the-metatheory-of-models'>metamodels</a>” for things like liquids, and readily give Second-Law-like behavior. But what about the kind of situation that seems to exist in molecular biology? It’s something I’ve been thinking about only recently, but I think this is a place where class 4 cellular automata can contribute. I’ve started calling the “bulk limit” of class 4 systems the “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#class-4-and-the-mechanoidal-phase'>mechanoidal phase</a>”. It’s a place where the ordinary Second Law doesn’t seem to apply.</p>\n<p>Four decades ago when I was trying to understand how structure could arise “in violation of the Second Law” I didn’t yet even know about computational irreducibility. But now we’ve come a lot further, in particular with the development of the multicomputational paradigm, and the recognition of the importance of the characteristics of the observer in defining what perceived overall laws there will be. It’s an inevitable feature of computational irreducibility that there will always be an infinite sequence of new challenges for science, and new pieces of computational reducibility to be found. So, now, yes, a challenge is to understand the mechanoidal phase. And with all the tools and ideas we’ve developed, I’m hoping the process will happen more than it has for the ordinary Second Law.</p>\n<h2 id='the-end-of-a-50-year-journey'>The End of a 50-Year Journey</h2>\n<p>I began my quest to understand the Second Law a bit more than 50 years ago. And—even though there’s certainly more to say and figure out—it’s very satisfying now to be able to bring a certain amount of closure to what has been the single longest-running piece of intellectual “unfinished business” in my life. It’s been an interesting journey—that’s very much relied on, and at times helped drive, the tower of science and technology that I’ve spent my life building. There are many things that might not have happened as they did. And in the end it’s been a story of longterm intellectual tenacity—stretching across much of my life so far.</p>\n<p>For a long time I’ve kept (automatically when possible) quite <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/'>extensive archives</a>. And now these archives allow one to reconstruct in almost unprecedented detail my journey with the Second Law. One sees the gradual formation of intellectual frameworks over the course of years, then the occasional discovery or realization that allows one to take the next step in what is sometimes mere days. There’s a curious interweaving of computational and essentially philosophical methodologies—with an occasional dash of mathematics.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there’s general intuition that’s significantly ahead of specific results. But more often there’s a surprise computational discovery that seeds the development of new intuition. And, yes, it’s a little embarrassing how often I managed to generate in a computer experiment something that I completely failed to interpret or even notice at first because I didn’t have the right intellectual framework or intuition.</p>\n<p>And in the end, there’s an air of computational irreducibility to the whole process: there really wasn’t a way to shortcut the intellectual development; one just had to live it. Already in the 1990s I had taken things a fair distance, and I had even written a little about what I had figured out. But for years it hung out there as one of a small collection of unfinished projects: to finally round out the intellectual story of the Second Law, and to write down an exposition of it. But the arrival of our Physics Project just over two years ago brought both a cascade of new ideas, and for me personally a sense that even things that had been out there for a long time could in fact be brought to closure.</p>\n<p>And so it is that I’ve returned to the quest I began when I was 12 years old—but now with five decades of new tools and new ideas. The wonder and magic of the Second Law is still there. But now I’m able to see it in a much broader context, and to realize that it’s not just a law about thermodynamics and heat, but instead a window into a very general computational phenomenon. None of this I could know when I was 12 years old. But somehow the quest I was drawn to all those years ago has turned out to be deeply aligned with the whole arc of intellectual development that I have followed in my life. And no doubt it’s no coincidence.</p>\n<p>But for now I’m just grateful to have had the quest to understand Second Law as one of my guiding forces through so much of my life, and now to realize that my quest was part of something so broad and so deep.</p>\n<h2 id='appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>Appendix: The Backstory of the Book Cover That Started It All</h2>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img166.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img166.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='530' height='297'></a></p>\n<p>What is the backstory of the book cover that launched my long journey with the Second Law?

It turned out to be a complex story, reaching back to the earliest serious uses of computers for basic science, and even beyond.</p>\n<p>The book had been born out the sense of urgency around science education in the US that followed the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union—with a group of professors from Berkeley and Harvard believing that the teaching of freshman college physics was in need of modernization, and that they should write a series of textbooks to enable this. (It was also the time of the “new math”, and a host of other STEM-related educational initiatives.) <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Reif' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fred Reif</a> (who died at the age of 92 in 2019) was asked to write the statistical physics volume.

And in 2001 I was able to tell Fred Reif that, yes, his book had indeed been useful. He said he was pleased to learn that, adding “It is all too rare that one’s educational efforts seem to bear some fruit.”</p>\n<p>He explained to me that when he was writing the book he thought that “the basic ideas of irreversibility and fluctuations might be very vividly illustrated by the behavior of a gas of particles spreading through a box”. He added: “It then occurred to me that Berni Alder might actually show this by a computer generated film since he had worked on molecular dynamics simulations and had also good computer facilities available to him. I was able to enlist Berni’s interest in this project, with the results shown in my book.”</p>\n<p>The acknowledgements in the book report:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img171.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img171.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='556' height='185'></a></p>\n<p>Berni Alder and and Fred Reif did indeed create a “film loop”, which “could be bought separately from the book and viewed in the physics lab”, as Alder told me, adding that “I understand the students liked it very much, but the venture was not a commercial success.” Still, he sent me a copy of a videotape version:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img172.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img172.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='440' height='259'></a></p>\n<p>The film (which has no sound) begins:</p>\n<p>\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img173.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img173.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='170'></a></p>\n<p>Soon it’s showing an actual process of “coming to equilibrium”:</p>\n<p><video width=\"614\" height=\"264\" controls><source src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw12journey122822-video.mp4\"></video></p>\n<p>“However”, as Alder explained it to me, “if a large number of particles are put in the corner and the velocities of all the particles are reversed after a certain time, the audience laughs or is supposed to after all the particles return to their original positions.” (One suspects that particularly in the 1960s this might have been reminiscent of various cartoon-film gags.)</p>\n<p>OK, so how were the pictures (and the film) made? It was done in 1964 at what’s now <a href='https://www.llnl.gov/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lawrence Livermore Lab</a> (that had been created in 1952 as a spinoff of the <a href='https://history.aip.org/exhibits/lawrence/radlab.htm' target=_blank rel=noopener>Berkeley Radiation Lab</a>, which had initiated some key pieces for the Manhattan Project) on a computer called the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_LARC' target=_blank rel=noopener>LARC (&#8220;Livermore Advanced Research Computer&#8221;)</a>, first made in 1960, that was probably the most advanced scientific computer of the time. Alder explained to me, however: “We could not run the problem much longer than about 10 collision times with 64 bits [<em>sic</em>] arithmetic before the round-off error prevented the particles from returning.”</p>\n<p>Why did they start the particles off in a somewhat random configuration? (The randomness, Alder told me, had been created by a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-5--random-number-generators/'>middle-square random number generator</a>.) Apparently if they’d been in a regular array—which would have made the whole process of randomization much easier to see—the roundoff errors would have been too obvious. (And it’s issues like this that made it so hard to recognize the rule 30 phenomenon in systems based on real numbers—and without the idea of just studying simple programs not tied to traditional equation-based formulations of physics.)</p>\n<p>The actual code for the molecular dynamics simulation was written in assembler and run by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ann_Mansigh' target=_blank rel=noopener>Mary Ann Mansigh (Karlsen)</a>, who had a degree in math and chemistry and worked as a programmer at Livermore from 1955 until the 1980s, much of the time specifically with Alder. Here she is at the console of the LARC (yes, computers had built-in desks in those days):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img174.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img174.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='334' height='253'></a></p>\n<p>The program that was used was called STEP, and the original version of it had actually been written (by a certain <a href='http://www.cap-lore.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Norm Hardy</a>, who ended up having a long Silicon Valley career) to run on a previous generation of computer. (A still-earlier program was called APE, for “Approach to Equilibrium”.) But it was only with the LARC—and STEP—that things were fast enough to run substantial simulations, at the rate of about 200,000 collisions per hour (the simulation for the book cover involved 40 particles and about 500 collisions). At the time of the book STEP used an <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> algorithm where all pairs of particles were tested for collisions; later a neighborhood-based linked list method was used.</p>\n<p>The standard method of getting output from a computer back in 1964—and basically until the 1980s—was to print characters on paper. But the LARC could also drive an oscilloscope, and it was with this that the graphics for the book were created (capturing them from the oscilloscope screen with a Polaroid instant camera).</p>\n<p>But why was Berni Alder studying molecular dynamics and “hard sphere gases” in the first place? Well, that’s another long story. But ultimately it was driven by the effort to develop a microscopic theory of liquids.</p>\n<p>The notion that gases might consist of discrete molecules in motion <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#what-is-heat?'>had arisen in the 1700s</a> (and even to some extent in antiquity), but it was only in the mid-1800s that serious <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>development of the &#8220;kinetic theory&#8221; idea</a> began. Pretty immediately it was clear how to derive the ideal gas law <em>P V</em> = <em>R T</em> for essentially non-interacting molecules. But what analog of this “equation of state” might apply to gases with significant interactions between molecules, or, for that matter, liquids? In 1873 <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals' target=_blank rel=noopener>Johannes Diderik van der Waals</a> proposed, on essentially empirical grounds, the formula (<em>P</em> + <em>a</em>/<em>V</em><sup>2</sup>)(<em>V</em>&#8211;<em>b</em>) = <em>RT</em>—where the parameter <em>b</em> represented “excluded volume” taken up by molecules, that were implicitly being viewed as hard spheres. But could such a formula be derived—like the ideal gas law—from a microscopic kinetic theory of molecules? At the time, nobody really knew how to start, and the problem languished for more than half a century.</p>\n<p>(It’s worth pointing out, by the way, that the idea of modeling gases, as opposed to liquids, as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>collections of hard spheres was extensively pursued</a> in the mid-1800s, notably by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Maxwell/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Maxwell</a> and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boltzmann/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Boltzmann</a>—though with their traditional mathematical analysis methods, they were limited to studying average properties of what amount to dilute gases.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there was increasing interest in the microscopic structure of liquids, particularly among chemists concerned for example with how chemical solutions might work. And at the end of the 1920s the technique of x-ray diffraction, which had originally been used to study the microscopic structure of crystals, was applied to liquids—allowing in particular the experimental determination of the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PairCorrelationG.html'>radial distribution function</a> (or pair correlation function) <em>g</em>(<em>r</em>), which gives the probability to find another molecule a distance <em>r</em> from a given one.</p>\n<p>But how might this radial distribution function be computed? By the mid-1930s there were several proposals based on <a href='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.80.2067.125' target=_blank rel=noopener>looking at the statistics of random assemblies</a> of hard spheres:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img178.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img178.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='185' height='188'></a></p>\n<p>Some tried to get results by mathematical methods; others did physical experiments with ball bearings and gelatin balls, <a href='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.80.2067.125' target=_blank rel=noopener>getting at least rough agreement</a> with actual experiments on liquids:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img179.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img179.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='355' height='306'></a></p>\n<p>But then in 1939 a physical chemist named <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gamble_Kirkwood' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Kirkwood</a> gave an <a href='https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1750344' target=_blank rel=noopener>actual probabilistic derivation</a> (using a variety of simplifying assumptions) that fairly closely reproduced the radial distribution function:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img180.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img180.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='168'></a></p>\n<p>But what about just computing from first principles, on the basis of the mechanics of colliding molecules? Back in 1872 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>Ludwig Boltzmann had proposed a statistical equation</a> (the “Boltzmann transport equation”) for the behavior of collections of molecules, that was based on the approximation of independent probabilities for individual molecules. By the 1940s the independence assumption had been overcome, but at the cost of introducing an infinite hierarchy of equations (the “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBGKY_hierarchy' target=_blank rel=noopener>BBGKY hierarchy</a>”, where the “K” stood for Kirkwood). And although the full equations were intractable, approximations were suggested that—while themselves mathematically sophisticated—seemed as if they should, at least in principle, be applicable to liquids.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in 1948, Berni Alder, fresh from a master&#8217;s degree in chemical engineering, and already interested in liquids, went to Caltech to work on a PhD with John Kirkwood—who suggested that he look at a couple of approximations to the BBGKY hierarchy for the case of hard spheres. This led to some nasty integro-differential equations which couldn&#8217;t be solved by analytical techniques. Caltech didn&#8217;t yet have a computer in the modern sense, but in 1949 they acquired an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_604' target=_blank rel=noopener>IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch</a>, which could be wired to do calculations with input and output specified on punched cards—and it was on this machine that Alder got the calculations he needed done (the paper records that “[this] &#8230; was calculated &#8230; with the use of IBM equipment and the file of punched cards of <em>sin</em>(<em>ut</em>) employed in these laboratories for electron diffraction calculation”):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img181.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img181.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='212'></a></p>\n<p>Our story now moves to Los Alamos, where in 1947 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ulam/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Stan Ulam</a> had suggested the Monte Carlo method as a way to study neutron diffusion. In 1949 the method was implemented on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC' target=_blank rel=noopener>ENIAC computer</a>. And in 1952 Los Alamos got its own <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I' target=_blank rel=noopener>MANIAC computer</a>. Meanwhile, there was significant interest at Los Alamos in computing equations of state for matter, especially in extreme conditions such as those in a nuclear explosion. And by 1953 the idea had arisen of using the Monte Carlo method to do this.</p>\n<p>The concept was to take a collection of hard spheres (or actually 2D disks), and move them randomly in a series of steps with the constraint that they could not overlap—then look at the statistics of the resulting “equilibrium” configurations. This was done on the MANIAC, with the resulting paper now giving “Monte Carlo results” for things like the radial distribution function:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img182.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img182.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='590' height='494'></a></p>\n<p>Kirkwood and Alder had been continuing their BBGKY hierarchy work, now using more realistic Lennard-Jones forces between molecules. But by 1954 Alder was also using the Monte Carlo method, implementing it partly (rather painfully) on the IBM Electronic Calculating Punch, and partly on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_computers' target=_blank rel=noopener>Manchester Mark II</a> computer in the UK (whose documentation had been written by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/06/happy-100th-birthday-alan-turing/'>Alan Turing</a>):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img183.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img183.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='614' height='142'></a></p>\n<p>In 1955 Alder started working full-time at Livermore, recruited by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller' target=_blank rel=noopener>Edward Teller</a>. Another Livermore recruit—fresh from a physics PhD—was <a href='https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/eastbaytimes/name/thomas-wainwright-obituary?id=32749324' target=_blank rel=noopener>Thomas Wainwright</a>. And soon Alder and Wainwright came up with an alternative to the Monte Carlo method—that would eventually give the book cover pictures: just explicitly compute the dynamics of colliding hard spheres, with the expectation that after enough collisions the system would come to equilibrium and allow things like equations of state to be obtained.</p>\n<p>In 1953 Livermore had obtained its first computer: a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I' target=_blank rel=noopener>Remington Rand Univac I</a>. And it was on this computer that Alder and Wainwright did a first proof of concept of their method, tracing 100 hard spheres with collisions computed at the rate of about 100 per hour. Then in 1955 Livermore got <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704' target=_blank rel=noopener>IBM 704</a> computers, which, with their hardware floating-point capabilities, were able to compute about 2000 collisions per hour.</p>\n<p>Alder and Wainwright reported their first results at a statistical mechanics conference in Brussels in August 1956 (organized by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ilya Prigogine</a>). The published version appeared in 1958:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img184.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img184.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='392' height='195'></a></p>\n<p>It gives evidence—that they tagged as “provisional”—for the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases'>emergence of a Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution</a> “after the system reached equilibrium”</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img185.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img185.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='256' height='210'></a></p>\n<p>as well as things like the radial distribution function—and the equation of state:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img186.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img186.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='585' height='209'></a></p>\n<p>It was notable that there seemed to be a discrepancy between the results for the equation of state computed by explicit molecular dynamics and by the Monte Carlo method. And what is more, there seemed to be evidence of some kind of discontinuous phase-transition-like behavior as the density of spheres changed (an effect which Kirkwood had predicted in 1949).</p>\n<p>Given the small system sizes and short runtimes it was all a bit muddy. But by August 1957 Alder and Wainwright announced that they’d found a phase transition, presumably between a high-density phase where the spheres were packed together like in a crystalline solid, and a low-density phase, where they were able to more freely “wander around” like in a liquid or gas. Meanwhile, the group at Los Alamos had redone their Monte Carlo calculations, and they too now claimed a phase transition. Their papers were published back to back:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img187.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img187.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='620' height='369'></a></p>\n<p>But at this point no actual pictures of molecular trajectories had yet been published, or, I believe, made. All there was were traditional plots of aggregated quantities. And in 1958, these plots made their first appearance in a textbook.

And in that article—entitled “<a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/molecular-motions/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Molecular Motions</a>”, from October 1959—there were finally pictures of actual trajectories, with their caption explaining that the “paths of particles &#8230; appear as bright lines on the face of a cathode-ray tube hooked to a computer” (the paths are of the centers of the colliding disks):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img189.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img189.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='507' height='519'></a></p>\n<p>A <a href='https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1730376' target=_blank rel=noopener>technical article</a> published at the same time gave a diagram of the logic for the dynamical computation:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img190.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img190.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='420' height='515'></a></p>\n<p>Then in 1960 Livermore (after various delays) took delivery of the LARC computer—arguably the first scientific supercomputer—which allowed molecular dynamics computations to be done perhaps 20 times times faster.

And in 1967, Alder and Wainwright made another discovery about hard spheres. Even in their first paper about molecular dynamics they’d plotted the velocity autocorrelation function, and noted that it decayed roughly exponentially with time. But by 1967 they had much more precise data, and realized that there was a deviation from exponential decay: a definite “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-999d/'>long-time tail</a>”. And soon they had figured out that this power-law tail was basically the result of a continuum hydrodynamic effect (essentially a vortex) operating even on the scale of a few molecules. (And—though it didn’t occur to me at the time—this should have suggested that even with fairly small numbers of cells cellular automaton fluid simulations had a good chance of giving recognizable hydrodynamic results.)</p>\n<p>It’s never been entirely easy to do molecular dynamics, even with hard spheres, not least because in standard computations one’s inevitably confronted with things like numerical roundoff errors. And no doubt this is why some of the obvious foundational questions about the Second Law weren’t really explored there, and why intrinsic randomness generation and the rule 30 phenomenon weren’t identified.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, even before molecular dynamics emerged, there was already one computer study of what could potentially have been Second Law behavior. Visiting Los Alamos in the early 1950s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi' target=_blank rel=noopener>Enrico Fermi</a> had gotten interested in using computers for physics, and wondered what would happen if one simulated the motion of an array of masses with nonlinear springs between them. The results of running this on the MANIAC computer were <a href='https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4376203' target=_blank rel=noopener>reported in 1955</a> (after Fermi had died)</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4376203\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img192.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img192.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='392' height='656'></a></p>\n<p>and it was noted that there wasn’t just exponential approach to equilibrium, but instead something more complicated (later connected to solitons). Strangely, though, instead of plotting actual particle trajectories, what were given were mode energies—but these still exhibited what, if it hadn’t been obscured by continuum issues, might have been recognized as something like the rule 30 phenomenon:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img193.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img193.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='474' height='294'></a></p>\n<p>But I knew none of this history when I saw the <em>Statistical Physics</em> book cover in 1972. And indeed, for all I knew, it could have been a “standard statistical physics cover picture”. I didn’t know it was the first of its kind—and a leading-edge example of the use of computers for basic science, accessible only with the most powerful computers of the time. Of course, had I known those things, I probably wouldn’t have tried to reproduce the picture myself and I wouldn’t have had that early experience in trying to use a computer to do science. (Curiously enough, looking at the numbers now, I realize that the base speed of the LARC was only 20x the Elliott 903C, though with floating point, etc.—a factor that pales in comparison with the 500x speedup in computers in the 40 years since I started working on cellular automata.)</p>\n<p>But now I know the history of that book cover, and where it came from. And what I only just discovered now is that actually there’s a bigger circle than I knew. Because the path from Berni Alder to that book cover to my work on cellular automaton fluids came full circle—when in 1988 Alder <a href='https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.381' target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote a paper based on cellular automaton fluids</a> (though through the vicissitudes of academic behavior I don’t think he knew these had been my idea—and now it’s too late to tell him his role in seeding them):</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img194.png\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/02/swjourney020123img194.png\" alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" width='590' height='285'></a></p>\n<p id='notes-and-thanks' style=\"color:#c42c1f\"><em>Notes &#038; Thanks</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">There are many people who’ve contributed to the 50-year journey I’ve described here. Some I’ve already mentioned by name, but others not—including many who doubtless wouldn’t even be aware that they contributed. The longtime store clerk at Blackwell’s bookstore who in 1972 sold college physics books to a 12-year old without batting an eye. (I learned his name—Keith Clack—30 years later when he organized a book signing for <em>A New Kind of Science</em> at Blackwell’s.) John Helliwell and Lawrence Wickens who in 1977 invited me to give the first talk where I explicitly discussed the foundations of the Second Law. Douglas Abraham who in 1977 taught a course on mathematical statistical mechanics that I attended. Paul Davies who wrote a book on <em>The Physics of Time Asymmetry</em> that I read around that time. Rocky Kolb who in 1979 and 1980 worked with me on cosmology that used statistical mechanics. The students (including professors like Steve Frautschi and David Politzer) who attended my 1981 class at Caltech about “nonequilibrium statistical mechanics”. David Pines and Elliott Lieb who in 1983 were responsible for publishing my breakout paper on “Statistical Mechanics of Cellular Automata”. Charles Bennett (curiously, a student of Berni Alder’s) with whom in the early 1980s I discussed applying computation theory (notably the ideas of Greg Chaitin) to physics. Brian Hayes who commissioned my 1984 <em>Scientific American</em> article, and Peter Brown who edited it. Danny Hillis and Sheryl Handler who in 1984 got me involved with Thinking Machines. Jim Salem and Bruce Nemnich (Walker) who worked on fluid dynamics on the Connection Machine with me. Then—36 years later—Jonathan Gorard and Max Piskunov, who catalyzed the doing of our Physics Project.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In the last 50 years, there’ve been surprisingly few people with whom I’ve directly discussed the foundations of the Second Law. Perhaps one reason is that back when I was a “professional physicist” statistical mechanics as a whole wasn’t a prominent area. But, more important, as I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>described elsewhere</a>, for more than a century most physicists have effectively assumed that the foundations of the Second Law are a solved (or at least merely pedantic) problem.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Probably the single person with whom I had the most discussions about the foundations of the Second Law is Richard Feynman. But there are others with whom at one time or another I’ve discussed related issues, including: Bruce Boghosian, Richard Crandall, Roger Dashen, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Nigel Goldenfeld, Theodore Gray, Bill Hayes, Joel Lebowitz, David Levermore, Ed Lorenz, John Maddox, Roger Penrose, Ilya Prigogine, Rudy Rucker, David Ruelle, Rob Shaw, Yakov Sinai, Michael Trott, Léon van Hove and Larry Yaffe. (There are also many others with whom I’ve discussed general issues about origins of randomness.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Finally, one technical note about the presentation here: in an effort to maintain a clearer timeline, I’ve typically shown the earliest drafts or preprint versions of papers that I have. Their final published versions (if indeed they were ever published) appeared anything from weeks to years later, sometimes with changes.</p>\n",

The Tangled History of the Second Law of Thermodynamics\" width='620' height='315'></p>\n<p><!--Section 01 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='the-basic-arc-of-the-story'>The Basic Arc of the Story</h2>\n<p>As I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>explained elsewhere</a>, I think I now finally understand the Second Law of thermodynamics. But it’s a new understanding, and to get to it I’ve had to overcome a certain amount of conventional wisdom about the Second Law that I at least have long taken for granted. And to check myself I’ve been keen to know just where this conventional wisdom came from, how it’s been validated, and what might have made it go astray.</p>\n<p>And from this I’ve been led into a rather detailed examination of the origins and history of thermodynamics. All in all, it’s a fascinating story, that both explains what’s been believed about thermodynamics, and provides some powerful examples of the complicated dynamics of the development and acceptance of ideas.<span id=\"more-42402\"></span></p>\n<p>The basic concept of the Second Law was first formulated in the 1850s, and rather rapidly took on something close to its modern form. It began partly as an empirical law, and partly as something abstractly constructed on the basis of the idea of molecules, that nobody at the time knew for sure existed. But by the end of the 1800s, with the existence of molecules increasingly firmly established, the Second Law began to often be treated as an almost-mathematically-proven necessary law of physics. There were still mathematical loose ends, as well as issues such as its application to living systems and to systems involving gravity. But the almost-universal conventional wisdom became that the Second Law must always hold, and if it didn’t seem to in a particular case, then that must just be because there was something one didn’t yet understand about that case.</p>\n<p>There was also a sense that regardless of its foundations, the Second Law was successfully used in practice. And indeed particularly in chemistry and engineering it’s often been in the background, justifying all the computations routinely done using entropy. But despite its ubiquitous appearance in textbooks, when it comes to foundational questions, there’s always been a certain air of mystery around the Second Law. Though after 150 years there’s typically an assumption that “somehow it must all have been worked out”. I myself have been interested in the Second Law now for a little more than 50 years, and over that time I’ve had a growing awareness that actually, no, it hasn’t all been worked out. Which is why, now, it’s wonderful to see the computational paradigm—and ideas from our Physics Project—after all these years be able to provide solid foundations for understanding the Second Law, as well as seeing its limitations.</p>\n<p>And from the vantage point of the understanding we now have, we can go back and realize that there were precursors of it even from long ago. In some ways it’s all an inspiring tale—of how there were scientists with ideas ahead of their time, blocked only by the lack of a conceptual framework that would take another century to develop. But in other ways it’s also a cautionary tale, of how the forces of “conventional wisdom” can blind people to unanswered questions and—over a surprisingly long time—inhibit the development of new ideas.</p>\n<p>But, first and foremost, the story of the Second Law is the story of a great intellectual achievement of the mid-19th century. It’s exciting now, of course, to be able to use the latest 21st-century ideas to take another step. But to appreciate how this fits in with what’s already known we have to go back and study the history of what originally led to the Second Law, and how what emerged as conventional wisdom about it took shape.</p>\n<p><!--Section 2 What Is Heat?--></p>\n<h2 id='what-is-heat?'>What Is Heat?</h2>\n<p>Once it became clear what heat is, it actually didn’t take long for the Second Law to be formulated. But for centuries—and indeed until the mid-1800s—there was all sorts of confusion about the nature of heat. </p>\n<p>That there&#8217;s a distinction between hot and cold is a matter of basic human perception. And seeing fire one might imagine it as a disembodied form of heat. In ancient Greek times <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Heraclitus'>Heraclitus</a> (~500 BC) talked about everything somehow being &#8220;made of fire&#8221;, and also somehow being intrinsically &#8220;in motion”. <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Democritus/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Democritus</a> (~460–~370 BC) and the Epicureans had the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--atomism/'>important idea</a> (that also arose independently in other cultures) that everything might be made of large numbers of a few types of tiny discrete atoms. They imagined these atoms moving around in the &#8220;void&#8221; of space. And when it came to heat, they seem to have correctly associated it with the motion of atoms—though they imagined it came from particular spherical &#8220;fire&#8221; atoms that could slide more quickly between other atoms, and they also thought that souls were the ultimate sources of motion and heat (at least in warm-blooded animals?), and were made of fire atoms.</p>\n<p>And for two thousand years that&#8217;s pretty much where things stood. And indeed in 1623 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Galileo</a> (1564–1642) (in his book <em><a href='https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>The Assayer</a></em>, about weighing competing world theories) was <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.\\\npdf#page=25\" target=_blank rel=noopener>still saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Those materials which produce heat in us and make us feel warmth, which are known by the general name of “fire,” would then be a multitude of minute particles having certain shapes and moving with certain velocities. Meeting with our bodies, they penetrate by means of their extreme subtlety, and their touch as felt by us when they pass through our substance is the sensation we call “heat.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.\\\npdf#page=25\" target=_blank rel=noopener>goes on</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Since the presence of fire-corpuscles alone does not suffice to excite heat, but their motion is needed also, it seems to me that one may very reasonably say that motion is the cause of heat&#8230; But I hold it to be silly to accept that proposition in the ordinary way, as if a stone or piece of iron or a stick must heat up when moved. The rubbing together and friction of two hard bodies, either by resolving their parts into very subtle flying particles or by opening an exit for the tiny fire-corpuscles within, ultimately sets these in motion; and when they meet our bodies and penetrate them, our conscious mind feels those pleasant or unpleasant sensations which we have named heat&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And although he can tell there’s something different about it, he <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jsabol/certainty/readings/Galileo-Assayer.\\\npdf#page=20\" target=_blank rel=noopener>thinks of heat</a> as effectively being associated with a substance or material: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The tenuous material which produces heat is even more subtle than that which causes odor, for the latter cannot leak through a glass container, whereas the material of heat makes its way through any substance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 1620, <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Francis+Bacon'>Francis Bacon</a> (1561–1626) (in his “update on Aristotle”, <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/neworganonrelate0000baco_g3u2' target=_blank rel=noopener>The New Organon</a></em>) says, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/neworganonrelate0000baco_g3u2/page/156/\\\nmode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>a little more abstractly</a>, if obscurely—and without any reference to atoms or substances:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">[It is not] that heat generates motion or that motion generates heat (though both are true in certain cases), but that heat itself, its essence and quiddity, is motion and nothing else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But real progress in understanding the nature of heat had to wait for more understanding about the nature of gases, with air being the prime example. (It was actually only in the 1640s that any kind of general notion of gas began to emerge—with the word “gas” being invented by the “anti-Galen” physician <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Jan+Baptista+van+Helmont'>Jan Baptista van Helmont</a> (1580–1644), as a Dutch rendering of the Greek word “chaos”, that meant essentially “void”, or primordial formlessness.) Ever since antiquity there’d been Aristotle-style explanations like “nature abhors a vacuum” about what nature “wants to do”. But by the mid-1600s the idea was emerging that there could be more explicit and mechanical explanations for phenomena in the natural world.</p>\n<p>And in 1660 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boyle/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Robert Boyle</a> (1627–1691)—now thoroughly committed to the experimental approach to science—published <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/chepfl-lipr-AXA74/page/23/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>New Experiments Physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects</a></em> in which he argued that air has an intrinsic pressure associated with it, which pushes it to fill spaces, and for which he effectively found Boyle’s Law <em>PV</em> = constant.</p>\n<p>But what was air actually made of? Boyle had two basic hypotheses that he explained in rather flowery terms: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/chepfl-lipr-AXA74/page/23/mode/2up\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img1.png\" width='620' height='1161' /></a></p>\n<p>His first hypothesis was that air might be like a “fleece of wool” made of “aerial corpuscles” (gases were later often called “aeriform fluids”) with a “power or principle of self-dilatation” that resulted from there being “hairs” or “little springs” between these corpuscles. But he had a second hypothesis too—based, he said, on the ideas of “that most ingenious gentleman, Monsieur Descartes”: that instead air consists of “flexible particles” that are “so whirled around” that “each corpuscle endeavors to beat off all others”. In this second hypothesis, Boyle’s “spring of the air” was effectively the result of particles bouncing off each other.</p>\n<p>And, as it happens, in 1668 there was quite an effort to understand the “laws of impact” (that would for example be applicable to balls in games like croquet and billiards, that had existed since at least the 1300s, and were becoming popular), with <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wallis/' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Wallis</a> (1616–1703), <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wren/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Christopher Wren</a> (1632–1723) and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Huygens/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Christiaan Huygens</a> (1629–1695) all contributing, and Huygens producing diagrams like:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img2.png\" data-url=\"https://nature.berkeley.edu/departments/espm/env-hist/dissertation/ch_2.pdf\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img2.png\" width='472' height='384' /></a></p>\n<p>But while some understanding developed of what amount to impacts between pairs of hard spheres, there wasn’t the mathematical methodology—or probably the idea—to apply this to large collections of spheres.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in his 1687 <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Newton/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Isaac Newton</a> (1642–1727), wanting to analyze the properties of self-gravitating spheres of fluid, discussed the idea that fluids could in effect be made up of arrays of particles held apart by repulsive forces, as in Boyle&#8217;s first hypothesis. Newton had of course had great success with his 1/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> universal attractive force for gravity. But now he noted (writing originally in Latin) that with a 1/<em>r</em> repulsive force between particles in a fluid, he could essentially reproduce Boyle’s law: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img4.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/n7/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img4.png\" width='504' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>Newton discussed questions like whether one particle would “shield” others from the force, but <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/302/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>then concluded</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">But whether elastic fluids do really consist of particles so repelling each other, is a physical question.

There was one major exception, however, in 1738, when—as part of his eclectic mathematical career spanning probability theory, elasticity theory, biostatistics, economics and more—<a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Daniel/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Daniel Bernoulli</a> (1700–1782) published his book on hydrodynamics.

As it is well known that heat is intensified as the internal motion of the particles increases, it follows that any increase in the pressure of air that has not changed its volume indicates more intense motion of its particles, which is in agreement with our hypothesis&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But at the time, and in fact for more than a century thereafter, this wasn’t followed up.</p>\n<p>A large part of the reason seems to have been that people just assumed that heat ultimately had to have some kind of material existence; to think that it was merely a manifestation of microscopic motion was too abstract an idea. And then there was the observation of “radiant heat” (i.e. infrared radiation)—that seemed like it could only work by explicitly transferring some kind of “heat material” from one body to another.</p>\n<p>But what was this “heat material”? It was thought of as a fluid—called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory' target=_blank rel=noopener>caloric</a>—that could suffuse matter, and for example flow from a hotter body to a colder. And in an echo of Democritus, it was often assumed that caloric consisted of particles that could slide between ordinary particles of matter. There was some thought that it might be related to the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory' target=_blank rel=noopener>phlogiston</a> from the mid-1600s, that was effectively a chemical substance, for example participating in chemical reactions or being generated in combustion (through the “principle of fire”). But the more mainstream view was that there were caloric particles that would collect around ordinary particles of matter (often called “molecules”, after the use of that term by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Descartes/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Descartes</a> (1596–1650) in 1620), generating a repulsive force that would for example expand gases—and that in various circumstances these caloric particles would move around, corresponding to the transfer of heat.</p>\n<p>To us today it might seem hacky and implausible (perhaps a little like dark matter, cosmological inflation, etc.), but the caloric theory lasted for more than two hundred years and managed to explain plenty of phenomena—and indeed was certainly going strong in 1825 when Laplace wrote his <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/treatiseofcelest12lapl/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>A Treatise of Celestial Mechanics</a></em>, which included a successful computation of properties of gases like the speed of sound and the ratio of specific heats, on the basis of a somewhat elaborated and mathematicized version of caloric theory (that by then included the concept of “caloric rays” associated with radiant heat).</p>\n<p>But even though it wasn’t understood what heat ultimately was, one could still measure its attributes. Already in antiquity there were devices that made use of heat to produce pressure or mechanical motion. And by the beginning of the 1600s—catalyzed by Galileo’s development of the thermoscope (in which heated liquid could be seen to expand up a tube)—the idea quickly caught on of making thermometers, and of quantitatively measuring temperature.</p>\n<p>And given a measurement of temperature, one could correlate it with effects one saw. So, for example, in the late 1700s the French balloonist <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles' target=_blank rel=noopener>Jacques Charles</a> (1746–1823) noted the linear increase of volume of a gas with temperature. Meanwhile, at the beginning of the 1800s <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fourier/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Joseph Fourier</a> (1768–1830) (science advisor to Napoleon) developed what became his 1822 <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00jose/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Analytical Theory of Heat</em></a>, and in it he begins <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00jose/page/n33/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>by noting that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Heat, like gravity, penetrates every substance of the universe, its rays occupy all parts of space. The object of our work is to set forth the mathematical laws which this element obeys. The theory of heat will hereafter form one of the most important branches of general physics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later he describes what he calls the “Principle of the Communication of Heat”. He refers to “molecules”—though basically just to indicate a small amount of substance—and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/analyticaltheory00jose/page/n11/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">When two molecules of the same solid are extremely near and at unequal temperatures, the most heated molecule communicates to that which is less heated a quantity of heat exactly expressed by the product of the duration of the instant, of the extremely small difference of the temperatures, and of certain function of the distance of the molecules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>then goes on to develop what’s now called the heat equation and all sorts of mathematics around it, all the while effectively adopting a caloric theory of heat. (And, yes, if you think of heat as a fluid it does lead you to describe its “motion” in <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/HeatTransferPDEModels.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>terms of differential equations</a> just like Fourier did. Though it’s then ironic that Bernoulli, even though he studied hydrodynamics, seemed to have a less “fluid-based” view of heat.)</p>\n<p><!--Section 3 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='heat-engines-and-the-beginnings-of-thermodynamics'>Heat Engines and the Beginnings of Thermodynamics</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the 1800s the Industrial Revolution was in full swing—driven in no small part by the availability of <a href='https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-why-wasnt-the-steam' target=_blank rel=noopener>increasingly efficient steam engines</a>. There had been precursors of steam engines even in antiquity, but it was only in 1712 that the first practical steam engine was developed. And after <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=james+watt'>James Watt</a> (1736–1819) produced a much more efficient version in 1776, the adoption of steam engines began to take off. </p>\n<p>Over the years that followed there were all sorts of engineering innovations that increased the efficiency of steam engines. But it wasn’t clear how far it could go—and whether for example there was a limit to how much mechanical work could ever, even in principle, be derived from a given amount of heat. And it was the investigation of this question—in the hands of a young French engineer named <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Carnot_Sadi/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sadi Carnot</a> (1796–1832)—that began the development of an abstract basic science of thermodynamics, and to the Second Law.</p>\n<p>The story really begins with Sadi Carnot&#8217;s father, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Carnot/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lazare Carnot</a> (1753–1823), who was trained as an engineer but ascended to the highest levels of French politics, and was involved with both the French Revolution and Napoleon. Particularly in years when he was out of political favor, Lazare Carnot worked on mathematics and mathematical engineering. His first significant work—in 1778—was entitled <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/lazarecarnotsava0000gill/page/270/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Memoir on the Theory of Machines</a></em>. The mathematical and geometrical science of mechanics was by then fairly well developed; Lazare Carnot&#8217;s objective was to understand its consequences for actual engineering machines, and to somehow abstract general principles from the mechanical details of the operation of those machines. In 1803 (alongside <a href='https://archive.org/details/deladfensedespla00carn/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>works on the geometrical theory of fortifications</a>) he published his <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/principesfondam02carngoog/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fundamental Principles of [Mechanical] Equilibrium and Movement</a></em>, which argued for what was at one time called (in a strange foreshadowing of reversible thermodynamic processes) &#8220;Carnot&#8217;s Principle&#8221;: that useful work in a machine will be maximized if accelerations and shocks of moving parts are minimized—and that a machine with perpetual motion is impossible. </p>\n<p>Sadi Carnot was born in 1796, and was largely educated by his father until he went to college in 1812. It’s notable that during the years when Sadi Carnot was a kid, one of his father’s activities was to give opinions on a whole range of inventions—including many steam engines and their generalizations. Lazare Carnot died in 1823. Sadi Carnot was by that point a well-educated but professionally undistinguished French military engineer. But in 1824, at the age of 28, he produced his one published work, <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QX9iIWF3yOMC/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, and on Machines to Develop That Power</a></em> (where by “fire” he meant what we would call heat):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img8.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/n25/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img8.png\" width='624' height='293' /></a></p>\n<p>The style and approach of the younger Carnot’s work is quite similar to his father’s. But the subject matter turned out to be more fruitful. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/3/mode/\\1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>The book begins</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Everyone knows that heat can produce motion. That it possesses vast motive-power none can doubt, in these days when the steam-engine is everywhere so well known&#8230; The study of these engines is of the greatest interest, their importance is enormous, their use is continually increasing, and they seem destined to produce a great revolution in the civilized world. Already the steam-engine works our mines, impels our ships, excavates our ports and our rivers, forges iron, fashions wood, grinds grain, spins and weaves our cloths, transports the heaviest burdens, etc. It appears that it must some day serve as a universal motor, and be substituted for animal power, water-falls, and air currents. &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Notwithstanding the work of all kinds done by steam-engines, notwithstanding the satisfactory condition to which they have been brought to-day, their theory is very little understood, and the attempts to improve them are still directed almost by chance. &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The question has often been raised whether the motive power of heat is unbounded, whether the possible improvements in steam-engines have an assignable limit, a limit which the nature of things will not allow to be passed by any means whatever; or whether, on the contrary, these improvements may be carried on indefinitely. We propose now to submit these questions to a deliberate examination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carnot operated very much within the framework of caloric theory, and indeed his ideas were crucially based on the concept that one could think about “heat itself” (which for him was caloric fluid), independent of the material substance (like steam) that was hot. But—like his father’s efforts with mechanical machines—his goal was to develop an abstract “metamodel” of something like a steam engine, crucially assuming that the generation of unbounded heat or mechanical work (i.e. perpetual motion) in the closed cycle of the operation of the machine was impossible, and noting (again with a reflection of his father’s work) that the system would necessarily maximize efficiency if it operated reversibly. And he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/7/mode/\\1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>then argued that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The production of motive power is then due in steam-engines not to an actual consumption of caloric, but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body, that is, to its re-establishment of equilibrium&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, what was important about a steam engine was that it was a “heat engine”, that “moved heat around”. His book is mostly words, with just a few formulas related to the behavior of ideal gases, and some tables of actual parameters for particular materials. But even though his underlying conceptual framework—of caloric theory—was not correct, the abstract arguments that he made (that involved essentially logical consequences of reversibility and of operating in a closed cycle) were robust enough that it didn’t matter, and in particular he was able to successfully show that there was a theoretical maximum efficiency for a heat engine, that depended only on the temperatures of its hot and cold reservoirs of heat. But what’s important for our purposes here is that in the setup Carnot constructed he basically ended up introducing the Second Law.</p>\n<p>At the time it appeared, however, Carnot’s book was basically ignored, and Carnot died in obscurity from cholera in 1832 (about 9 months after <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galois/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Évariste Galois</a> (1811–1832)) at the age of 36. (The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadi_Carnot_(statesman)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sadi Carnot</a> who would later become president of France was his nephew.) But in 1834, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Clapeyron/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Émile Clapeyron</a> (1799–1864)—a rather distinguished French engineering professor (and steam engine designer)—wrote a paper entitled “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/100/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Memoir on the Motive Power of Heat</a>”. He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonmot0000carn_a8p6/page/74/\\mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>starts off by saying</a> about Carnot’s book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The idea which serves as a basis of his researches seems to me to be both fertile and beyond question; his demonstrations are founded on the absurdity of the possibility of creating motive power or heat out of nothing. … </p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">This new method of demonstration seems to me worthy of the attention of theoreticians; it seems to me to be free of all objection …</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I believe that it is of some interest to take up this theory again; S.

But what else might also be conserved? In the 1680s <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Gottfried Leibniz</a> (1646–1716) suggested the quantity <em>m v</em><sup>2</sup>, which he called, rather grandly, <em>vis viva—</em>or, in English, “life force”. And yes, in things like elastic collisions, this quantity did seem to be conserved. But in plenty of situations it wasn’t. By 1807 the term “energy” had been introduced, but the question remained of whether it could in any sense globally be thought of as conserved.</p>\n<p>It had seemed for a long time that heat was something a bit like mechanical energy, but the relation wasn’t clear—and the caloric theory of heat implied that caloric (i.e. the fluid corresponding to heat) was conserved, and so certainly wasn’t something that for example could be interconverted with mechanical energy. But in 1798 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Benjamin+Thompson+%28Count+Rumford%29'>Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford)</a> (1753–1814) measured the heat produced by the mechanical process of boring a cannon, and began to make the argument that, in contradiction to the caloric theory, there was actually some kind of correspondence between mechanical energy and amount of heat.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t a very accurate experiment, and it took until the 1840s—with new experiments by the English brewer and “amateur” scientist <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=James+Joule'>James Joule</a> (1818–1889) and the German physician <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Robert+Mayer'>Robert Mayer</a> (1814–1878)—before the idea of some kind of equivalence between heat and mechanical work began to look more plausible. And in 1847 this was something <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Thomson/' target=_blank rel=noopener>William Thomson</a> (1824–1907) (later Lord Kelvin)—a prolific young physicist recently graduated from the Mathematical Tripos in Cambridge and now installed as a professor of “natural philosophy” (i.e. physics) in Glasgow—began to be curious about.</p>\n<p>But first we have to go back a bit in the story. In 1845 Kelvin (as we’ll call him) had spent some time in Paris (primarily at at a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Victor_Regnault' target=_blank rel=noopener>lab that was measuring properties of steam</a> for the French government), and there he’d learned about Carnot’s work from Clapeyron’s paper (at first he couldn’t get a copy of Carnot’s actual book). Meanwhile, one of the issues of the time was a proliferation of different temperature scales based on using different kinds of thermometers based on different substances. And in 1848 Kelvin realized that Carnot’s concept of a “pure heat engine”—assumed at the time to be based on caloric—could be used to define an “absolute” scale of temperature in which, for example, at absolute zero all caloric would have been removed from all substances: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img12.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp33lond/page/312/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img12.png\" width='584' height='429' /></a></p>\n<p>Having found Carnot’s ideas useful, Kelvin in 1849 wrote a 33-page summary of them (small world that it was then, the immediately preceding paper in the journal is “<a href='https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/518/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Theory of Rolling Curves</a>”, written by the then-17-year-old <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Maxwell/' target=_blank rel=noopener>James Clerk Maxwell</a> (1831–1879), while the one that follows is “Theoretical Considerations on the Effect of Pressure in Lowering the Freezing Point of Water” by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Thomson_James/' target=_blank rel=noopener>James Thomson</a> (1786–1849), engineering-oriented older brother of William):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img13.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img13.png\" width='584' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He characterizes Carnot’s work as being based not so much on physics and experiment, but on the “strictest principles of philosophy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img14.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img14.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He doesn’t immediately mention “caloric” (though it does slip in later), referring instead to a vaguer concept of “thermal agency”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img15.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img15.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"84\" /></a></p>\n<p>In keeping with the idea that this is more philosophy than experimental science, he refers to “Carnot’s fundamental principle”—that after a complete cycle an engine can be treated as back in the “same state”—while adding the footnote that “this is tacitly assumed as an axiom”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img16.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro16roy/page/540/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img16.png\" width=\"584\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>In actuality, to say that an engine comes back to the same state is a nontrivial statement of the existence of some kind of unique equilibrium in the system, related to the Second Law.

By 1849 a new idea had emerged: that perhaps heat was itself a form of energy, and that, when heat was accounted for, the total energy of a system would always be conserved. And what this suggested was that heat was somehow a dynamical phenomenon, associated with microscopic motion—which in turn suggested that gases might indeed consist just of molecules in motion.</p>\n<p>And so it was that in 1850 Kelvin (then still “William Thomson”) wrote a long exposition “On the Dynamical Theory of Heat”, attempting to reconcile Carnot’s ideas with the new concept that heat was dynamical in origin:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img21.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro20royal/page/260/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img21.png\" width='620' height='635' /></a></p>\n<p>He begins by quoting—presumably for some kind of “British-based authority”—an “anti-caloric” experiment apparently done by <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Humphry+Davy'>Humphry Davy</a> (1778–1829) as a teenager, involving melting pieces of ice by rubbing them together, and included anonymously in a 1799 list of pieces of knowledge “principally from the west of England”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img22.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/contributionsto00beddgoog/page/n8/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img22.png\" width='552' height='414' /></a></p>\n<p>But soon Kelvin is getting to the main point:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img23.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/10/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img23.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then we have it: a statement of the Second Law (albeit with some hedging to which we’ll come back later):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img24.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/12/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img24.png\" width='620' height='126' /></a></p>\n<p>And there’s immediately a footnote that basically asserts the “absurdity” of a Second-Law-violating perpetual motion machine:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img25.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/12/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img25.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But by the next page we find out that Kelvin admits he’s in some sense been “scooped”—by a certain <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Clausius/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Rudolf Clausius</a> (1822–1888), who we’ll be discussing soon. But what’s remarkable is that Clausius’s “axiom” turns out to be exactly equivalent to Kelvin’s statement:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img26.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img26.png\" width='620' height='353' /></a></p>\n<p>And what this suggests is that the underlying concept—the Second Law—is something quite robust. And indeed, as Kelvin implies, it’s the main thing that ultimately underlies Carnot’s results. And so even though Carnot is operating on the now-outmoded idea of caloric theory, his main results are still correct, because in the end all they really depend on is a certain amount of “logical structure”, together with the Second Law (and a version of the First Law, but that’s a slightly trickier story).</p>\n<p>Kelvin recognized, though, that Carnot had chosen to look at the particular (“equilibrium thermodynamics”) case of processes that occur reversibly, effectively at an infinitesimal rate. And at the end of the first installment of his exposition, he explains that things will be more complicated if finite rates are considered—and that in particular the results one gets in such cases will depend on things like having a correct model for the nature of heat.</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s exposition on the “dynamical nature of heat” runs to four installments, and the next two dive into detailed derivations and attempted comparison with experiment:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img27.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/174/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img27.png\" width='538' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But before Kelvin gets to publish part four of his exposition he publishes two other pieces. In the first, he’s talking about sources of energy for human use (now that he believes energy is conserved):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img28.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy03roya/page/108/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img28.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He emphasizes that the Sun is—directly or indirectly—the main source of energy on Earth (later he’ll argue that coal will run out, etc.):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img29.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy03roya/page/112/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img29.png\" width='620' height='326' /></a></p>\n<p>But he wonders how animals actually manage to produce mechanical work, noting that “the animal body does not act as a thermo-dynamic engine; and [it is] very probable that the chemical forces produce the external mechanical effects through electrical means”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img30.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy03roya/page/112/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img30.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then, by April 1852, he’s back to thinking directly about the Second Law, and he’s cut through the technicalities, and is stating the Second Law in everyday (if slightly ponderous) terms:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img31.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/304/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img31.png\" width='620' height='878' /><a></p>\n<p>It’s interesting to see his apparently rather deeply held Presbyterian beliefs manifest themselves here in his mention that “Creative Power” is what must set the total energy of the universe. He ends his piece with:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img32.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/306/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img32.png\" width='620' height='350' /></a></p>\n<p>In (2) the hedging is interesting. He makes the definitive assertion that what amounts to a violation of the Second Law “is impossible in inanimate material processes”. And he’s pretty sure the same is true for “vegetable life” (recognizing that in his previous paper he discussed the harvesting of sunlight by plants). But what about “animal life”, like us humans? Here he says that “by our will” we can’t violate the Second Law—so we can’t, for example, build a machine to do it. But he leaves it open whether we as humans might have some innate (“God-given”?) ability to overcome the Second Law. </p>\n<p>And then there’s his (3). It’s worth realizing that his whole paper is less than 3 pages long, and right before his conclusions we’re seeing triple integrals: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img33.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/306/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img33.png\" width='620' height='313' /></a></p>\n<p>So what is (3) about? It’s presumably something like a Second-Law-implies-heat-death-of-the-universe statement (but what’s this stuff about the past?)—but with an added twist that there’s something (God?) beyond the “known operations going on at present in the material world” that might be able to swoop in to save the world for us humans.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take people long to pick up on the “cosmic significance” of all this. But in the fall of 1852, Kelvin’s colleague, the Glasgow engineering professor <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Rankine/' target=_blank rel=noopener>William Rankine</a> (1820–1872) (who was deeply involved with the First Law of thermodynamics), is writing about a way the universe might save itself:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img34.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/358/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img34.png\" width='620' height='230' /></a></p>\n<p>After touting the increasingly solid evidence for energy conservation and the First Law</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img35.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/358/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img35.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n<p>he goes on to talk about dissipation of energy and what we now call the Second Law</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img36.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/358/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img36.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"291\" /></a></p>\n<p>and the fact that it implies an “end of all physical phenomena”, i.e. heat death of the universe.

He believes that there must exist a “medium capable of transmitting light and heat”, i.e. an aether, “[between] the heavenly bodies”. And if this aether can’t itself acquire heat, he concludes that all energy must be converted into a radiant form:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img38.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/360/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img38.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now he supposes that the universe is effectively a giant drop of aether, with nothing outside, so that all this radiant energy will get totally internally reflected from its surface, allowing the universe to “[reconcentrate] its physical energies, and [renew] its activity and life”—and save it from heat death:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img39.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/360/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img39.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"496\" /></a></p>\n<p>He ends with the speculation that perhaps “some of the luminous objects which we see in distant regions of space may be, not stars, but foci in the interstellar aether”.</p>\n<p>But independent of cosmic speculations, Kelvin himself continues to study the “dynamical theory of gases”. It’s often a bit unclear what’s being assumed. There’s the First Law (energy conservation). And the Second Law. But there’s also reversibility. Equilibrium. And the ideal gas law (<em>P V</em> = <em>R T</em>). But it soon becomes clear that that’s not always correct for real gases—as the Joule–Thomson effect demonstrates: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img40.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/480/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img40.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kelvin soon returned to more cosmic speculations, suggesting that perhaps gravitation—rather than direct “Creative Power”—might “in reality [be] the ultimate created antecedent of all motion&#8230;”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img41.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/report47sciegoog/page/58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img41.png\" width='620' height='228' /></a></p>\n<p>Not long after these papers Kelvin got involved with the practical “electrical” problem of laying a transatlantic telegraph cable, and in 1858 was on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable' target=_blank rel=noopener>the ship that first succeeded in doing this</a>.

But he continued to write physics papers, which ranged over many different areas, occasionally touching thermodynamics, though most often in the service of answering a “general science” question—like <a href='https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro21royal/page/78/mode/2up?q=32' target=_blank rel=noopener>how old the Sun is</a> (he estimated 32,000 years from thermodynamic arguments, though of course without knowledge of nuclear reactions).</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s ideas about the inevitable dissipation of “useful energy” spread quickly—by 1854, for example, finding their way into an eloquent public lecture by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Helmholtz/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Hermann von Helmholtz</a> (1821–1894). Helmholtz had trained as a doctor, becoming in 1843 a surgeon to a German military regiment. But he was also doing experiments and developing theories about “animal heat” and how muscles manage to “do mechanical work”, for example publishing an 1845 paper entitled “<a href='https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/50072#page/302/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On Metabolism during Muscular Activity</a>”. And in 1847 he was one of the inventors of the law of conservation of energy—and the First Law of thermodynamics—as well as perhaps its clearest expositor at the time (the word “force” in the title is what we now call “energy”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img42.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_qu44AAAAMAAJ/page/n3/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img42.png\" width='620' height='745' /></a></p>\n<p>By 1854 Helmholtz was a physiology professor, beginning a distinguished career in physics, psychophysics and physiology—and talking about the Second Law and its implications.

But let&#8217;s turn now to Rudolf Clausius, who in 1850 at least to some extent &#8220;scooped&#8221; Kelvin on the Second Law. At that time Clausius was a freshly minted German physics PhD. His thesis had been on an ingenious but <a href='https://archive.org/details/journalfrdierei109crelgoog/page/n129/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>ultimately incorrect theory of why the sky is blue</a>. But he&#8217;d also <a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1849_76_1/page/46/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>worked on elasticity theory</a>, and there he&#8217;d been led to start thinking about molecules and their configurations in materials. By 1850 caloric theory had become fairly elaborate, complete with concepts like &#8220;latent heat&#8221; (bound to molecules) and &#8220;free heat&#8221; (able to be transferred). Clausius&#8217;s experience in elasticity theory made him skeptical, and knowing Mayer&#8217;s and Joule&#8217;s results he decided to break with the caloric theory—writing his career-launching paper (translated from German in 1851, with Carnot&#8217;s <em>puissance motrice</em> [&#8220;motive power&#8221;] being rendered as &#8220;moving force&#8221;):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img50.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghd02lond/page/n13/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img50.png\" alt='' title='' width='550' height='435' /></a></p>\n<p>The first installment of the English version of the paper gives a clear description of the ideal gas laws and the Carnot cycle, having started from a statement of the “caloric-busting” First Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img51.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghd02lond/page/4/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img51.png\" width='550' height='285' /></a></p>\n<p>The general discussion continues in the second installment, but now there’s a critical side comment that describes the “general deportment of heat, which every-where exhibits the tendency to annul differences of temperature, and therefore to pass from a warmer body to a colder one”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img52.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghd02lond/page/102/mode/2up?q=clausius&#038;view=theater\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img52.png\" width='550' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Clausius “has” the Second Law, as Carnot basically did before him. But when Kelvin quotes Clausius he does so much more forcefully:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img53.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga/page/14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img53.png\" width='620' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>But there it is: by 1852 the Second Law is out in the open, in at least two different forms. The path to reach it has been circuitous and quite technical. But in the end, stripped of its technical origins, the law seems somehow unsurprising and even obvious. For it’s a matter of common experience that heat flows from hotter bodies to colder ones, and that motion is dissipated by friction into heat. But the point is that it wasn’t until basically 1850 that the overall scientific framework existed to make it useful—or even really possible—to enunciate such observations as a formal scientific law.</p>\n<p>Of course the fact that a law “seems true” based on common experience doesn’t mean it’ll always be true, and that there won’t be some special circumstance or elaborate construction that will evade it. But somehow the very fact that the Second Law had in a sense been “technically hard won”—yet in the end seemed so “obvious”—appears to have given it a sense of inevitability and certainty. And it didn’t hurt that somehow it seemed to have emerged from Carnot’s work, which had a certain air of “logical necessity”. (Of course, in reality, the Second Law entered Carnot’s logical structure as an “axiom”.) But all this helped set the stage for some of the curious confusions about the Second Law that would develop over the century that followed.</p>\n<p><!--Section 5 The Concept of Entropy--></p>\n<h2 id='the-concept-of-entropy'>The Concept of Entropy</h2>\n<p>In the first half of the 1850s the Second Law had in a sense been presented in two ways. First, as an almost “footnote-style” assumption needed to support the “pure thermodynamics” that had grown out of Carnot’s work. And second, as an explicitly-stated-for-the-first-time—if “obvious”—“everyday” feature of nature, that was now realized as having potentially cosmic significance. But an important feature of the decade that followed was a certain progressive at-least-phenomenological “mathematicization” of the Second Law—pursued most notably by Rudolf Clausius.</p>\n<p>In 1854 Clausius was already beginning this process. Perhaps confusingly, he refers to the Second Law as the &#8220;second fundamental theorem [<em>Hauptsatz</em>]&#8221; in the &#8220;mechanical theory of heat&#8221;—suggesting it&#8217;s something that is proved, even though it&#8217;s really introduced just as an empirical law of nature, or perhaps a theoretical axiom:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img54.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n131/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img54.png\" width='580' height='458' /></a></p>\n<p>He starts off by discussing the “first fundamental theorem”, i.e. the First Law. And he emphasizes that this implies that there’s a quantity <em>U</em> (which we now call “internal energy”) that is a pure “function of state”—so that its value depends only on the state of a system, and not the path by which that state was reached. And as an “application” of this, he then points out that the overall change in <em>U</em> in a cyclic process (like the one executed by Carnot’s heat engine) must be zero.</p>\n<p>And now he’s ready to tackle the Second Law. He gives a statement that at first seems somewhat convoluted:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img55.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n137/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img55.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But soon he’s deriving this from a more “everyday” statement of the Second Law (which, notably, is clearly not a “theorem” in any normal sense):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img56.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n137/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img56.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>After giving a Carnot-style argument he’s then got a new statement (that he calls “the theorem of the equivalence of transformations”) of the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img57.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n145/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img57.png\" width='580' height='365' /></a></p>\n<p>And there it is: basically what we now call entropy (even with the same notation of <em>Q</em> for heat and <em>T</em> for temperature)—together with the statement that this quantity is a function of state, so that its differences are “independent of the nature of the process by which the transformation is effected”.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon there’s a familiar expression for entropy change:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img58.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n147/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img58.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And by the next page he’s giving what he describes as “the analytical expression” of the Second Law, for the particular case of reversible cyclic processes:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img59.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n149/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img59.png\" width='580' height='142' /></a></p>\n<p>A bit later he backs out of the assumption of reversibility, concluding that:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img60.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n153/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img60.png\" width='580' height='48' /></a></p>\n<p>(And, yes, with modern mathematical rigor, that should be “non-negative” rather than “positive”.)</p>\n<p>He goes on to say that if something has changed after going around a cycle, he’ll call that an “uncompensated transformation”—or what we would now refer to as an irreversible change. He lists a few possible (now very familiar) examples:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img61.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n153/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img61.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"211\" /></a></p>\n<p>Earlier in his paper he’s careful to say that <em>T</em> is “a function of temperature”; he doesn’t say it’s actually the quantity we measure as temperature. But now he wants to determine what it is:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img62.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mechanicaltheor04claugoog/page/n155/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img62.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He doesn’t talk about the ultimately critical assumption (effectively the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Zeroth+Law+of+Thermodynamics'>Zeroth Law of thermodynamics</a>) that the system is “in equilibrium”, with a uniform temperature. But he uses an ideal gas as a kind of “standard material”, and determines that, yes, in that case <em>T</em> can be simply the absolute temperature.</p>\n<p>So there it is: in 1854 Clausius has effectively defined entropy and described its relation to the Second Law, though everything is being done in a very “heat-engine” style. And pretty soon he’s writing about “Theory of the Steam-Engine” and filling actual approximate steam tables into his theoretical formulas:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img63.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/s4philosophicalmag12londuoft/page/240/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img63.png\" width='620' height='528' /></a></p>\n<p>After a few years “off” (working, as we’ll discuss later, on the kinetic theory of gases) Clausius is back in 1862 talking about the Second Law again, in terms of his “theorem of the equivalence of transformations”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img64.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/72/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img64.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He’s slightly tightened up his 1854 discussion, but, more importantly, he’s now stating a result not just for reversible cyclic processes, but for general ones:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img65.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/76/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img65.png\" width='580' height='357' /></a></p>\n<p>But what does this result really mean? Clausius claims that this “theorem admits of strict mathematical proof if we start from the fundamental proposition above quoted”—though it’s not particularly clear just what that proposition is. But then he says he wants to find a “physical cause”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img66.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/76/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img66.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>A little earlier in the paper he said:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img67.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/74/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img67.png\" width='580' height='214' /></a></p>\n<p>So what does he think the “physical cause” is? He says that even from his first investigations he’d assumed a general law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img68.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/78/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img68.png\" width='580' height='86' /></a></p>\n<p>What are these “resistances”? He’s basically saying they are the forces between molecules in a material (which from his work on the kinetic theory of gases he now imagines exist):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img69.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/78/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img69.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He introduces what he calls the “disgregation” to represent the microscopic effect of adding heat:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img1.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/78/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img1.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>For ideal gases things are straightforward, including the proportionality of “resistance” to absolute temperature. But in other cases, it’s not so clear what’s going on. A decade later he identifies “disgregation” with average kinetic energy per molecule—which is indeed proportional to absolute temperature. But in 1862 it’s all still quite muddy, with somewhat curious statements like:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img70.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/100/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img70.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then the main part of the paper ends with what seems to be an anticipation of the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Third+Law+of+Thermodynamics'>Third Law of thermodynamics</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img71.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1862_116_5/page/112/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img71.png\" alt='' title='' width='580' height='139' /></a></p>\n<p>There’s an appendix entitled “On Terminology” which admits that between Clausius’s own work, and other people’s, it’s become rather difficult to follow what’s going on. He agrees that the term “energy” that Kelvin is using makes sense. He suggests “energy of the body” for what he calls <em>U</em> and we now call “internal energy”. He suggests “heat of the body” or “thermal content of the body” for <em>Q</em>. But then he talks about the fact that these are measured in thermal units (say the amount of heat needed to increase the temperature of water by 1°), while mechanical work is measured in units related to kilograms and meters.

Or was it something more dynamical, and in a sense more abstract? But then we saw how Carnot—followed by Kelvin and Clausius—managed in effect to sidestep the question, and come up with all sorts of “thermodynamic conclusions”, by talking just about “what heat does” without ever really having to seriously address the question of “what heat is”. But to be able to discuss the foundations of the Second Law—and what it says about heat—we have to know more about what heat actually is. And the crucial development that began to clarify the nature of heat was the kinetic theory of gases.</p>\n<p>Central to the kinetic theory of gases is the idea that gases are made up of discrete molecules. And it’s important to remember that it wasn’t until the beginning of the 1900s that anyone knew for sure that molecules existed. Yes, something like them had been discussed ever since antiquity, and in the 1800s there was increasing “circumstantial evidence” for them. But nobody had directly “seen a molecule”, or been able, for example, until about 1870, to even guess what the size of molecules might be. Still, by the mid-1800s it had become common for physicists to talk and reason in terms of ordinary matter at least effectively being made of up molecules.</p>\n<p>But if a gas was made of molecules bouncing off each other like billiard balls according to the laws of mechanics, what would its overall properties be? <a href=\"https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Daniel/\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Daniel Bernoulli</a> had in 1738 already worked out the basic answer that pressure would vary inversely with volume, or in his notation, π = <em>P</em>/<em>s</em> (and he even also gave formulas for molecules of nonzero size—in a precursor of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all'>van der Waals</a>): </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img79.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_3yRVAAAAcAAJ/page/n215/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img79.png\" width='492' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Results like Bernouilli’s would be rediscovered several times, for example in 1820 by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herapath' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Herapath</a> (1790–1868), a math teacher in England, who developed a fairly elaborate theory that purported to describe gravity as well as heat (but for example implied a <em>P V</em> = <em>a T</em><sup>2</sup> gas law):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img80.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/annalsofphilosop01lond/page/400/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img80.png\" width='568' height='76' /></a></p>\n<p>Then there was the case of <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Waterston/' target=_blank rel=noopener>John Waterston</a> (1811–1883), a naval instructor for the East India company, who in 1843 published a book called <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/b29487468/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Thoughts on the Mental Functions</a></em>, which included results on what he called the “<em>vis viva</em> theory of heat”—that he developed in more detail in a paper he wrote in 1846. But when he submitted the paper to the Royal Society it was rejected as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, and its manuscript was &#8220;lost&#8221; until 1891 when it was finally published (with an “explanation” of the “delay”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img81.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/philtrans04661231\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img81.png\" width='604' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The paper had included a perfectly sensible mathematical analysis that included a derivation of the kinetic theory relation between pressure and mean-square molecular velocity:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img82.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/philtrans04661231/page/n41/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img82.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='604' height='391' /></a></p>\n<p>But with all these pieces of work unknown, it fell to a German high-school chemistry teacher (and sometime professor and <a href='https://books.google.com/books/about/Das_dasein_Gottes_und_das_Gl%C3%BCck_der_Men.html?id=pcBgAAAAcAAJ' target=_blank rel=noopener>philosophical/theological writer</a>) named <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=August+Kr%C3%B6nig'>August Krönig</a> (1822–1879) to publish in 1856 yet another “rediscovery”, that he entitled “Principles of a Theory of Gases”. He said it was going to analyze the “mechanical theory of heat”, and once again he wanted to compute the pressure associated with colliding molecules. But to simplify the math, he assumed that molecules went only along the coordinate directions, at a fixed speed—almost anticipating a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-road-from-ordinary-thermodynamics'>cellular automaton fluid</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img83.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1856_99_10/page/314/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img83.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='520' height='1104' /></a></p>\n<p>What ultimately launched the subsequent development of the kinetic theory of gases, however, was the 1857 publication by Rudolf Clausius (by then an increasingly established German physics professor) of a paper entitled rather poetically “<a href='https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp14maga/page/108/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Nature of the Motion Which We Call Heat</a>” (“<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1857_100_3/mode/2up\" rel=noopener>Über die Art der Bewegung die wir Wärme nennen</a>”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img84.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp14maga/page/108/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img84.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='620' height='569' /></a></p>\n<p>It’s a clean and clear paper, with none of the mathematical muddiness around Clausius’s work on the Second Law (which, by the way, isn’t even mentioned in this paper even though Clausius had recently worked on it).

For some reason, Maxwell doesn&#8217;t want to think of molecules, as he did before, as hard spheres.

In 1871, a few years before he died at age 48, he wrote a textbook entitled <em><a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Theory of Heat</a></em>, which begins, in erudite fashion, discussing what &#8220;thermodynamics&#8221; should even be called:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img116.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=22\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img116.png\" width='550' height='142' /></a></p>\n<p>Most of the book is concerned with the macroscopic &#8220;theory of heat&#8221;—though, as we&#8217;ll discuss later, in the very last chapter Maxwell does talk about the &#8220;molecular theory&#8221;, if in somewhat tentative terms.</p>\n<p><!--Section 7 \"Deriving\" the Second Law from Molecular Dynamics--></p>\n<h2 id='deriving-the-second-law-from-molecular-dynamics'>&#8220;Deriving&#8221; the Second Law from Molecular Dynamics</h2>\n<p>The Second Law was in effect originally introduced as a formalization of everyday observations about heat. But the development of kinetic theory seemed to open up the possibility that the Second Law could actually be proved from the underlying mechanics of molecules. And this was something that <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boltzmann/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ludwig Boltzmann</a> (1844–1906) embarked on towards the end of his physics PhD at the University of Vienna. In 1865 he’d published his first paper (“<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=15%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-19' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Movement of Electricity on Curved Surfaces</a>”), and in 1866 he published his second paper, “On the Mechanical Meaning of the Second Law of Thermodynamics”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img117.png\" data-url=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=23%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-27\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img117.png\" width='548' height='194' /></a></p>\n<p>The introduction promises “a purely analytical, perfectly general proof of the Second Law”. And what he seemed to imagine was that the equations of mechanics would somehow inevitably lead to motion that would reproduce the Second Law. And in a sense what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>computational irreducibility, rule 30, etc. now show</a> is that in the end that’s indeed basically how things work. But the methods and conceptual framework that Boltzmann had at his disposal were very far away from being able to see that. And instead what Boltzmann did was to use standard mathematical methods from mechanics to compute average properties of cyclic mechanical motions—and then made the somewhat unconvincing claim that combinations of these averages could be related (e.g. via temperature as average kinetic energy) to “Clausius’s entropy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img118.png\" data-url=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=43%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-49\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img118.png\" width=\"565\" height=\"194\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s not clear how much this paper was read, but in 1871 Boltzmann (now a professor of mathematical physics in Graz) published another paper entitled simply “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=242%3Bownerid=13510798885806543-250' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Priority of Finding the Relationship between the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Principle of Least Action</a>” that claimed (with some justification) that Clausius’s then-newly-announced virial theorem was already contained in Boltzmann’s 1866 paper.</p>\n<p>But back in 1868—instead of trying to get all the way to Clausius’s entropy—Boltzmann instead uses mechanics to get a generalization of Maxwell’s law for the distribution of molecular velocities. His paper “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=63%3Bownerid=13510798885806543-67' target=_blank rel=noopener>Studies on the Equilibrium of [Kinetic Energy] between [Point Masses] in Motion</a>” opens by saying that while analytical mechanics has in effect successfully studied the evolution of mechanical systems “from a given state to another”, it’s had little to say about what happens when such systems “have been left moving on their own for a long time”. He intends to remedy that, and spends 47 pages—complete with elaborate diagrams and formulas about collisions between hard spheres—in deriving an exponential distribution of energies if one assumes “equilibrium” (or, more specifically, balance between forward and backward processes):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img119.png\" data-url=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=63%3Bownerid=13510798885806543-67\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img119.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s notable that one of the mathematical approaches Boltzmann uses is to discretize (i.e. effectively quantize) things, then look at the &#8220;combinatorial&#8221; limit.  (Based on his later statements, he didn&#8217;t want to trust &#8220;purely continuous&#8221; mathematics—at least in the context of discrete molecular processes—and wanted to explicitly &#8220;watch the limits happening&#8221;.) But in the end it&#8217;s not clear that Boltzmann&#8217;s 1868 arguments do more than the few-line functional-equation approach that Maxwell had already used. (Maxwell would <a href='https://archive.org/details/scientificletter0000maxw/page/914/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>later complain about Boltzmann’s “overly long” arguments</a>.)</p>\n<p>Boltzmann’s 1868 paper had derived what the distribution of molecular energies should be “in equilibrium”. (In 1871 he was talking about “equipartition” not just of kinetic energy, but also of energies associated with “internal motion” of polyatomic molecules.) But what about the approach to equilibrium? How would an initial distribution of molecular energies evolve over time? And would it always end up at the exponential (“Maxwell–Boltzmann”) distribution? These are questions deeply related to a microscopic understanding of the Second Law. And they’re what Boltzmann addressed in 1872 in his 22nd published paper “Further Studies on the Thermal Equilibrium of Gas Molecules”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img120.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/274/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img120.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/276/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>explains that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Maxwell already found the value <em>Av</em><sup>2</sup> <em>e</em><sup>&#8211;<em>Bv</em><sup>2</sup></sup> [for the distribution of velocities] &#8230; so that the probability of different velocities is given by a formula similar to that for the probability of different errors of observation in the theory of the method of least squares. The first proof which Maxwell gave for this formula was recognized to be incorrect even by himself. He later gave a very elegant proof that, if the above distribution has once been established, it will not be changed by collisions. He also tries to prove that it is the only velocity distribution that has this property. But the latter proof appears to me to contain a false inference. It has still not yet been proved that, whatever the initial state of the gas may be, it must always approach the limit found by Maxwell. It is possible that there may be other possible limits. This proof is easily obtained, however, by the method which I am about to explain&#8230; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(He gives a long footnote explaining why Maxwell might be wrong, talking about how a sequence of collisions might lead to a “cycle of velocity states”—which Maxwell hasn’t proved will be traversed with equal probability in each direction. Ironically, this is actually already an analog of where things are going to go wrong with Boltzmann’s own argument.)</p>\n<p>The main idea of Boltzmann’s paper is not to assume equilibrium, but instead to write down an equation (now called the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation' target=_blank rel=noopener>Boltzmann Transport Equation</a>) that explicitly describes how the velocity (or energy) distribution of molecules will change as a result of collisions.

In other words, he is saying that he’s proved that a gas will always (“monotonically”) approach equilibrium—which seems awfully like some kind of microscopic proof of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>But then Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/306/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>makes a bolder claim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">It has thus been rigorously proved that, whatever the initial distribution of kinetic energy may be, in the course of a very long time it must always necessarily approach the one found by Maxwell. The procedure used so far is of course nothing more than a mathematical artifice employed in order to give a rigorous proof of a theorem whose exact proof has not previously been found. It gains meaning by its applicability to the theory of polyatomic gas molecules. There one can again prove that a certain quantity <em>E</em> can only decrease as a consequence of molecular motion, or in a limiting case can remain constant. One can also prove that for the atomic motion of a system of arbitrarily many material points there always exists a certain quantity which, in consequence of any atomic motion, cannot increase, and this quantity agrees up to a constant factor with the value found for the well-known integral ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> in my [1871] paper on the “Analytical proof of the 2nd law, etc.”. We have therefore prepared the way for an analytical proof of the Second Law in a completely different way from those previously investigated. Up to now the object has been to show that ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> = 0 for reversible cyclic processes, but it has not been proved analytically that this quantity is always negative for irreversible processes, which are the only ones that occur in nature. The reversible cyclic process is only an ideal, which one can more or less closely approach but never completely attain. Here, however, we have succeeded in showing that ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> is in general negative, and is equal to zero only for the limiting case, which is of course the reversible cyclic process (since if one can go through the process in either direction, ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> cannot be negative).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, he’s saying that the quantity <em>H</em> that he’s defined microscopically in terms of velocity distributions can be identified (up to a sign) with the entropy that Clausius defined as <em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em>. He says that he’ll show this in the context of analyzing the mechanics of polyatomic molecules. </p>\n<p>But first he’s going to take a break and show that his derivation doesn’t need to assume continuity. In a pre-quantum-mechanics pre-cellular-automaton-fluid kind of way he replaces all the integrals by limits of sums of discrete quantities (i.e. he’s quantizing kinetic energy, etc.):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img126.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/308/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img126.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He says that this discrete approach makes everything clearer, and quotes Lagrange’s derivation of vibrations of a string as an example of where this has happened before. But then he argues that everything works out fine with the discrete approach, and that <em>H</em> still decreases, with the Maxwell distribution as the only possible end point. As an aside, he makes a jab at Maxwell’s derivation, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/306/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>pointing out that</a> with Maxwell’s functional equation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; there are infinitely many other solutions, which are not useful however since &fnof;(<em>x</em>) comes out negative or imaginary for some values of <em>x</em>. Hence, it follows very clearly that Maxwell’s attempt to prove <em>a priori</em> that his solution is the only one must fail, since it is not the only one but rather it is the only one that gives purely positive probabilities, and therefore the only useful one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But finally—after another aside about computing thermal conductivities of gases—Boltzmann digs into polyatomic molecules, and his claim about <em>H</em> being related to entropy. There’s another 26 pages of calculations, and then we get to a section entitled “Solution of Equation (81) and Calculation of Entropy”. More pages of calculation about polyatomic molecules ensue. But finally we’re computing <em>H</em>, and, yes, it agrees with the Clausius result—but anticlimactically he’s only dealing with the case of equilibrium for monatomic molecules, where we already knew we got the Maxwell distribution:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img128.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/366/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img128.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And now he decides he’s not talking about polyatomic molecules anymore, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/368/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>and instead</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In order to find the relation of the quantity [<em>H</em>] to the second law of thermodynamics in the form ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em> < 0, we shall interpret the\nsystem of mass points not, as previously, as a gas molecule, but rather as an entire body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then, in the last couple of pages of his paper, Boltzmann pulls out another idea. He’s discussed the concept that polyatomic molecules (or, now, whole systems) can be in many different configurations, or “phases”. But now he says: “We shall replace [our] single system by a large number of equivalent systems distributed over many different phases, but which do not interact with each other”. In other words, he’s introducing the idea of an ensemble of states of a system. And now he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/368\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a> instead of looking at the distribution just for a single velocity, we should do it for all velocities, i.e. for the whole “phase” of the system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">[These distributions] may be discontinuous, so that they have large values when the variables are very close to certain values determined by one or more equations, and otherwise vanishingly small. We may choose these equations to be those that characterize visible external motion of the body and the kinetic energy contained in it. In this connection it should be noted that the kinetic energy of visible motion corresponds to such a large deviation from the final equilibrium distribution of kinetic energy<br />\nthat it leads to an infinity in <em>H</em>, so that from the point of view of the Second Law of thermodynamics it acts like heat supplied from an infinite temperature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a bunch of ideas swirling around here. Phase-space density (<em>cf</em>. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Liouville&#8217;s equation</a>). Coarse-grained variables. Microscopic representation of mechanical work. Etc. But the paper is ending. There’s a discussion about <em>H</em> for systems that interact, and how there’s an equilibrium value achieved. And finally there’s a formula for entropy</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img129.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sitzungsbericht65unkngoog/page/370/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img129.png\" width='500' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>that Boltzmann said “agrees &#8230; with the expression I found in my previous [1871] paper”. </p>\n<p>So what exactly did Boltzmann really do in his 1872 paper? He introduced the Boltzmann Transport Equation which allows one to compute at least certain non-equilibrium properties of gases. But is his &fnof; log &fnof; quantity really what we can call “entropy” in the sense Clausius meant? And is it true that he’s proved that entropy (even in his sense) increases? A century and a half later there’s still a remarkable level of confusion around both these issues. </p>\n<p>But in any case, back in 1872 Boltzmann’s “minimum theorem” (now called his “<em>H</em> theorem”) created quite a stir. But after some time there was an objection raised, which we’ll discuss below. And partly in response to this, Boltzmann (after spending time working on microscopic models of electrical properties of materials—as well as doing some actual experiments) wrote another major paper on entropy and the Second Law in 1877:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img130.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA373&#038;lpg=PA373#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img130.png\" width='494' height='197' /></a></p>\n<p>The translated title of the paper is “On the Relation between the Second Law of Thermodynamics and Probability Theory with Respect to the Laws of Thermal Equilibrium”. And at the very beginning of the paper Boltzmann makes a statement that was pivotal for future discussions of the Second Law: he says it’s now clear to him that an “analytical proof” of the Second Law is “only possible on the basis of probability calculations”. Now that we know about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-core-phenomenon-of-the-second-law'>computational irreducibility and its implications</a> one could say that this was the point where Boltzmann and those who followed him went off track in understanding the true foundations of the Second Law.

(Note that Boltzmann’s Ω isn’t the modern total-number-of-states Ω; confusingly, that’s essentially the exponential of Boltzmann’s Ω.)</p>\n<p>He goes through some discussion of how to handle extra degrees of freedom in polyatomic molecules, but then he’s on to the main event: arguing that Ω is (essentially) the entropy. It doesn’t take long:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img143.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA427\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img143.png\" width=\"494\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Basically he just says that in equilibrium the probability &fnof;(&#8230;) for a molecule to have a particular velocity is given by the Maxwell distribution, then he substitutes this into the formula for Ω, and shows that indeed, up to a constant, Ω is exactly the “Clausius entropy” ∫<em>dQ</em>/<em>T</em>.</p>\n<p>So, yes, in equilibrium Ω seems to be giving the entropy. But then Boltzmann makes a bit of a jump. He <a href=\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=P429\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a> in processes that aren’t reversible both “Clausius entropy” and Ω will increase, and can still be identified—and enunciates the general principle, printed in his paper in special doubled-spaced form:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img144.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA430\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img144.png\" width=\"494\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; [In] any system of bodies that undergoes state changes &#8230; even if the initial and final states are not in thermal equilibrium &#8230; the total permutability measure for the bodies will continually increase during the state changes, and can remain constant only so long as all the bodies during the state changes remain infinitely close to thermal equilibrium (reversible state changes).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, he’s asserting that Ω behaves the same way entropy is said to behave according to the Second Law. He gives various thought experiments about gases in boxes with dividers, gases under gravity, etc. And finally concludes that, yes, the relationship of entropy to Ω “applies to the general case”. </p>\n<p>There’s one <a href=\"https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=MWXNAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=P434\" target=_blank rel=noopener>final paragraph</a> in the paper, though:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Up to this point, these propositions may be demonstrated exactly using the theory of gases. If one tries, however, to generalize to liquid drops and solid bodies, one must dispense with an exact treatment from the outset, since far too little is known about the nature of the latter states of matter, and the mathematical theory is barely developed. But I have already mentioned reasons in previous papers, in virtue of which it is likely that for these two aggregate states, the thermal equilibrium is achieved when Ω becomes a maximum, and that when thermal equilibrium exists, the entropy is given by the same expression. It can therefore be described as likely that the validity of the principle which I have developed is not just limited to gases, but that the same constitutes a general natural law applicable to solid bodies and liquid droplets, although the exact mathematical treatment of these cases still seems to encounter extraordinary difficulties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, Boltzmann is only saying that it’s “likely” that in thermal equilibrium his permutability measure agrees with Clausius’s entropy, and he’s implying that actually that’s really the only place where Clausius’s entropy is properly defined. But certainly his definition is more general (after all, it doesn’t refer to things like temperature that are only properly defined in equilibrium), and so—even though Boltzmann didn’t explicitly say it—one can imagine basically just using it as the definition of entropy for arbitrary cases.

And this was an idea that Boltzmann seems to have had—with increasing clarity—from the time of his very first paper in 1866 that purported to “prove the Second Law” from mechanics. </p>\n<p>In modern times—with our understanding of discrete systems and computational rules—it’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ergodicity-and-global-behavior'>not difficult to describe the idea of &#8220;visiting all states&#8221;</a>. But in Boltzmann’s time it was considerably more complicated. Did one expect to hit all the infinite possible infinitesimally separated configurations of a system? Or somehow just get close? The fact is that Boltzmann had certainly dipped his toe into thinking about things in terms of discrete quantities. But he didn’t make the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>jump to imagining discrete rules</a>, even though he certainly did know about discrete iterative processes, like Newton’s method for finding roots.</p>\n<p>Boltzmann knew about cases—like circular motion—where everything was purely periodic. But maybe when motion wasn&#8217;t periodic, it&#8217;d inevitably &#8220;visit all states&#8221;. Already in 1868 Boltzmann was writing a paper entitled &#8220;<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337047?urlappend=%3Bseq=111%3Bownerid=13510798885803641-117' target=_blank rel=noopener>Solution to a Mechanical Problem</a>&#8221; where he studies a single point mass moving in an α/<em>r </em>&#8211; β/<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> potential and bouncing elastically off a line—and manages to show that it visits every position with equal probability.

Boltzmann used the same potential again, but now with a name for the “visit-all-states” property: isodic. Meanwhile, Boltzmann had introduced the name “ergoden” for the collection of all possible configurations of a system with a given energy (what would now be called the microcanonical ensemble). But somehow, quite a few years later, Boltzmann’s student <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Paul Ehrenfest</a> (1880–1933) (along with <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Tatiana Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa</a> (1876–1964)) would introduce the term “ergodic” for Boltzmann’s isodic. And “ergodic” is the term that caught on. And in the twentieth century there was all sorts of development of “ergodic theory”, as we’ll discuss a bit later.</p>\n<p>But back in the 1800s people continued to discuss the possibility that what would become called ergodicity was somehow generic, and would explain why all states would somehow be equally probable, why the Maxwell distribution of velocities would be obtained, and ultimately why the Second Law was true. Maxwell worked out some examples. <a href='https://archive.org/details/philtrans00187939/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>So did Kelvin</a>. But it remained unclear how it would all work out, as Kelvin (now with many letters after his name) discussed in a talk he gave in 1900 celebrating the new century:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img150.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/londonedinburgh621901lond/page/n11/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img150.png\" width='516' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The dynamical theory of light didn’t work out.

One skeptic was Boltzmann’s friend and former teacher, the chemist <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Josef+Loschmidt'>Josef Loschmidt</a> (1821–1895), who in 1866 had used kinetic theory to (rather accurately) estimate the size of air molecules.

The underlying molecular equations of motion that Boltzmann had assumed in his proof were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-2--the-notion-of-reversibility'>reversible in time</a>. Yet Boltzmann claimed that <em>H</em> was always going to a minimum. But why couldn’t one use Loschmidt’s argument to construct an equally possible “reverse evolution” in which <em>H</em> was instead going to a maximum?</p>\n<p>It didn’t take Boltzmann long to answer, in print, tucked away in a section of his paper “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012336965?urlappend=%3Bseq=126%3Bownerid=13510798885803827-128' target=_blank rel=noopener>Remarks on Some Problems in the Mechanical Theory of Heat</a>”. He admits that Loschmidt’s argument “has great seductiveness”. But he claims it is merely “an interesting sophism”—and then says he will “locate the source of the fallacy”.

Now he imagines (following Loschmidt) reversing all the velocities in this state at time <em>t</em>. Then, he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=134\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; the spheres would sort themselves out as time progresses, and at [the analog of] time 0, they would have a completely nonuniform distribution, even though the [new] initial distribution [one had used] was almost uniform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But now he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=134\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a>, yes—given this counterexample—it won’t be possible to prove that the final distribution of spheres will always be uniform.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">This is in fact a consequence of probability theory, for any nonuniform distribution, no matter how improbable it may be, is still not absolutely impossible. Indeed it is clear that any individual uniform distribution, which might arise after a certain time from some particular initial state, is just as improbable as an individual nonuniform distribution; just as in the game of Lotto, any individual set of five numbers is as improbable as the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It is only because there are many more uniform distributions than nonuniform ones that the distribution of states will become uniform in the course of time. One therefore cannot prove that, whatever may be the positions and velocities of the spheres at the beginning, the distribution must become uniform after a long time; rather one can only prove that infinitely many more initial states will lead to a uniform one after a definite length of time than to a nonuniform one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=135\" target=_blank rel=noopener>adds</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">One could even calculate, from the relative numbers of the different state distributions, their probabilities, which might lead to an interesting method for the calculation of thermal equilibrium.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And indeed within a few months Boltzmann has followed up on that “interesting method” to produce his classic paper on the probabilistic interpretation of entropy.</p>\n<p>But in his earlier paper he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp \\\n.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=135\" target=_blank rel=noopener>goes on to argue</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Since there are infinitely many more uniform than nonuniform distributions of states, the latter case is extraordinarily improbable [to arise] and can be considered impossible for practical purposes; just as it may be considered impossible that if one starts with oxygen and nitrogen mixed in a container, after a month one will find chemically pure oxygen in the lower half and nitrogen in the upper half, although according to probability theory this is merely very improbable but not impossible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He talks about how interesting it is that the Second Law is intimately connected with probability while the First Law is not. But at the end he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012336965&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=136\" target=_blank rel=noopener>does admit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Perhaps this reduction of the Second Law to the realm of probability makes its application to the entire universe appear dubious, but the laws of probability theory are confirmed by all experiments carried out in the laboratory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point it’s all rather unconvincing. The <em>H</em> theorem had purported to prove the Second Law. But now he’s just talking about probability theory. He seems to have given up on proving the Second Law. And he’s basically just saying that the Second Law is true because it’s observed to be true—like other laws of nature, but not like something that can be “proved”, say from underlying molecular dynamics.</p>\n<p>For many years not much attention was paid to these issues, but by the late 1880s there were <a href='https://archive.org/details/londonedinburgh5301890lon/page/94/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>attempts to clarify things</a>, particularly among the rather active British circle of kinetic theorists.

In essence what it’s saying is that, yes, the Second Law implies that the universe will end up in thermal equilibrium. But there’ll always be fluctuations. And in a big enough universe there’ll be fluctuations somewhere that are large enough to correspond to the world as we experience it, where “visible motion and life exist”.</p>\n<p>But regardless of such claims, there’s a purely formal question about the <em>H</em> theorem. How exactly is it that from the Boltzmann transport equation—which is supposed to describe reversible mechanical processes—the <em>H</em> theorem manages to prove that the <em>H</em> function irreversibly decreases? It wasn’t until 1895—fully 25 years after Boltzmann first claimed to prove the <em>H</em> theorem—that this issue was even addressed. And it first came up rather circuitously through Boltzmann’s response to comments in a textbook by <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kirchhoff/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Gustav Kirchhoff</a> (1824–1887) that had been completed by Max Planck. </p>\n<p>The key point is that Boltzmann’s equation makes an implicit assumption, that’s essentially the same as Maxwell made back in 1860: that before each collision between molecules, the molecules are statistically uncorrelated, so that the probability for the collision has the factored form &fnof;(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>) &fnof;(<em>v</em><sub>2</sub>). But what about after the collision? Inevitably the collision itself will lead to correlations. So now there’s an asymmetry: there are no correlations before each collision, but there are correlations after. And that’s why the behavior of the system doesn’t have to be symmetrical—and the <em>H</em> theorem can prove that <em>H</em> irreversibly decreases.</p>\n<p>In 1895 Boltzmann wrote a 3-page paper (after half in footnotes) entitled “<a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012337138?urlappend=%3Bseq=552%3Bownerid=13510798885807058-554' target=_blank rel=noopener>More about Maxwell&#8217;s Distribution Law for Speeds</a>” where he explained what he thought was going on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">[The reversibility of the laws of mechanics] has been recently applied in judging the assumptions necessary for a proof of [the <em>H</em> theorem]. This proof requires the hypothesis that the state of the gas is and remains molecularly disordered, namely, that the molecules of a given class do not always or predominantly collide in a specific manner and that, on the contrary, the number of collisions of a given kind can be found by the laws of probability.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Now, if we assume that in general a state distribution never remains molecularly ordered for an unlimited time and also that for a stationary state-distribution every velocity is as probable as the reversed velocity, then it follows that by inversion of all the velocities after an infinitely long time every stationary state-distribution remains unchanged. After the reversal, however, there are exactly as many collisions occurring in the reversed way as there were collisions occurring in the direct way. Since the two state distributions are identical, the probability of direct and indirect collisions must be equal for each of them, whence follows Maxwell’s distribution of velocities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann is introducing what we’d now call the “molecular chaos” assumption (and what Ehrenfest would call the <em>Stosszahlansatz</em>)—giving a rather self-fulfilling argument for why the assumption should be true. In Boltzmann’s time there wasn’t really anything better to do. By the 1940s the BBGKY hierarchy at least let one organize the hierarchy of correlations between molecules—though it still didn’t give one a tractable way to assess what correlations should exist in practice, and what not.</p>\n<p>Boltzmann knew these were all complicated issues. But he wrote about them at a technical level only a few more times in his life. The last time was in 1898 when, responding to a request from the mathematician <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Klein/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Felix Klein</a> (1849–1925), he wrote a paper about the <em>H</em> curve for mathematicians. He begins by saying that although this curve comes from the theory of gases, the essence of it can be reproduced by a process based on accumulating balls randomly picked from an urn. He then goes on to outline what amounts to a story of random walks and fractals. In another paper, he actually sketches the curve</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img167.png\" data-url=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012337138&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=605\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img167.png\" width='464' height='210' /></a></p>\n<p>saying that his drawing “should be taken with a large grain of salt”, noting—in a remarkably fractal-reminiscent way—that “a zincographer [i.e. an engraver of printing plates] would not have been able to produce a real figure since the <em>H</em>-curve has a very large number of maxima and minima on each finite segment, and hence defies representation as a line of continuously changing direction.”</p>\n<p>Of course, in modern times it’s easy to produce an approximation to the <em>H</em> curve according to his prescription:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img168_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img168.png\" alt='' title='' width='595' height='57'> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>But at the end of his “mathematical” paper he comes back to talking about gases. And first he makes the claim that the effective reversibility seen in the <em>H</em> curve will never be seen in actual physical systems because, in essence, there are always perturbations from outside. But then he <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp\\.39015012337138&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=657\" target=_blank rel=noopener>ends</a>, in a statement of ultimate reversibility that casts our everyday observation of irreversibility as tautological:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">There is no doubt that it is just as conceivable to have a world in which all natural processes take place in the wrong chronological order. But a person living in this upside-down world would have feelings no different than we do: they would just describe what we call the future as the past and vice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--Section 10 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='the-recurrence-objection'>The Recurrence Objection</h2>\n<p>Probably the single most prominent research topic in mathematical physics in the 1800s was the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/08/when-exactly-will-the-eclipse-happen-a-multimillenium-tale-of-computation/#the-three-body-problem'>three-body problem</a>—of solving for the motion under gravity of three bodies, such as the Earth, Moon and Sun. And in 1890 the French mathematician <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Poincare/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Henri Poincaré</a> (1854–1912) (whose breakout <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-4--three-body-problem/'>work had been on the three-body problem</a>) wrote a paper entitled “On the Three-Body Problem and the Equations of Dynamics” in which, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/actamathematica07lefgoog/page/n18/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>as he said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">It is proved that there are infinitely many ways of choosing the initial conditions such that the system will return infinitely many times as close as one wishes to its initial position. There are also an infinite number of solutions that do not have this property, but it is shown that these unstable solutions can be regarded as “exceptional” and may be said to have zero probability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a mathematical result. But three years later Poincaré <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/revuedemtaphys01pariuoft/page/148/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote what amounted to</a> a philosophy paper entitled “Mechanism and Experience” which expounded on its significance for the Second Law:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In the mechanistic hypothesis, all phenomena must be reversible; for example, the stars might traverse their orbits in the retrograde sense without violating Newton’s law; this would be true for any law of attraction whatever. This is therefore not a fact peculiar to astronomy; reversibility is a necessary consequence of all mechanistic hypotheses.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Experience provides on the contrary a number of irreversible phenomena. For example, if one puts together a warm and a cold body, the former will give up its heat to the latter; the opposite phenomenon never occurs. Not only will the cold body not return to the warm one the heat which it has taken away when it is in direct contact with it; no matter what artifice one may employ, using other intervening bodies, this restitution will be impossible, at least unless the gain thereby realized is compensated by an equivalent or large loss. In other words, if a system of bodies can pass from state A to state B by a certain path, it cannot return from B to A, either by the same path or by a different one. It is this circumstance that one describes by saying that not only is there not direct reversibility, but also there is not even indirect reversibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/revuedemtaphys01pariuoft/page/536/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">A theorem, easy to prove, tells us that a bounded world, governed only by the laws of mechanics, will always pass through a state very close to its initial state. On the other hand, according to accepted experimental laws (if one attributes absolute validity to them, and if one is willing to press their consequences to the extreme), the universe tends toward a certain final state, from which it will never depart. In this final state, which will be a kind of death, all bodies will be at rest at the same temperature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But in fact, he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/revuedemtaphys01pariuoft/page/536/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says</a>, the recurrence theorem shows that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">This state will not be the final death of the universe, but a sort of slumber, from which it will awake after millions of millions of centuries. According to this theory, to see heat pass from a cold body to a warm one &#8230; it will suffice to have a little patience. [And we may] hope that some day the telescope will show us a world in the process of waking up, where the laws of thermodynamics are reversed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By 1903, Poincaré was more strident in his critique of the formalism around the Second Law, writing (in English) in a paper entitled “On Entropy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img169.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/uvresdehenripoin10poin/page/269/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img169.png\" width='602' height='396' /></a></p>\n<p>But back in 1896, Boltzmann and the <em>H</em> theorem had another critic: <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Zermelo/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ernst Zermelo</a> (1871–1953), a recent German math PhD who was then working with Max Planck on applied mathematics—though would soon turn to foundations of mathematics and become the “Z” in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC set theory</a>. Zermelo’s attack on the <em>H</em> theorem began with a paper entitled “<a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1896_57_3/page/484/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>On a Theorem of Dynamics and the Mechanical Theory of Heat</a>”. After explaining Poincaré’s recurrence theorem, Zermelo gives some “mathematician-style” conditions (the gas must be in a finite region, must have no infinite energies, etc.), then says that even though there must exist states that would be non-recurrent and could show irreversible behavior, there would necessarily be infinitely more states that “would periodically repeat themselves &#8230; with arbitrarily small variations”. And, he argues, such repetition would affect macroscopic quantities discernable by our senses. He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\\nn247/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In order to retain the general validity of the Second Law, we therefore would have to assume that just those initial states leading to irreversible processes are realized in nature, their small number notwithstanding, while the other ones, whose probability of existence is higher, mathematically speaking, do not actually occur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n251/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>concludes</a> that the Poincaré recurrence phenomenon means that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; it is certainly impossible to carry out a mechanical derivation of the Second Law on the basis of the existing theory without specializing the initial states.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n251/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>responded promptly</a> but quite impatiently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I have pointed out particularly often, and as clearly as I possibly could &#8230; that the Second Law is but a principle of probability theory as far as the molecular-theoretic point of view is concerned. &#8230; While the theorem by Poincaré that Zermelo discusses in the beginning of his paper is of course correct, its application to heat theory is not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n253/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>talks about</a> the <em>H</em> curve, and first makes rather a mathematician-style point about the order of limits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">If we first take the number of gas molecules to be infinite, as was clearly done in [my 1896 proof], and only then let the time grow very large, then, in the vast majority of cases, we obtain a curve asymptotically [always close to zero]. Moreover, as can easily be seen, Poincaré’s theorem is not applicable in this case. If, however, we take the time [span] to be infinitely great and, in contrast, the number of molecules to be very great but not absolutely infinite, then the <em>H</em>-curve has a different character. It almost always runs very close to [zero], but in rare cases it rises above that, in what we shall call a “hump” &#8230; at which significant deviations from the Maxwell velocity distribution can occur &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann then <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n255/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>argues that</a> even if you start “at a hump”, you won’t stay there, and “over an enormously long period of time” you’ll see something infinitely close to “equilibrium behavior”. But, he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; it is [always] possible to reach again a greater hump of the <em>H</em>-curve by further extending the time &#8230; In fact, it is even the case that the original state must return, provided only that we continue to sufficiently extend the time&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n255/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Mr. Zermelo is therefore right in claiming that, mathematically speaking, the motion is periodic. He has by no means succeeded, however, in refuting my theorems, which, in fact, are entirely consistent with this periodicity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After giving arguments about the probabilistic character of his results, and (as we would now say it) the fact that a 1D random walk is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/#are-they-like-random-walks'>certain to repeatedly return to the origin</a>, Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n257/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>says that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; we must not conclude that the mechanical approach has to be modified in any way. This conclusion would be justified only if the approach had a consequence that runs contrary to experience. But this would be the case only if Mr. Zermelo were able to prove that the duration of the period within which the old state of the gas must recur in accordance with Poincaré’s theorem has an observable length&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to imagine “a trillion tiny spheres, each with a [certain initial velocity] &#8230; in the one corner of a box” (and by “trillion” he means million million million, or today’s quintillion) and then says that “after a short time the spheres will be distributed fairly evenly in the box”, but the period for a “Poincaré recurrence” in which they all will return to their original corner is “so great that nobody can live to see it happen”. And to make this point more forcefully, Boltzmann has an appendix in which he tries to get an actual approximation to the recurrence time, concluding that its numerical value “has many trillions of digits”. </p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n261/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>concludes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">If we consider heat as a motion of molecules that occurs in accordance with the general equations of mechanics and assume that the arrangement of bodies that we perceive is currently in a highly improbable state, then a theorem follows that is in agreement with the Second Law for all phenomena so far observed.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Of course, this theorem can no longer hold once we observe bodies of so small a scale that they only contain a few molecules.

In fact, certain experiments conducted on very small bodies in gases seem rather to support the assumption, although we are still far from being able to assert its correctness on the basis of experimental proof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n263/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>gives an important caveat</a>—with a small philosophical flourish:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Of course, we cannot expect natural science to answer the question as to why the bodies surrounding us currently exist in a highly improbable state, just as we cannot expect it to answer the question as to why there are any phenomena at all and why they adhere to certain given principles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly—particularly in view of his future efforts in the foundations of mathematics—Zermelo is unconvinced by all of this. And six months later he replies again in print. He admits that a full Poincaré recurrence might take astronomically long, but <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n271/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>notes that</a> (where, by “physical state”, he means one that we perceive):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; we are after all always concerned only with the &#8220;physical state&#8221;, which can be realized by many different combinations, and hence can recur much sooner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zermelo zeroes in on many of the weaknesses in Boltzmann’s arguments, saying that the thing he particularly “contests &#8230; is the analogy that is supposed to exist between the properties of the <em>H</em> curve and the Second Law”. He claims that irreversibility cannot be explained from “mechanical suppositions” without “new physical assumptions”—and in particular <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#why-the-second-law-works'>criteria for choosing appropriate initial states</a>. He <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\\nn279/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>ends by saying that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">From the great successes of the kinetic theory of gases in explaining the relationships among states we must not deduce its &#8230; applicability also to temporal processes. &#8230; [For in this case I am] convinced that it necessarily fails in the absence of entirely new assumptions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boltzmann replies again—<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n281/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>starting off</a> with the strangely weak argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The Second Law receives a mechanical explanation by virtue of the assumption, which is of course unprovable, that the universe, when considered as a mechanical system, or at least a very extensive part thereof surrounding us, started out in a highly improbable state and still is in such a state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, yes, there’s clearly something missing in the understanding of the Second Law. And even as Zermelo pushes for formal mathematician-style clarity, Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\\nn283/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>responds</a> with physicist-style “reasonable arguments”. There’s lots of rhetoric:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The applicability of the calculus of probabilities to a particular case can of course never be proved with precision. If 100 out of 100,000 objects of a particular sort are consumed by fire per year, then we cannot infer with certainty that this will also be the case next year. On the contrary! If the same conditions continue to obtain for 10<sup>10</sup> years, then it will often be the case during this period that the 100,000 objects are all consumed by fire at once on a single day, and even that not a single object suffers damage over the course of an entire year. Nevertheless, every insurance company places its faith in the calculus of probabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n287/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>in justification of the idea</a> that we live in a highly improbable “low-entropy” part of the universe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I refuse to grant the objection that a mental picture requiring so great a number of dead parts of the universe for the explanation of so small a number of animated parts is wasteful, and hence inexpedient. I still vividly remember someone who adamantly refused to believe that the Sun’s distance from the Earth is 20 million miles on the ground that it would simply be foolish to assume so vast a space only containing luminiferous aether alongside so small a space filled with life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Curiously—given his apparent reliance on “commonsense” arguments—Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n285/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>also says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I myself have repeatedly cautioned against placing excessive trust in the extension of our mental pictures beyond experience and issued reminders that the pictures of contemporary mechanics, and in particular the conception of the smallest particles of bodies as material points, will turn out to be provisional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, we don’t know that we can think of atoms (even if they exist at all) as points, and we can’t really expect our everyday intuition to tell us about how they work. Which presumably means that we need some kind of solid, “formal” argument if we’re going to explain the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Zermelo didn’t respond again, and moved on to other topics. But Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-540-70856-8/page/\\n291/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>wrote one more paper</a> in 1897 about “A Mechanical Theorem of Poincaré” ending with two more why-it-doesn’t-apply-in-practice arguments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Poincaré’s theorem is of course never applicable to terrestrial bodies which we can hold in our hands as none of them is entirely closed. Nor it is applicable to an entirely closed gas of the sort considered by the kinetic theory if first the number of molecules and only then the quotients of the intervals between two neighboring collisions in the observation time is allowed to become infinite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--Section 11 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='ensembles,-and-an-effort-to-make-things-rigorous'>Ensembles, and an Effort to Make Things Rigorous</h2>\n<p>Boltzmann—and Maxwell before him—had introduced the idea of using probability theory to discuss the emergence of thermodynamics and potentially the Second Law. But it wasn’t until around 1900—with the work of <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gibbs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>J. Willard Gibbs</a> (1839–1903)—that a principled mathematical framework for thinking about this developed. And while <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#why-the-second-law-works'>we can now see</a> that this framework distracts in some ways from several of the key issues in understanding the foundations of the Second Law, it’s been important in framing the discussion of what the Second Law really says—as well as being central in defining the foundations for much of what’s been done over the past century or so under the banner of “statistical mechanics”. </p>\n<p>Gibbs seems to have first gotten involved with thermodynamics around 1870. He’d finished his PhD at Yale on <a href='https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/16662400' target=_blank rel=noopener>the geometry of gears</a> in 1863—getting the first engineering PhD awarded in the US. After traveling in Europe and interacting with various leading mathematicians and physicists, he came back to Yale (where he stayed for the remaining 34 years of his life) and in 1871 became professor of mathematical physics there. </p>\n<p>His first papers (published in 1873 when he was already 34 years old) were in a sense based on taking seriously the formalism of equilibrium thermodynamics defined by Clausius and Maxwell—treating entropy and internal energy, just like pressure, volume and temperature, as variables that defined properties of materials (and notably whether they were solids, liquids or gases). Gibbs’s main idea was to “geometrize” this setup, and make it essentially a story of multivariate calculus:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img171.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactions02conn/page/n359/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img171.png\" width='620' height='515' /></a></p>\n<p>Unlike the European developers of thermodynamics, Gibbs didn’t interact deeply with other scientists—with the possible exception of Maxwell, who (a few years before his death in 1879) made a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_thermodynamic_surface' target=_blank rel=noopener>3D version of Gibbs&#8217;s thermodynamic surface out of clay</a>—and supplemented his 2D thermodynamic diagrams <a href='https://archive.org/details/theoryheat03maxwgoog/page/n5/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>after the first edition of his textbook <em>Theory of Heat</em></a> with renderings of 3D versions:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img172.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/theoryheat03maxwgoog/page/n5/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img172.png\" width='507' height='399' /></a></p>\n<p>Three years later, Gibbs began publishing what would be a 300-page work defining what has become the standard formalism for equilibrium chemical thermodynamics. He began with a quote from Clausius:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory11922img55.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/transactions03conn/page/108/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory11922img55.png\" width='594' height='399' /></a></p>\n<p>In the years that followed, <a href='https://www.eng.uc.edu/~beaucag/Classes/AdvancedMaterialsThermodynamics/Books/Gibbs%20G.W.%20-%20Collected%20works.%20Thermodynamics.%20Volume%201-Longmans%20(1928).pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>Gibbs’s work</a>—stimulated by Maxwell—mostly concentrated on electrodynamics, and later quaternions and vector analysis. But Gibbs published a few more small papers on thermodynamics—always in effect taking equilibrium (and the Second Law) for granted. </p>\n<p>In 1882—a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Turner_Eddy' target=_blank rel=noopener>Henry Eddy</a> (1844–1921) (who in 1879 had written a <a href='https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnyjps&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=10' target=_blank rel=noopener>book on thermodynamics</a>, and in 1890 would become president of the University of Cincinnati), claimed that “radiant heat” could be used to violate the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img174.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofamep20amer/page/334/mode/2\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img174.png\" width='620' height='310' /></a></p>\n<p>Gibbs soon published a 2-page rebuttal (in the <a href='https://www.science.org/toc/science/ns-1/6' target=_blank rel=noopener>6th-ever issue of <em>Science</em> magazine</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img175.png\" data-url=\" https://archive.org/details/scientificpaper00gibbgoog/page/n439/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img175.png\" width='300' height='214' /></a></p>\n<p>Then in 1889 Clausius died, and Gibbs wrote an obituary—praising Clausius but making it clear he didn’t think the kinetic theory of gases was a solved problem:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img176.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof02gibb/page/n17/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img176.png\" alt='' title='' width='600' height='146' /></a></p>\n<p>That same year Gibbs announced a short course that he would teach at Yale on “The <em>a priori</em> Deduction of Thermodynamic Principles from the Theory of Probabilities”. After a decade of work, this evolved into Gibbs’s last publication—an original and elegant book that’s largely defined how the Second Law has been thought about ever since:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific

begins by explaining that mechanics is about studying the time evolution of single systems:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img178.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n12/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

is going to do something different: he is going to look at what he’ll call an ensemble of systems, and see how the distribution of their characteristics changes over time:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img179.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n12/mode/2up\"><img

explains that these “inquiries” originally arose in connection with deriving the laws of thermodynamics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img180.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

this area—which he’s calling statistical mechanics—is worth investigating even independent of its connection to thermodynamics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img181.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

this effort will be relevant to the foundations of thermodynamics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img182.png\"

src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img182.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"89\" /></a></p>\n<p>He immediately then goes on to what he’ll claim is the way to think about the relation of “observed thermodynamics” to his exact statistical mechanics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img183.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

interesting—if, in the light of history, very overly optimistic—claim that “the laws of thermodynamics may be easily obtained from the principles of statistical mechanics”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img184.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n14/mode/2up\"><img

first the text of the book reads very much like a typical mathematical work on mechanics:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img185.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n26/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy'

“going statistical”, talking about the “density” of systems in “phase” (i.e. with respect to the variables defining the configuration of the system). And a few pages in, he’s proving the fundamental result that the density of “phase fluid” satisfies a continuity equation (which we’d now call the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Liouville equation</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img186.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n34/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img186.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s all quite elegant, and all very rooted in the calculus-based mathematics of its time. He’s thinking about a collection of instances of a system. But while with our modern computational paradigm we’d readily be able to talk about a discrete list of instances, with his calculus-based approach he has to consider a continuous collection of instances—whose treatment inevitably seems more abstract and less explicit.</p>\n<p>He soon makes contact with the “theory of errors”, discussing in effect how probability distributions over the space of possible states evolve. But what probability distributions should one consider? By chapter 4, he’s looking at what he calls (and is still called) the “canonical distribution”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img187.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img187.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He gives a now-classic definition for the probability as a function of energy ϵ:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img188.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img188.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He observes that this distribution combines nicely when independent parts of a system are brought together, and soon he’s noting that:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img189.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n58/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img189.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But so far he’s careful to just talk about how things are “analogous”, without committing to a true connection:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img190.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n70/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img190.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>More than halfway through the book he’s defined certain properties of his probability distributions that “may &#8230; correspond to the thermodynamic notions of entropy and temperature”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img191.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n130/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img191.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"211\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next he’s on to the concept of a “microcanonical ensemble” that includes only states of a given energy. For him—with his continuum-based setup—this is a slightly elaborate thing to define; in our modern computational framework it actually becomes more straightforward than his &#8220;canonical ensemble&#8221;. Or, as he already says:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img192.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n142/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img192.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But what about the Second Law? Now he’s getting a little closer:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img193.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n156/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img193.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"94\" /></a></p>\n<p>When he says “index of probability” he’s talking about the log of a probability in his ensemble, so this result is about the fact that this quantity is extremized when all the elements of the ensemble have equal probability:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img194.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n156/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img194.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Soon he’s discussing whether he can use his index as a way—like Boltzmann tried to do with his version of entropy—to measure deviations from “statistical equilibrium”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img195.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n172/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img195.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But now Gibbs has hit one of the classic gotchas of his approach: if you look in perfect detail at the evolution of an ensemble of systems, there’ll never be a change in the value of his index—essentially because of the overall conservation of probability. Gibbs brings in what amounts to a commonsense physics argument to handle this. He says to consider putting “coloring matter” in a liquid that one stirs. And then he says that even though the liquid (like his phase fluid) is microscopically conserved, the coloring matter will still end up being “uniformly mixed” in the liquid:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img196.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n172/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img196.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He talks about how the conclusion about whether mixing happens in effect depends on what order one takes limits in. And while he doesn’t put it quite this way, he’s essentially realized that there’s a competition between the system “mixing things up more and more finely” and the observer being able to track finer and finer details. He realizes, though, that not all systems will show this kind of mixing behavior, noting for example that there are mechanical systems that’ll just keep going in simple cycles forever. </p>\n<p>He doesn’t really resolve the question of why “practical systems” should show mixing, more or less ending with a statement that even though his underlying mechanical systems are reversible, it’s somehow “in practice” difficult to go back:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img197.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n178/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img197.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite things like this, Gibbs appears to have been keen to keep the majority of his book “purely mathematical”, in effect proving theorems that necessarily followed from the setup he had given. But in the penultimate chapter of the book he makes what he seems to have viewed as a less-than-satisfactory attempt to connect what he’s done with “real thermodynamics”. He doesn’t really commit to the connection, though, characterizing it more as an “analogy”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img198.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n192/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img198.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But he soon starts to be pretty clear that he actually wants to prove the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img199.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n194/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img199.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He quickly backs off a little, in effect bringing in the observer to soften the requirements:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img200.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n194/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img200.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But then he fires his best shot. He says that the quantities he’s defined in connection with his canonical ensemble satisfy the same equations as Clausius originally set up for temperature and entropy:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img201.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n196/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img201.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He adds that fluctuations (or “anomalies”, as he calls them) become imperceptible in the limit of a large system:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img202.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n196/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img202.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But in physical reality, why should one have a whole collection of systems as in the canonical ensemble? Gibbs suggests it would be more natural to look at the microcanonical ensemble—and in fact to look at a “time ensemble”, i.e. an averaging over time rather than an averaging over different possible states of the system:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img203.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n196/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img203.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gibbs has proved some results (e.g. related to the virial theorem) about the relation between time and ensemble averages. But as the future of the subject amply demonstrates, they’re not nearly strong enough to establish any general equivalence. Still, Gibbs presses on.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, as he himself recognized, things weren’t solved—and certainly the canonical ensemble wasn’t the whole story:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img204.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n206/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img204.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>He discusses the tradeoff between having a canonical ensemble “heat bath” of a known temperature, and having a microcanonical ensemble with known energy. At one point he admits that it might be better to consider the time evolution of a single state, but basically decides that—at least in his continuous-probability-distribution-based formalism—he can’t really set this up:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img205.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementaryprinc00gibbgoog/page/n208/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img205.png\" width=\"520\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gibbs definitely encourages the idea that his “statistical mechanics” has successfully “derived” thermodynamics. But he’s ultimately quite careful and circumspect in what he actually says. He mentions the Second Law only once in his whole book—and then only to note that he can get the same “mathematical expression” from his canonical ensemble as Clausius’s form of the Second Law. He doesn’t mention Boltzmann’s <em>H</em> theorem anywhere in the book, and—apart from one footnote concerning “difficulties long recognized by physicists”—he mentions only Boltzmann’s work on theoretical mechanics.</p>\n<p>One can view the main achievement of Gibbs’s book as having been to define a framework in which precise results about the statistical properties of collections of systems could be defined and in some cases derived. Within the mathematics and other formalism of the time, such ensemble results represented in a sense a distinctly “higher-order” description of things. Within our current computational paradigm, though, there’s much less of a distinction to be made: whether one’s looking at a single path of evolution, or a whole collection, one’s ultimately still just dealing with a computation. And that makes it clearer that—ensembles or not—one’s thrown back into the same kinds of issues about the origin of the Second Law. But even so, Gibbs provided a language in which to talk with some clarity about many of the things that come up.</p>\n<p><!--Section 12 Maxwell's Demon--></p>\n<h2 id='maxwell&rsquo;s-demon'>Maxwell&#8217;s Demon</h2>\n<p>In late 1867 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tait/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Peter Tait</a> (1831–1901)—a childhood friend of Maxwell’s who was by then a professor of “natural philosophy” in Edinburgh—was finishing his sixth book. It was entitled <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/sketchofthermody00taitrich/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sketch of Thermodynamics</a></em> and gave a brief, historically oriented and not particularly conceptual outline of what was then known about thermodynamics. He sent a draft to Maxwell, who responded with a fairly long letter:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img206.png\" data-url=\"https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PH-CAVENDISH-P-00092/1\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img206.png\" width='580' height='' /></a></p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/212/mode/2up?view=theater' target=_blank rel=noopener>The letter</a> begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I do not know in a controversial manner the history of thermodynamics &#8230; [and] I could make no assertions about the priority of authors &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Any contributions I could make &#8230; [involve] picking holes here and there to ensure strength and stability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/212/mode/\\2up?view=theater\" target=_blank rel=noopener>he continues</a> (with “ΘΔcs” being his whimsical Greekified rendering of the word “thermodynamics”):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">To pick a hole—say in the 2nd law of ΘΔcs, that if two things are in contact the hotter cannot take heat from the colder without external agency.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Now let A and B be two vessels divided by a diaphragm &#8230; Now conceive a finite being who knows the paths and velocities of all the molecules by simple inspection but who can do no work except open and close a hole in the diaphragm by means of a slide without mass.

Tait must at some point have shown Maxwell’s letter to Kelvin, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/214/mode/\\2up?view=theater\" target=_blank rel=noopener>who wrote on it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Very good.

But Maxwell included one final chapter:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img208.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=10\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img208.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Even in 1871, after all his <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases' target=_blank rel=noopener>work on kinetic theory</a>, Maxwell is quite circumspect in his discussion of molecules:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img209.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=298\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img209.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But Maxwell’s textbook goes through a series of standard kinetic theory results, much as a modern textbook would. The second-to-last section in the whole book sounds a warning, however:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img210.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=321\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img210.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Interestingly, Maxwell continues, somewhat in anticipation of what Gibbs will say 30 years later:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img211.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=322\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img211.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But then there’s a reminder that this is being written in 1871, several decades before any clear observation of molecules was made. Maxwell says:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img212.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=322\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img212.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In other words, if there are water molecules, there must be something other than a law of averages that makes them all appear the same. And, yes, it’s now treated as a fundamental fact of physics that, for example, all electrons have exactly—not just statistically—the same properties such as mass and charge. But back in 1871 it was much less clear what characteristics molecules—if they existed as real entities at all—might have.</p>\n<p>Maxwell included one last section in his book that to us today might seem quite wild:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img213.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=323\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img213.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In other words, aware of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin' target=_blank rel=noopener>Darwin</a>’s (1809–1882) 1859 <em>Origin of Species</em>, he’s considering a kind of “speciation” of molecules, along the lines of the discrete species observed in biology. But then he notes that unlike biological organisms, molecules are “permanent”, so their “selection” must come from some kind of pure separation process:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img214.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=324\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img214.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And at the very end he suggests that if molecules really are all identical, that suggests a level of fundamental order in the world that we might even be able to flow through to “exact principles of distributive justice” (presumably for people rather than molecules):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img215.png\" data-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/J._Clerk_Maxwell._Theory_of_Heat_%281871%29.pdf#page=325\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img215.png\" width='480' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Maxwell has described rather clearly his idea of demons. But the actual name “demon” first appears in print in a paper by Kelvin in 1874:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img216.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_nature-uk_1874-04-09_9_232/page/440/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img216.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>It’s a British paper, so—in a nod to future nanomachinery—it’s talking about (molecular) cricket bats:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img217.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_nature-uk_1874-04-09_9_232/page/442/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img217.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kelvin’s paper—like his note written on Maxwell’s letter—imagines that the demons don’t just “sort” molecules; they actually reverse their velocities, thus in effect anticipating Loschmidt’s 1876 “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#but-what-about-reversibility?' target=_blank rel=noopener>reversibility objection</a>” to Boltzmann’s <em>H</em> theorem.</p>\n<p>In an undated note, Maxwell <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lifescientificwo00knotuoft/page/214/mode/\\2up?view=theater\" target=_blank rel=noopener>discusses demons</a>, attributing the name to Kelvin—and then starts considering the “physicalization” of demons, simplifying what they need to do: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Concerning Demons.<br />\nI. Who gave them this name? Thomson.<br />\n2. What were they by nature?

To show that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics has only a statistical certainty.<br />\n4. Is the production of an inequality of temperature their only occupation? No, for less intelligent demons can produce a difference in pressure as well as temperature by merely allowing all particles going in one direction while stopping all those going the other way. This reduces the demon to a valve. As such value him. Call him no more a demon but a valve like that of the hydraulic ram, suppose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It didn’t take long for Maxwell’s demon to become something of a fixture in expositions of thermodynamics, even if it wasn’t clear how it connected to other things people were saying about thermodynamics. And in 1879, for example, Kelvin gave a talk all about Maxwell’s “sorting demon” (like other British people of the time he referred to Maxwell as “Clerk Maxwell”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img218.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mathematicalphys05kelvuoft/page/20/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img218.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Kelvin describes—without much commentary, and without mentioning the Second Law—some of the feats of which the demon would be capable.

One might think that the observability of Brownian motion would make something like a Maxwell’s demon possible. And indeed in 1912 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Smoluchowski/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Marian Smoluchowski</a> (1872–1917) suggested <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_ratchet' target=_blank rel=noopener>experiments that one could imagine</a> would “systematically harvest” Brownian motion—but showed that in fact they couldn’t. In later years, a sequence of arguments were advanced that the mechanism of a Maxwell’s demon just couldn’t work in practice—though even today microscopic versions of what amount to Maxwell’s demons are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#maxwell&rsquo;s-demon' target=_blank rel=noopener>routinely being investigated</a>.</p>\n<p><!--Timeline section--></p>\n<h2 id='what-happened-to-those-people?'>What Happened to Those People?</h2>\n<p>We’ve finally now come to the end of the story of how the original framework for the Second Law came to be set up.

Clausius, Boltzmann and Gibbs are today celebrated mainly for their contributions to thermodynamics; Kelvin and Maxwell also for other things. Clausius and Gibbs were in a sense “pure professors”; Boltzmann, Maxwell and especially Kelvin also had engagement with the more general public.</p>\n<p>All of them spent the majority of their lives in the countries of their birth—and all (with the exception of Carnot) were able to live out the entirety of their lives without time-consuming disruptions from war or other upheavals:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img222_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img222.png\" alt='' title='' width='541' height=''> </div>\n<p><span></p>\n<h3>Sadi Carnot (1796&ndash;1832)</h3>\n<p>Almost all of what is known about Sadi Carnot as a person comes from a single biographical note written nearly half a century after his death by his younger brother <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Carnot' target=_blank rel=noopener>Hippolyte Carnot</a> (who was a distinguished French politician—and sometime education minister—and father of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadi_Carnot_(statesman)' target=_blank rel=noopener>Sadi Carnot</a> who would become president of France). Hippolyte Carnot <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f86.image\" target=_blank rel=noopener>began by saying that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nAs the life of Sadi Carnot was not marked by any notable event, his biography would have occupied only a few lines; but a scientific work by him, after remaining long in obscurity, brought again to light many years after his death, has caused his name to be placed among those of great inventors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Carnots’ father was close to Napoleon, and Hippolyte explains that when Sadi was a young child he ended up being babysat by “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Jos%C3%A9phine' target=_blank rel=noopener>Madame Bonaparte</a>”—but one day wandered off, and was found inspecting the operation of a nearby mill, and quizzing the miller about it. For the most part, however, throughout his life, Sadi Carnot apparently kept very much to himself—while with quiet intensity showing a great appetite for intellectual pursuits from mathematics and science to art, music and literature, as well as practical engineering and the science of various sports.</p>\n<p>Even his brother Hippolyte can’t explain quite how Sadi Carnot—at the age of 28—suddenly “came out” and in 1824 published his book on thermodynamics. (As we discussed above, it no doubt had something to do with the work of <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Carnot/' target=_blank rel=noopener>his father</a>, who died two years earlier.) Sadi Carnot funded the publication of the book himself—having 600 copies printed (at least some of which remained unsold a decade later). But after the book was published, Carnot appears to have returned to just privately doing research, living alone, and never publishing again in his lifetime. And indeed he lived only another eight years, dying (apparently after some months of ill health) in the same Paris cholera outbreak that claimed <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Maximilien_Lamarque' target=_blank rel=noopener>General Lamarque</a> of <em>Les Misérables</em> fame.</p>\n<p>Twenty-three pages of <a href='https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f96' target=_blank rel=noopener>unpublished personal notes</a> survive from the period after the publication of Carnot’s book. Some are general aphorisms and life principles: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Speak little of what you know, and not at all of what you do not know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Why try to be witty? I would rather be thought stupid and modest than witty and pretentious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">God cannot punish man for not believing when he could so easily have enlightened and convinced him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The belief in an all-powerful Being, who loves us and watches over us, gives to the mind great strength to endure misfortune.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">When walking, carry a book, a notebook to preserve ideas, and a piece of bread in order to prolong the walk if need be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But others are more technical—and in fact reveal that Carnot, despite having based his book on caloric theory, had <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f107\" target=_blank rel=noopener>realized that it probably wasn’t correct</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">When a hypothesis no longer suffices to explain phenomena, it should be abandoned. This is the case with the hypothesis which regards caloric as matter, as a subtile fluid.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The experimental facts tending to destroy this theory are as follows: The development of heat by percussion or friction of bodies &#8230; The elevation of temperature which takes place [when] air [expands into a] vacuum &#8230; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f109\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nAt present, light is generally regarded as the result of a vibratory movement of the ethereal fluid. Light produces heat, or at least accompanies radiating heat, and moves with the same velocity as heat. Radiating heat is then a vibratory movement. It would be ridiculous to suppose that it is an emission of matter while the light which accompanies it could be only a movement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nCould a motion (that of radiating heat) produce matter (caloric)? No, undoubtedly; it can only produce a motion. Heat is then the result of a motion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then—in a rather clear enunciation of <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f111\" target=_blank rel=noopener>what would become</a> the First Law of thermodynamics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nHeat is simply motive power, or rather motion which has changed form. It is a movement among the particles of bodies. Wherever there is destruction of motive power there is, at the same time, production of heat in quantity exactly proportional to the quantity of motive power destroyed. Reciprocally, wherever there is destruction of heat, there is production of motive power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carnot <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1170344j/f110\" target=_blank rel=noopener>also wonders</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nLiquefaction of bodies, solidification of liquids, crystallization—are they not forms of combinations of integrant molecules? Supposing heat due to a vibratory movement, how can the passage from the solid or the liquid to the gaseous state be explained?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no indication of how Carnot felt about this emerging rethinking of thermodynamics, or of how it might affect the results in his book. But Carnot clearly hoped to do experiments (as outlined in his notes) to test what was really going on. But as it was, he presumably didn’t get around to any of them—and his notes, ahead of their time as they were, did not resurface for many decades, by which time the ideas they contained had already been discovered by others.</p>\n<h3>Rudolf Clausius (1822&ndash;1888)</h3>\n<p>Rudolf Clausius was born in what’s now Poland (and was then Prussia), one of more than 14 children of an education administrator and pastor. He went to university in Berlin, and, after considering doing history, eventually specialized in math and physics. After graduating in 1844 he started teaching at a top high school in Berlin (which he did for 6 years), and meanwhile earned his PhD in physics. His career took off after his breakout paper on thermodynamics appeared in 1850. For a while he was a professor in Berlin, then for 12 years in Zürich, then briefly in Würzburg, then—for the remaining 19 years of his life—in Bonn.</p>\n<p>He was a diligent—if, one suspects, somewhat stiff—professor, notable for the clarity of his lectures, and his organizational care with students. He seems to have been a competent administrator, and late in his career he spent a couple of years as the president (“rector”) of his university. But first and foremost, he was a researcher, writing about a hundred papers over the course of his career. Most physicists of the time devoted at least some of their efforts to doing actual physics experiments. But Clausius was a pioneer in the idea of being a “pure theoretical physicist”, inspired by experiments and quoting their results, but not doing them himself. </p>\n<p>The majority of Clausius’s papers were about thermodynamics, though late in his career his emphasis shifted more to electrodynamics. Clausius’s papers were original, clear, incisive and often fairly mathematically sophisticated. But from his very first paper on thermodynamics in 1850, he very much adopted a macroscopic approach, talking about what he considered to be “bulk” quantities like energy, and later entropy. He did explore some of the potential mechanics of molecules, but he never really made the connection between molecular phenomena and entropy—or the Second Law. He had a number of run-ins about academic credit with Kelvin, Tait, Maxwell and Boltzmann, but he didn’t seem to ever pay much attention to, for example, Boltzmann’s efforts to find molecular-based probabilistic derivations of Clausius’s results.</p>\n<p>It probably didn’t help that after two decades of highly productive work, two misfortunes befell Clausius. First, in 1870, he had volunteered to lead an ambulance corps in the Franco-Prussian war, and was wounded in the knee, leading to chronic pain (as well as to his habit of riding to class on horseback). And then, in 1875, Clausius’s wife died in the birth of their sixth child—leaving him to care for six young children (which apparently he did with great conscientiousness). Clausius nevertheless continued to pursue his research—even to the end of his life—receiving many honors along the way (like election to no less than 40 professional societies), but it never again rose to the level of significance of his early work on thermodynamics and the Second Law.</p>\n<h3>Kelvin (William Thomson) (1824&ndash;1907)</h3>\n<p>Of the people we’re discussing here, by far the most famous during their lifetime was Kelvin. In his long career he wrote more than 600 scientific papers, received dozens of patents, started several companies and served in many administrative and governmental roles. His father was a math professor, ultimately in Glasgow, who took a great interest in the education of his children. Kelvin himself got an early start, effectively going to college at the age of 10, and becoming a professor in Glasgow at the age of 22—a position in which he continued for 53 years.</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s breakout work, done in his twenties, was on thermodynamics. But over the years he also worked on many other areas of physics, and beyond, mixing theory, experiment and engineering. Beginning in 1854 he became involved in a technical megaproject of the time: the attempt to lay a transatlantic telegraph cable. He wound up very much on the front lines, helping out as a just-in-time physicist + engineer on the cable-laying ship. The first few attempts didn’t work out, but finally in 1866—in no small part through Kelvin’s contributions—a cable was successfully laid, and Kelvin (or William Thomson, as he then was) became something of a celebrity. He was made “Sir William Thomson” and—along with two other techies—formed his first company, which had considerable success in exploiting telegraph-cable-related engineering innovations.</p>\n<p>Kelvin’s first wife died after a long illness in 1870, and Kelvin, with no children and already enthusiastic about the sea, bought a fairly large yacht, and pursued a number of nautical-related projects. One of these—begun in 1872—was the construction of an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide-predicting_machine' target=_blank rel=noopener>analog computer for calculating tides</a> (basically with 10 gears for adding up 10 harmonic tide components), a device that, with progressive refinements, continued to be used for close to a century. </p>\n<p>Being rather charmed by Kelvin’s physicist-with-a-big-yacht persona, I once purchased a letter that Kelvin wrote in 1877 on the letterhead of “Yacht Lalla Rookh”:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img223.png\"><img loading='lazy'\n src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img223.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='300' height=''></a></p>\n<p>The letter—in true academic style—promises that Kelvin will soon send an article he’s been asked to write on elasticity theory. And in fact he did write the article, and it was an <a href='https://archive.org/details/encyclopaedia-britannica-9ed-1875/Vol%207%20%28DEA-ELD%29%20193916234.23/page/796/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>expository one</a> that appeared in the <a href='https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.209714' target=_blank rel=noopener>9th edition of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Kelvin was a prolific (if, to modern ears, sometimes rather pompous) writer, who took exposition seriously. And indeed—finding the textbooks available to him as a professor inadequate—he worked over the course of a dozen years (1855–1867) with his (and Maxwell&#8217;s) friend Peter Guthrie Tait to produce the influential <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/treatisnatphil01kelvrich/page/n7/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Treatise on Natural Philosophy</a></em>. </p>\n<p>Kelvin explored many topics and theories, some more immediately successful than others. In the 1870s he suggested that perhaps <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-14--history-of-elementary-particles/'>atoms might be knotted vortices</a> in the (luminiferous) aether (causing Tait to begin developing knot theory)—a hypothesis that&#8217;s in some sense a Victorian prelude to modern ideas about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>particles in our Physics Project</a>.</p>\n<p>Throughout his life, Kelvin was a devout Christian, writing that &#8220;The more thoroughly I conduct scientific research, the more I believe science excludes atheism.” And indeed this belief seems to make an appearance in his implication that humans—presumably as a result of their special relationship with God—might avoid the Second Law. But more significant at the time was Kelvin&#8217;s skepticism about Charles Darwin&#8217;s 1859 theory of natural selection, believing that there must in the end be a &#8220;continually guiding and controlling intelligence&#8221;. Despite being somewhat ridiculed for it, Kelvin talked about the possibility that <a href='https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/608/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>life might have come to Earth from elsewhere via meteorites</a>, believing that his estimates of the age of the Earth (which didn&#8217;t take into account radioactivity) made it too young for the things Darwin described to have occurred.</p>\n<p>By the 1870s, Kelvin had become a distinguished man of science, receiving all sorts of honors, assignments and invitations. And in 1876, for example, he was invited to Philadelphia to chair the committee judging electrical inventions at the US Centennial International Exhibition, notably reporting, in the terms of the time:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img224.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/670/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img224.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='460' height=''></a></p>\n<p>Then in 1892 a <a href='https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/904/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>&#8220;peerage of the realm&#8221; was conferred</a> on him by Queen Victoria. His wife (he had remarried) and various friends (including Charles Darwin’s son George) suggested he pick the title “Kelvin”, after the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Kelvin' target=_blank rel=noopener>River Kelvin</a> that flowed by the university in Glasgow. And by the end of his life “Lord Kelvin” had accumulated enough honorifics that they were just summarized with “&#8230;” (the MD was an honorary degree conferred by the University of Heidelberg because “<a href='https://archive.org/details/b31360403_0002/page/1108/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>it was the only one at their disposal which he did not already possess</a>”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img225.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/mathematicalphys06kelvuoft/page/n9/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img225.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='555' height='143'> </a></p>\n<p>And when Kelvin died in 1907 he was given a state funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey near Newton and Darwin.</p>\n<h3>James Clerk Maxwell (1831&ndash;1879)</h3>\n<p>James Clerk Maxwell lived only 48 years but in that time managed to do a remarkable amount of important science. His early years were spent on a 1500-acre family estate (inherited by his father) in a fairly remote part of Scotland—to which he would return later. He was an only child and was homeschooled—initially by his mother, until she died, when he was 8. At 10 he went to an upscale school in Edinburgh, and by the age of 14 had written his <a href='https://archive.org/details/scientificpapers01maxw/page/n37/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>first scientific paper</a>. At 16 he went as an undergraduate to the University of Edinburgh, then, effectively as a graduate student, to Cambridge—coming second in the final exams (“Second Wrangler”) to a certain <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Routh' target=_blank rel=noopener>Edward Routh</a>, who would spend most of his life coaching other students on those very same exams.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of years, Maxwell was a professor, first in Aberdeen, then in London. In Aberdeen he married the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Clerk_Maxwell' target=_blank rel=noopener>daughter of the university president</a>, who would soon be his <a href='https://archive.org/details/scientificpapers01maxw/page/426/' target=_blank rel=noopener>&#8220;Observer K&#8221;</a> (for “Katherine”) in his classic work on color vision. But after nine fairly strenuous years as a professor, Maxwell in 1865 “retired” to his family estate, supervising a house renovation, and in “rural solitude” (recreationally riding around his estate on horseback with his wife) having the most scientifically productive time of his life. In addition to his work on things like the kinetic theory of gases, he also wrote his 2-volume <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/electricandmagne01maxwrich/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</a></em>, which ultimately took 7 years to finish, and which, with considerable clarity, described his approach to electromagnetism and what are now called “Maxwell’s Equations”. Occasionally, there were hints of his “country life”—like his 1870 “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/232' target=_blank rel=noopener>On Hills and Dales</a>” that in his characteristic mathematicize-everything way gave a kind of “pre-topological” analysis of contour maps (perhaps conceived as he walked half a mile every day down to the mailbox at which journals and correspondence would arrive):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img226.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/240/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img226.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='253' height='350'> </a></p>\n<p>As a person, Maxwell was calm, reserved and unassuming, yet cheerful and charming—and given to <a href='https://archive.org/details/lifeofjamesclerk00camprich/page/576' target=_blank rel=noopener>writing (arguably sometimes sophomoric) poetry</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img227.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/lifeofjamesclerk00camprich/page/279/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img227.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='390'> </a></p>\n<p>With a certain sense of the absurd, he would occasionally publish satirical pieces in <em>Nature</em>, signing them <em>dp</em>/<em>dt</em>, which in the thermodynamic notation created by his friend Tait was equal to JCM, which were his initials. Maxwell liked games and tricks, and spinning tops featured prominently in some of his work. He enjoyed children, though never had any of his own. As a lecturer, he prepared diligently, but often got too sophisticated for his audience. In writing, though, he showed both great clarity and great erudition, for example freely quoting Latin and Greek in articles he wrote for the 9th edition of the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (of which he was scientific co-editor) on topics such as “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/445/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Atom</a>” and “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/763/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Ether</a>”. </p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, Maxwell was quite an enthusiast of diagrams and visual presentation (even writing an article on “<a href='https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.111835/page/647/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Diagrams</a>” for the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>). He was also a capable experimentalist, making many measurements (sometimes along with his wife), and in 1861 creating the first color photograph.</p>\n<p>In 1871 William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, who had studied math in Cambridge, and was now chancellor of the university, agreed to put up the money to build what became the Cavendish Laboratory and to endow a new chair of experimental physics. Kelvin having turned down the job, it was offered to the still-rather-obscure Maxwell, who somewhat reluctantly accepted—with the result that for several years he spent much of his time supervising the design and building of the lab. </p>\n<p>The lab was finished in 1874, but then William Cavendish dropped on Maxwell a large collection of papers from his great uncle Henry Cavendish, who had been a wealthy “gentleman scientist” of the late 1700s and (among other things) the discoverer of hydrogen. Maxwell liked history (as some of us do!), noticed that Cavendish had discovered Ohm’s law 50 years before Ohm, and in the end spent several years painstakingly editing and annotating the papers into a <a href='https://archive.org/details/electricalresear00caveuoft/' target=_blank rel=noopener>500-page book</a>. By 1879 Maxwell was finally ready to energetically concentrate on physics research again, but, sadly, in the fall of that year his health failed, and he died at the age of 48—having succumbed to stomach cancer, as his mother also had at almost the same age.</p>\n<h3>J. Willard Gibbs (1839&ndash;1903)</h3>\n<p>Gibbs was born near the Yale campus, and died there 64 years later, in the same house where he had lived since he was 7 years old (save for three years spent visiting European universities as a young man, and regular summer “out-in-nature” vacations). <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs_Sr.' target=_blank rel=noopener>His father</a> (who, like, “our Gibbs” was named “Josiah Willard”—making “our Gibbs” be called “Willard”) came from an old and distinguished intellectual and religious New England family, and was a professor of sacred languages at Yale. Willard Gibbs went to college and graduate school at Yale, and then spent his whole career as a professor at Yale. </p>\n<p>He was, it seems, a quiet, modest and rather distant person, who radiated a certain serenity, regularly attended church, had a small circle of friends and lived with his two sisters (and the husband and children of one of them). He diligently discharged his teaching responsibilities, though his lectures were very sparsely attended, and he seems not to have been thought forceful enough in dealing with people to have been called on for many administrative tasks—though he became the treasurer of his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_School' target=_blank rel=noopener>former high school</a>, and himself was careful enough with money that by the end of his life he had accumulated what would <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%24100k+1903+dollars'>now be several million dollars</a>.</p>\n<p>He had begun his academic career in practical engineering, for example <a href='https://patents.google.com/patent/US53971A' target=_blank rel=noopener>patenting an &#8220;improved [railway] car-brake&#8221;</a>, but was soon drawn in more mathematical directions, favoring a certain clarity and minimalism of formulation, and a cleanliness, if not brevity, of exposition. His work on thermodynamics (initially published in the rather obscure <em>Transactions of the Connecticut Academy</em>) was divided into two parts: the first, in the 1870s, concentrating on macroscopic equilibrium properties, and second, in the 1890s, concentrating on microscopic “statistical mechanics” (as Gibbs called it). Even before he started on thermodynamics, he’d been interested in electromagnetism, and between his two “thermodynamic periods”, he again worked on electromagnetism. He studied Maxwell’s work, and was at first drawn to the then-popular formalism of quaternions—but soon decided to invent his own approach and notation for vector analysis, which at first he presented only in notes for his students, though it later became widely adopted. </p>\n<p>And while Gibbs did increasingly mathematical work, he never seems to have identified as a mathematician, modestly stating that “If I have had any success in mathematical physics, it is, I think, because I have been able to dodge mathematical difficulties.” His last work was his book on statistical mechanics, which—with considerable effort and perhaps damage to his health—he finished in time for publication in connection with the Yale bicentennial in 1901 (an event which notably also brought a visit from Kelvin), only to die soon thereafter.</p>\n<p>Gibbs had a few graduate students at Yale, a notable one being <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lee de Forest</a>, inventor of the vacuum tube (triode) electronic amplifier, and radio entrepreneur. (de Forest’s 1899 PhD thesis was entitled “Reflection of Hertzian Waves from the Ends of Parallel Wires”.) Another student of Gibbs was <a href='https://ethw.org/Lynde_Wheeler' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lynde Wheeler</a>, who became a government radio scientist, and who wrote a biography of Gibbs, of which I have a copy bought years ago at a used bookstore—that I was now just about to put back on a shelf when I opened its front cover and found an inscription:</p>\n<p>\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img228.png\"><img loading='lazy'\n src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img228.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='620' height='305'> </a></p>\n<p>And, yes, it’s a small world, and “To Willard” refers to Gibbs’s sister’s son (<a href='https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/creator/145649#/titles' target=_blank rel=noopener>Willard Gibbs Van Name</a>, who became a naturalist and wrote a <a href='https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015067216146&#038;view=1up&#038;seq=5' target=_blank rel=noopener>1929 book about national park deforestation</a>).</p>\n<h3>Ludwig Boltzmann (1844&ndash;1906)</h3>\n<p>Of the people we’re discussing, Boltzmann is the one whose career was most focused on the Second Law. Boltzmann grew up in Austria, where his father was a civil servant (who died when Boltzmann was 15) and his mother was something of an heiress. Boltzmann did his PhD at the University of Vienna, where his professor notably gave him a copy of some of Maxwell’s papers, together with an English grammar book. Boltzmann started publishing his own papers near the end of his PhD, and soon landed a position as a professor of mathematical physics in Graz. Four years later he moved to Vienna as a professor of mathematics, soon moving back to Graz as a professor of “general and experimental physics”—a position he would keep for 14 years. </p>\n<p>He’d married in 1876, and had 5 children, though a son died in 1889, leaving 3 daughters and another son. Boltzmann was apparently a clear and lively lecturer, as well as a spirited and eager debater. He seems, at least in his younger years, to have been a happy and gregarious person, with a strong taste for music—and some charming do-it-your-own-way tendencies. For example, wanting to provide fresh milk for his children, he decided to just buy a cow, which he then led from the market through the streets—though had to consult his colleague, the professor of zoology, to find out how to milk it. Boltzmann was a capable experimental physicist, as well as a creator of gadgets, and a technology enthusiast—promoting the idea of airplanes (an application for gas theory!) and noting their potential power as a means of transportation.</p>\n<p>Boltzmann had always had mood swings, but by the early 1890s he claimed they were getting worse. It didn’t help that he was worn down by administrative work, and had worsening asthma and increasing nearsightedness (that he’d thought might be a sign of going blind). He moved positions, but then came back to Vienna, where he embarked on writing what would become a 2-volume book on <em>Gas Theory—</em>in effect contextualizing his life’s work. The introduction to the first volume laments that “gas theory has gone out of fashion in Germany”. The introduction to the second volume, written in 1898 when Boltzmann was 54, then says that “attacks on the theory of gases have begun to increase”, and <a href='https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/page/n212/mode/1up' target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\n&#8230; it would be a great tragedy for science if the theory of gases were temporarily thrown into oblivion because of a momentary hostile attitude toward it, as, for example, was the wave theory [of light] because of Newton’s authority.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">\nI am conscious of being only an individual struggling weakly against the stream of time. But it still remains in my power to contribute in such a way that, when the theory of gases is again revived, not too much will have to be rediscovered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But even as he was writing this, Boltzmann had pretty much already wound down his physics research, and had basically switched to exposition, and to philosophy. He moved jobs again, but in 1902 again came back to Vienna, but now also as a professor of philosophy. He gave an inaugural lecture, first quoting his predecessor <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Ernst+Mach'>Ernst Mach</a> (1838–1916) as saying “I do not believe that atoms exist”, then discussing the philosophical relations between reality, perception and models. Elsewhere he discussed things like his view of the different philosophical character of models associated with differential equations and with atomism—and he even wrote an article on the general topic of “Models” for <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (which curiously also talks about “in pure mathematics, especially geometry, models constructed of papier-mâché and plaster”). Sometimes Boltzmann’s philosophy could be quite polemical, like his attack on <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Arthur+Schopenhauer\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Schopenhauer</a>, that ends by saying that “men [should] be freed from the spiritual migraine that is called metaphysics”. </p>\n<p>Then, in 1904, Boltzmann addressed the Vienna Philosophical Society (a kind of predecessor of the Vienna Circle) on the subject of a &#8220;Reply to a Lecture on Happiness by Professor Ostwald”. <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Wilhelm+Ostwald'>Wilhelm Ostwald</a> (1853–1932) (a chemist and social reformer, who was a personal friend of Boltzmann’s, but intellectual adversary) had proposed the concept of “energy of will” to apply mathematical physics ideas to psychology. Boltzmann mocked this, describing its faux formalism as “dangerous for science”. Meanwhile, Boltzmann gives his own Darwinian theory for the origin of happiness, based essentially on the idea that unhappiness is needed as a way to make organisms improve their circumstances in the struggle for survival. </p>\n<p>Boltzmann himself was continuing to have problems that he attributed to then-popular but very vague &#8220;diagnosis&#8221; of &#8220;neurasthenia&#8221;, and had even briefly been in a psychiatric hospital. But he continued to do things like travel. He visited the US three times, in 1905 going to California (mainly Berkeley)—which led him to write a witty piece entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/populreschrifte00boltgoog/page/n438/mode/\\\n2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>A German Professor&#8217;s Trip to El Dorado</a>&#8221; that concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Yes, America will achieve great things. I believe in these people, even after seeing them at work in a setting where they’re not at their best: integrating and differentiating at a theoretical physics seminar&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 1905 Einstein published his Boltzmann-and-atomism-based results on Brownian motion and on photons. But it’s not clear Boltzmann ever knew about them. For Boltzmann was sinking further. Perhaps he’d overexerted himself in California, but by the spring of 1906 he said he was no longer able to teach. In the summer he went with his family to an Italian seaside resort in an attempt to rejuvenate. But a day before they were to return to Vienna he failed to join his family for a swim, and his youngest daughter found him hanged in his hotel room, dead at the age of 62.</p>\n<p><!--Section 13 The Basic Arc of the Story--></p>\n<h2 id='coarse-graining-and-the-&ldquo;modern-formulation&rdquo;'>Coarse-Graining and the &ldquo;Modern Formulation&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>After Gibbs’s 1902 book introducing the idea of ensembles, most of the language used (at least <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics' target=_blank rel=noopener>until now</a>!) to discuss the Second Law was basically in place. But in 1912 one additional term—representing a concept already implicit in Gibbs’s work—was added: coarse-graining. Gibbs had discussed how the phase fluid representing possible states of a system could be elaborately mixed by the mechanical time evolution of the system. But realistic practical measurements could not be expected to probe all the details of the distribution of phase fluid; instead one could say that they would only sample “coarse-grained” aspects of it.</p>\n<p>The term “coarse-graining” first appeared in a survey article entitled “The Conceptual Foundations of the Statistical Approach in Mechanics”, written for the German-language <em>Encyclopaedia of the Mathematical Sciences</em> by Boltzmann’s former student <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Paul Ehrenfest</a>, and his wife <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Tatiana Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img229.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/52/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img229.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The article also introduced all sorts of now-standard notation, and in many ways can be read as a final summary of what was achieved in the original development around the foundations of thermodynamics and the Second Law. (And indeed the article was sufficiently “final” that when it was republished as a <a href='https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>book in 1959</a> it could still be presented as usefully summarizing the state of things.)</p>\n<p>Looking at the article now, though, it’s notable how much it recognized was not at all settled about the Second Law and its foundations. It places Boltzmann squarely at the center, stating in its preface:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img230.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/n9/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img230.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>The section titles are already revealing:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img231.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/n15/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img231.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And soon they’re starting to talk about “loose ends”, and lots of them. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#ergodicity-and-global-behavior'>Ergodicity</a> is something one can talk about, but there’s no known example (and with this definition it was later proved that there couldn’t be):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img232.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/22/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img232.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But, they point out, it’s something Boltzmann needed in order to justify his results:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img233.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/24/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img233.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Soon they’re talking about Boltzmann’s sloppiness in his discussion of the <em>H</em> curve:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img234.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/24/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img234.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And then they’re on to talking about Gibbs, and the gaps in his reasoning:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img235.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/55/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img235.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In the end they conclude:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img236.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/conceptualfounda0000ehre/page/67/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img236.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='420' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In other words, even though people now seem to be buying all these results, there are still plenty of issues with their foundations. And despite people’s implicit assumptions, we can in no way say that the Second Law has been “proved”.</p>\n<p><!--Section 14 Radiant Heat, the Second Law and Quantum Mechanics--></p>\n<h2 id='radiant-heat,-the-second-law-and-quantum-mechanics'>Radiant Heat, the Second Law and Quantum Mechanics</h2>\n<p>It was already realized in the 1600s that when objects get hot they emit “heat radiation”—which can be transferred to other bodies as “radiant heat”. And particularly following Maxwell’s work in the 1860s on electrodynamics it came to be accepted that radiant heat was associated with electromagnetic waves propagating in the “luminiferous aether”. But unlike the molecules from which it was increasingly assumed that one could think of matter as being made, these electromagnetic waves were always treated—particularly on the basis of their mathematical foundations in calculus—as fundamentally continuous. </p>\n<p>But how might this relate to the Second Law? Could it be, perhaps, that the Second Law should ultimately be attributed not to some property of the large-scale mechanics of discrete molecules, but rather to a feature of continuous radiant heat?</p>\n<p>The basic equations assumed for mechanics—originally due to Newton—are reversible. But what about the equations for electrodynamics? Maxwell’s equations are in and of themselves also reversible. But when one thinks about their solutions for actual electromagnetic radiation, there can be fundamental irreversibility. And the reason is that it’s natural to describe the emission of radiation (say from a hot body), but then to assume that, once emitted, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p455--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>the radiation just &#8220;escapes to infinity”</a>—rather than ever reversing the process of emission by being absorbed by some other body.</p>\n<p>All the various people we’ve discussed above, from Clausius to Gibbs, made occasional remarks about the possibility that the Second Law—whether or not it could be “derived mechanically”—would still ultimately work, if nothing else, because of the irreversible emission of radiant heat.</p>\n<p>But the person who would ultimately be most intimately connected to these issues was Max Planck—though in the end the somewhat-confused connection to the Second Law would recede in importance relative to what emerged from it, which was basically the raw material that led to quantum theory.</p>\n<p>As a student of Helmholtz&#8217;s in Berlin, Max Planck got interested in thermodynamics, and in 1879 wrote a 61-page PhD thesis entitled “On the Second Law of Mechanical Heat Theory”. It was a traditional (if slightly streamlined) discussion of the Second Law, very much based on Clausius’s approach (and even with the same title as <a href='https://archive.org/details/berdenzweitenha00claugoog/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>Clausius&#8217;s 1867 paper</a>)—and without any mention whatsoever of Boltzmann:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img237.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOctQEACAAJ&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&#038;cad=0#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img237.png\" width='620' height='446' /></a></p>\n<p>For most of the two decades that followed, Planck continued to use similar methods to study the Second Law in various settings (e.g. elastic materials, chemical mixtures, etc.)—and meanwhile ascended the German academic physics hierarchy, ending up as a professor of theoretical physics in Berlin. Planck was in many ways a physics traditionalist, not wanting to commit to things like “newfangled” molecular ideas—and as late as 1897 (with his assistant Zermelo having made his “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-recurrence-objection'>recurrence objection</a>” to Boltzmann’s work) still saying that he would “abstain completely from any definite assumption about the nature of heat”. But regardless of its foundations, Planck was a true believer in the Second Law, for example in 1891 asserting that it “must extend to all forces of nature &#8230; not only thermal and chemical, but also electrical and other”.</p>\n<p>And in 1895 he began to investigate how the Second Law applied to electrodynamics—and in particular to the &#8220;heat radiation&#8221; that it had become clear (particularly through <a href=\"https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hertz_Heinrich/\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Heinrich Hertz</a>’s (1857–1894) experiments) was of electromagnetic origin. In 1896 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wien/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wilhelm Wien</a> (1864–1928) suggested that the heat radiation (or what we now call <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=blackbody+radiation'>blackbody radiation</a>) was in effect produced by tiny Hertzian oscillators with velocities following a Maxwell distribution.</p>\n<p>Planck, however, had a different viewpoint, instead introducing the concept of “natural radiation”—a kind of intrinsic thermal equilibrium state for radiation, with an associated intrinsic entropy. He imagined “resonators” interacting through Maxwell’s equations with this radiation, and in 1899 invented a (rather arbitrary) formula for the entropy of these resonators, that implied (through the laws of electrodynamics) that overall entropy would increase—just like the Second Law said—and when the entropy was maximized it gave the same result as Wien for the spectrum of blackbody radiation. In early 1900 he sharpened his treatment and began to suggest that with his approach Wien’s form of the blackbody spectrum would emerge as a provable consequence of the universal validity of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>But right around that time experimental results arrived that disagreed with Wien’s law. And by the end of 1900 Planck had a new hypothesis, for which he finally began to rely on ideas from Boltzmann. Planck started from the idea that he should treat the behavior of his resonators statistically. But how then could he compute their entropy? He quotes (for the first time ever) his simplification of Boltzmann’s formula for entropy:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img238.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/originalpapersin00plan/page/38/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img238.png\" width='620' height=''/></a></p>\n<p>As he <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\" target=_blank rel=noopener>explains it</a>—claiming now, after years of criticizing Boltzmann, that this is a “theorem”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">We now set the entropy <em>S</em> of the system proportional to the logarithm of its probability <em>W</em>&#8230; In my opinion this actually serves as a definition of the probability <em>W</em>, since in the basic assumptions of electromagnetic theory there is no definite evidence for such a probability. The suitability of this expression is evident from the outset, in view of its simplicity and close connection with a theorem from kinetic gas theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But how could he figure out the probability for a resonator to have a certain energy, and thus a certain entropy? For this he turns directly to Boltzmann—who, as a matter of convenience in his 1877 paper had introduced discrete values of energy for molecules. Planck simply states that it’s “necessary” (i.e. to get the experimentally right answer) to treat the resonator energy “not as a continuous, infinitely divisible quantity, but as a discrete quantity composed of an integral number of finite equal parts”. As an example of how this works he gives a table just like the one in <a href='https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012336965?urlappend=%3Bseq=178%3Bownerid=13510798885803827-180' target=_blank rel=noopener>Boltzmann&#8217;s paper</a> from nearly a quarter of a century earlier:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img239.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img239.png\" width=\"629\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>Pretty soon he’s deriving the entropy of a resonator as a function of its energy, and its discrete energy unit ϵ:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img240.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img240.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>Connecting this to blackbody radiation he claims that each resonator’s energy unit is connected to its frequency according to</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img241.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img241.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>so that its entropy is</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img242.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img242.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>“[where] <em>h</em> and <em>k</em> are universal constants”. </p>\n<p>In a similar situation Boltzmann had effectively taken the limit ϵ&rarr;0, because that’s what he believed corresponded to (“calculus-based”) physical reality.

And in doing this it takes him only a few lines to derive what’s now called the Planck spectrum for blackbody radiation (i.e. for “radiation in equilibrium”):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img243.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img243.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"/></a></p>\n<p>And then by fitting this result to the data of the time he gets “Planck’s constant” (the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=planck%27s+constant'>correct result is 6.62</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img244.png\" data-url=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Physikalische_Abhandlungen_und_Vortr%C3%A4ge.html?id=YEUCwAEACAAJ\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img244.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, this was essentially the birth of quantum mechanics—essentially as a spinoff from an attempt to extend the domain of the Second Law. Planck himself didn’t seem to internalize what he’d done for at least another decade. And it was really Albert Einstein’s 1905 analysis of the photoelectric effect that made the concept of the quantization of energy that Planck had assumed (more as a calculational hypothesis than anything else) seem to be something of real physical significance—that would lead to the whole development of quantum mechanics, notably in the 1920s. </p>\n<p><!--Section 15 Are Molecules Real? Continuous Versus Discrete--></p>\n<h2 id='are-molecules-real?-continuous-versus-discrete'>Are Molecules Real? Continuous Versus Discrete</h2>\n<p>As we discussed at the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-basic-arc-of-the-story' target=_blank rel=noopener>very beginning above</a>, already in antiquity there was a notion that at least things like solids and liquids might not ultimately be continuous (as they seemed), but might instead be made of large numbers of discrete “atomic” elements. By the 1600s there was also the idea that light might be “corpuscular”—and, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-second-law-is-formulated' target=_blank rel=noopener>as we discussed above</a>, gases too. But meanwhile, there were opposing theories that espoused continuity—like the caloric theory of heat. And particularly with the success of calculus, there was a strong tendency to develop theories that showed continuity—and to which calculus could be applied. </p>\n<p>But in the early 1800s—notably with the work of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=John+Dalton'>John Dalton</a> (1766–1844)—there began to be evidence that there were discrete entities participating in chemical reactions. Meanwhile, as we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-kinetic-theory-of-gases' target=_blank rel=noopener>discussed above</a>, the success of the kinetic theory of gases gave increasing evidence for some kind of—at least effectively—discrete elements in gases. But even people like Boltzmann and Maxwell were reluctant to assert that gases really were made of molecules. And there were plenty of well-known scientists (like Ernst Mach) who “opposed atomism”, often effectively on the grounds that in science one should only talk about things one can actually see or experience—not things like atoms that were too small for that.</p>\n<p>But there was something else too: with Newton’s theory of gravitation as a precursor, and then with the investigation of electromagnetic phenomena, there emerged in the 1800s the idea of a “continuous field”. The interpretation of this was fairly clear for something like an elastic solid or a fluid that exhibited continuous deformations. </p>\n<p>Mathematically, things like gravity, magnetism—and heat—seemed to work in similar ways. And it was assumed that this meant that in all cases there had to be some fluid-like “carrier” for the field. And this is what led to ideas like the luminiferous aether as the “carrier” of electromagnetic waves. And, by the way, the idea of an aether wasn’t even obviously incompatible with the idea of atoms; Kelvin, for example, had a theory that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1043e/'>atoms were vortices (perhaps knotted) in the aether</a>. </p>\n<p>But how does this all relate to the Second Law? Well, particularly through the work of Boltzmann there came to be the impression that given atomism, probability theory could essentially “prove” the Second Law. A few people tried to clarify the formal details (as we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#the-second-law-is-formulated' target=_blank rel=noopener>discussed above</a>), but it seemed like any final conclusion would have to await the validation (or not) of atomism, which in the late 1800s was still a thoroughly controversial theory.</p>\n<p>By the first decade of the 1900s, however, the fortunes of atomism began to change. In 1897 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=J.J.+Thomson'>J. J. Thomson</a> (1856–1940) discovered the electron, showing that electricity was fundamentally “corpuscular”. And in 1900 Planck had (at least calculationally) introduced discrete quanta of energy. But it was the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers' target=_blank rel=noopener>three classic papers of Albert Einstein in 1905</a> that—in their different ways—began to secure the ultimate success of atomism.</p>\n<p>First there was his paper “<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1905_17_1/page/132/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>On a Heuristic View about the Production and Transformation of Light</a>”, which began:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic [radiation] differs in a profound, essential way from the current theoretical models of gases and other matter. We consider the state of a material body to be completely determined by the positions and velocities of a finite number of atoms and electrons, albeit a very large number. But the electromagnetic state of a region of space is described by continuous functions &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then points out that optical experiments look only at time-averaged electromagnetic fields, and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1905_17_1/page/132/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In particular, blackbody radiation, photoluminescence, [the photoelectric effect] and other phenomena associated with the generation and transformation of light seem better modeled by assuming that the energy of light is distributed discontinuously in space. According to this picture, the energy of a light wave emitted from a point source is not spread continuously over ever larger volumes, but consists of a finite number of energy quanta that are spatially localized at points of space, move without dividing and are absorbed or generated only as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, he’s suggesting that light is “corpuscular”, and that energy is quantized. When he begins to get into details, he’s soon talking about the “entropy of radiation”—and, then, in three core sections of his paper, he’s basing what he’s doing on “Boltzmann’s principle”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img245.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_annalen-der-physik_1905_17_1/page/138/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img245.png\" width='584' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Two months later, Einstein produced another paper: “Investigations on the Theory of Brownian Motion”. Back in 1827 the British botanist <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Robert+Brown&#038;assumption=%7B%22C%22%2C+%22Robert+Brown%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22Person%22%7D&#038;assumption=%7B%22DPClash%22%2C+%22PersonE%22%2C+%22Robert+Brown%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%22RobertBrown%3A%3Ahqyc2%22%7D'>Robert Brown</a> (1773–1858) had seen under a microscope tiny grains (ejected by pollen) randomly jiggling around in water. Einstein <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/andp.19053220806\" target=_blank rel=noopener>began his paper</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In this paper it will be shown that according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of microscopically visible size suspended in a liquid will perform movements of such magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope, on account of the molecular motions of heat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He doesn’t explicitly mention Boltzmann in this paper, but there’s Boltzmann’s formula again:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img246.png\" data-url=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/andp.19053220806\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img246.png\" width='370' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And by the next year it’s become clear experimentally that, yes, the jiggling Robert Brown had seen was in fact the result of impacts from discrete, real water molecules.</p>\n<p>Einstein’s third 1905 paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”—in which he introduced <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#deriving-special-relativity'>relativity theory</a>—wasn’t so obviously related to atomism. But in showing that the luminiferous aether will (as Einstein put it) “prove superfluous” he was removing what was (<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>almost!</a>) the last remaining example of something continuous in physics.</p>\n<p>In the years after 1905, the evidence for atomism mounted rapidly, segueing in the 1920s into the development of quantum mechanics. But what happened with the Second Law? By the time atomism was generally accepted, the generation of physicists that had included Boltzmann and Gibbs was gone. And while the Second Law was routinely invoked in expositions of thermodynamics, questions about its foundations were largely forgotten. Except perhaps for one thing: people remembered that “proofs” of the Second Law had been controversial, and had depended on the controversial hypothesis of atomism. But—they appear to have reasoned—now that atomism isn’t controversial anymore, it follows that the Second Law is indeed “satisfactorily proved”. And, after all, there were all sorts of other things to investigate in physics.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of “footnotes” to this story. The first has to do with Einstein. Right before Einstein’s remarkable series of papers in 1905, what was he working on? The answer is: the Second Law! In 1902 he wrote a paper entitled “Kinetic Theory of Thermal Equilibrium and of the Second Law of Thermodynamics”. Then in 1903: “A Theory of the Foundations of Thermodynamics”. And in 1904: “<a href=\"https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-doc/135\" target=_blank rel=noopener>On the General Molecular Theory of Heat</a>”. The latter paper claims:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">I derive an expression for the entropy of a system, which is completely analogous to the one found by Boltzmann for ideal gases and assumed by Planck in his theory of radiation. Then I give a simple derivation of the Second Law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what&#8217;s actually there is not quite what&#8217;s advertised:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img247.png\" data-url=\"https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-doc/136\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img247.png\" width='470' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>It’s a short argument—about interactions between a collection of heat reservoirs. But in a sense it already assumes its answer, and certainly doesn’t provide any kind of fundamental “derivation of the Second Law”. And this was the last time Einstein ever explicitly wrote about deriving the Second Law. Yes, in those days it was just too hard, even for Einstein.</p>\n<p>There’s another footnote to this story too. As we said, at the beginning of the twentieth century it had become clear that lots of things that had been thought to be continuous were in fact discrete. But there was an important exception: space. Ever since <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Euclid</a> (~300 BC), space had almost universally been implicitly assumed to be continuous. And, yes, when quantum mechanics was being built, people did wonder about whether space might be discrete too (and even in 1917 <a href='https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/314' target=_blank rel=noopener>Einstein expressed the opinion</a> that eventually it would turn out to be). But over time the idea of continuous space (and time) got so entrenched in the fabric of physics that when I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-7--space-as-a-network'>started seriously developing</a> the ideas that became our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> based on space as a discrete network (or what—in homage to the dynamical theory of heat one might call the “dynamical theory of space”) it seemed to many people quite shocking. And looking back at the controversies of the late 1800s around atomism and its application to the Second Law it’s charming how familiar many of the arguments against atomism seem. Of course it turns out they were wrong—as they <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>seem again to be</a> in the case of space.</p>\n<p><!--Section 16 The Twentieth Century--></p>\n<h2 id='the-twentieth-century'>The Twentieth Century</h2>\n<p>The foundations of thermodynamics were a hot topic in physics in the latter half of the nineteenth century—worked on by many of the most prominent physicists of the time. But by the early twentieth century it’d been firmly eclipsed by other areas of physics. And going forward it’d receive precious little attention—with most physicists just assuming it’d “somehow been solved”, or at least “didn’t need to be worried about”. </p>\n<p>As a practical matter, thermodynamics in its basic equilibrium form nevertheless became very widely used in engineering and in chemistry. And in physics, there was steadily increasing interest in doing statistical mechanics—typically enumerating states of systems (quantum or otherwise), weighted as they would be in idealized thermal equilibrium. In mathematics, the field of ergodic theory developed, though for the most part it concerned itself with systems (such as ordinary differential equations) involving few variables—making it relevant to the Second Law essentially only by analogy.</p>\n<p>There were a few <a href='https://archive.org/details/sim_mathematische-annalen_1909_67/page/354/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>attempts to &#8220;axiomatize&#8221; the Second Law</a>, but mostly only at a macroscopic level, not asking about its microscopic origins. And there were also attempts to generalize the Second Law to make robust statements not just about equilibrium and the fact that it would be reached, but also about what would happen in systems driven to be in some manner away from equilibrium. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem about small perturbations from equilibrium—established in the mid-1900s, though anticipated in Einstein&#8217;s work on Brownian motion—was one example of a widely applicable result. And there were also related ideas of “minimum entropy production”—as well as “maximum entropy production”. But for large deviations from equilibrium there <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-6-1--history-of-emergence-of-order/'>really weren&#8217;t convincing general results</a>, and in practice most investigations basically used phenomenological models that didn&#8217;t have obvious connections to the foundations of thermodynamics, or derivations of the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, through most of the twentieth century there were progressively more elaborate mathematical analyses of Boltzmann&#8217;s equation (and the <em>H</em> theorem) and their relation to rigorously derivable but hard-to-manage concepts like the BBGKY hierarchy. But despite occasional claims to the contrary, such approaches ultimately never seem to have been able to make much progress on the core problem of deriving the Second Law. </p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the story of entropy. And in a sense this had three separate threads. The first was the notion of entropy—essentially in the original form defined by Clausius—being used to talk quantitatively about heat in equilibrium situations, usually for either engineering or chemistry. The second—that we&#8217;ll discuss a little more below—was entropy as a qualitative characterization of randomness and degradation. And the third was entropy as a general and formal way to measure the &#8220;effective number of degrees of freedom&#8221; in a system, computed from the log of the number of its achievable states.</p>\n<p>There are definitely correspondences between these different threads. But they&#8217;re in no sense &#8220;obviously equivalent”. And much of the mystery—and confusion—that developed around entropy in the twentieth century came from conflating them. </p>\n<p>Another piece of the story was information theory, which arose in the 1940s. And a core question in information theory is how long an &#8220;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-5--history-of-data-compression/'>optimally compressed</a>&#8221; message will be. And (with various assumptions) the average such length is given by a ∑<em>p</em> log <em>p</em> form that has essentially the same structure as Boltzmann&#8217;s expression for entropy. But even though it&#8217;s &#8220;mathematically like entropy&#8221; this has nothing immediately to do with heat—or even physics; it&#8217;s just an abstract consequence of needing log Ω bits (i.e. log Ω degrees of freedom) to specify one of Ω possibilities. (Still, the coincidence of definitions led to an &#8220;entropy branding&#8221; for various essentially information-theoretic methods, with claims sometimes being made that, for example, the thing called <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-9--estimation-of-parameters-in-probabilistic-models/'>entropy must always be maximized</a> &#8220;because we know that from physics&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>There&#8217;d been an initial thought in the 1940s that there&#8217;d be an &#8220;inevitable Second Law&#8221; for systems that &#8220;did computation&#8221;. The argument was that logical gates (like And and Or) take 2 bits of input (with 4 overall states 11, 10, 01, 00) but give only 1 bit of output (1 or 0), and are therefore fundamentally irreversible. But in the 1970s it became clear that it&#8217;s perfectly possible to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-2--reversible-computation/'>do computation reversibly</a> (say with 2-input, 2-output gates)—and indeed this is what&#8217;s used in the typical formalism for quantum circuits.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>mentioned elsewhere</a>, there were some computer experiments in the 1950s and beyond on model systems—like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>hard sphere gases</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#appendix:-the-backstory-of-the-book-cover-that-started-it-all' target=_blank rel=noopener>nonlinear springs</a>—that showed some sign of Second Law behavior (though less than might have been expected). But the analysis of these systems very much concentrated on various regularities, and not on the effective randomness associated with Second Law behavior. </p>\n<p>In another direction, the 1970s saw the application of thermodynamic ideas to black holes. At first, it was basically a pure analogy. But then quantum field theory calculations <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-9-16--vacuum-fluctuations/'>suggested that black holes should produce thermal radiation</a> as if they had a certain effective temperature. By the late 1990s there were more direct ways to &#8220;compute entropy&#8221; for black holes, by enumerating possible (quantum) configurations consistent with the overall characteristics of the black hole. But such computations in effect assume (time-invariant) equilibrium, and so can&#8217;t be expected to shed light directly on the Second Law.</p>\n<p>Talking about black holes brings up gravity. And in the course of the twentieth century there were scattered efforts to understand the effect of gravity on the Second Law. Would a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1021b/'>self-gravitating gas</a> achieve &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; in the usual sense? Does gravity violate the Second Law? It&#8217;s been difficult to get definitive answers. Many specific simulations of <em>n</em>-body gravitational systems were done, but without global conclusions for the Second Law. And there were cosmological arguments, particularly about the role of gravity in accounting for entropy in the early universe—but not so much about the actual evolution of the universe and the effect of the Second Law on it. </p>\n<p>Yet another direction has involved quantum mechanics. The standard formalism of quantum mechanics—like classical mechanics—is fundamentally reversible. But the formalism for measurement introduced in the 1930s—arguably as something of a hack—is fundamentally irreversible, and there&#8217;ve been continuing arguments about whether this could perhaps &#8220;explain the Second Law&#8221;. (I think our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>Physics Project finally provides more clarity</a> about what&#8217;s going on here—but also tells us this isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s &#8220;needed&#8221; for the Second Law.)</p>\n<p>From the earliest days of the Second Law, there had always been scattered but ultimately unconvincing assertions of exceptions to the Second Law—usually based on elaborately constructed machines that were claimed to be able to achieve perpetual motion &#8220;just powered by heat&#8221;. Of course, the Second Law is a claim about large numbers of molecules, etc.—and shouldn&#8217;t be expected to apply to very small systems. But by the end of the twentieth century it was starting to be possible to make micromachines that could operate on small numbers of molecules (or electrons). And with the right control systems in place, it was argued that such machines could—at least in principle—effectively be used to set up Maxwell&#8217;s demons that would systematically violate the Second Law, albeit on a very small scale.</p>\n<p>And then there was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#the-mechanoidal-phase-and-bulk-molecular-biology' target=_blank rel=noopener>the question of life</a>. Early formulations of the Second Law had tended to talk about applying only to &#8220;inanimate matter”—because somehow living systems didn&#8217;t seem to follow the same process of inexorable &#8220;dissipation to heat&#8221; as inanimate, mechanical systems. And indeed, quite to the contrary, they seemed able to take disordered input (like food) and generate ordered biological structures from it. And indeed, <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Schrodinger/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Erwin Schrödinger</a> (1887–1961), in his 1944 book <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/whatislifephysic0000schr/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>What Is Life?</a></em> talked about &#8220;negative entropy&#8221; associated with life. But he—and many others since—argue that life doesn&#8217;t really violate the Second Law because it&#8217;s not operating in a closed environment where one should expect evolution to equilibrium. Instead, it&#8217;s constantly being driven away from equilibrium, for example by &#8220;organized energy&#8221; ultimately coming from the Sun.</p>\n<p>Still, the concept of at least locally “antithermodynamic” behavior is often considered to be a potential <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--defining-life/'>general signature of life</a>. But already by the early part of the 1900s, with the rise of things like biochemistry, and the decline of concepts like “life force” (which seemed a little like “caloric”), there developed a strong belief that the Second Law must at some level always apply, even to living systems. But, yes, even though the Second Law seemed to say that one can’t “unscramble an egg”, there was still the witty rejoinder: “unless you feed it to a chicken”. </p>\n<p>What about biological evolution? Well, Boltzmann had been an enthusiast of Darwin’s idea of natural selection. And—although it’s not clear he made this connection—it was pointed out many times in the twentieth century that just as in the Second Law reversible underlying dynamics generate an irreversible overall effect, so also in Darwinian evolution effectively reversible individual changes aggregate to what at least <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-5--history-of-biological-complexity/'>Darwin thought was an &#8220;irreversible&#8221; progression</a> to things like the formation of higher organisms.</p>\n<p>The Second Law also found its way into the social sciences—sometimes under names like “entropy pessimism”—most often being used to justify the necessity of “Maxwell’s-demon-like” active intervention or control to prevent the collapse of economic or social systems into random or incoherent states. </p>\n<p>But despite all these applications of the Second Law, the twentieth century largely passed without significant advances in understanding the origin and foundations of the Second Law. Though even by the early 1980s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#statistical-mechanics-and-simple-programs' target=_blank rel=noopener>I was beginning to find results</a>—based on computational ideas—that seemed as if they might finally give a foundational understanding of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics'>what&#8217;s really happening in the Second Law</a>, and the extent to which the Second Law can in the end be “derived” from underlying “mechanical” rules.</p>\n<p><!--Section 17 What the Textbooks Said: The Evolution of Certainty--></p>\n<h2 id='what-the-textbooks-said:-the-evolution-of-certainty'>What the Textbooks Said: The Evolution of Certainty</h2>\n<p>Ask a typical physicist today about the Second Law and they’re likely to be very sure that it’s “just true”. Maybe they’ll consider it “another law of nature” like the conservation of energy, or maybe they’ll think it is something that was “proved long ago” from basic principles of mathematics and mechanics. But as we’ve discussed here, there’s really nowhere in the history of the Second Law that should give us this degree of certainty. So where did all the certainty come from? I think in the end it’s a mixture of a kind of don’t-question-this-it-comes-from-sophisticated-science mystique about the Second Law, together with a century and a half of “increasingly certain” textbooks. So let’s talk about the textbooks.</p>\n<p>While early contributions to what we now call thermodynamics (and particularly those from continental Europe) often got published as monographs, the first “actual textbooks” of thermodynamics already started to appear in the 1860s, with three examples (curiously, all in French) being:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img248.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/principesdether00saingoog/page/n10/mode/1up?ref=ol&#038;view=theater\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img248.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And in these early textbooks what one repeatedly sees is that the Second Law is simply cited—without much comment—as a &#8220;principle&#8221; or &#8220;axiom&#8221; (variously attributed to Carnot, Kelvin or Clausius, and sometimes called “the Principle of Carnot&#8221;), from which theory will be developed. By the 1870s there&#8217;s a bit of confusion starting to creep in, because people are talking about the &#8220;Theorem of Carnot&#8221;. But, at least at first, by this they mean not the Second Law, but the result on the efficiency of heat engines that Carnot derived from this.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, there are questions in textbooks about the validity of the Second Law. A notable one, that we discussed above when we talked about Maxwell’s demon, shows up under the title “Limitation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics” at the end of Maxwell’s 1871 <em>Theory of Heat</em>.</p>\n<p>Tait’s largely historical 1877 <em>Sketch of Thermodynamics</em> notes that, yes, the Second Law hasn’t successfully been proved from the laws of mechanics:</p>\n<p><a

actually “proved the Second Law”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img251.png\"

Law, but then talks about “molecular hypotheses from which Carnot’s principle has been derived”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\"

confusion like the section in Alexandre Gouilly’s (1842–1906) 1877 <em>Mechanical Theory of Heat</em> that’s entitled “Second Fundamental Theorem of Thermodynamics or the Theorem of Carnot”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img253.png\"

practical expositions (that are often incredibly similar to each other) with no particular theoretical discussion of the Second Law, its origins or validity. </p>\n<p>In 1891 there’s an “official

In 1895 Boltzmann published his <em><a href='https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lectures on Gas Theory</a></em>, which includes a final chapter about the <em>H</em> theorem and its relation to the Second Law. Boltzmann <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/n421/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>goes through</a> his mathematical derivations for gases, then (rather over-optimistically) asserts that they&#8217;ll also work for solids and liquids:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">We have looked mainly at processes in gases and have calculated the function <em>H</em> for this case. Yet the laws of probability that govern atomic motion in the solid and liquid states are clearly not qualitatively different &#8230; from those for gases, so that the calculation of the function <em>H</em> corresponding to the entropy would not be more difficult in principle, although to be sure it would involve greater mathematical difficulties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But soon he’s <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/n421/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>discussing the more philosophical aspects of things</a> (and by the time Boltzmann wrote this book, he was a professor of philosophy as well as physics). He says that the usual statement of the Second Law is “asserted phenomenologically as an axiom” (just as he says the infinite divisibility of matter also is at that time):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; the Second Law is formulated in such a way that the unconditional irreversibility of all natural processes is asserted as an axiom, just as general physics based on a purely phenomenological standpoint asserts the unconditional divisibility of matter without limit as an axiom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One might then expect him to say that actually the Second Law is somehow provable from basic physical facts, such as the First Law. But actually his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/10/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>claims</a> about any kind of “general derivation” of the Second Law are rather subdued:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Since however the probability calculus has been verified in so many special cases, I see no reason why it should not also be applied to natural processes of a more general kind. The applicability of the probability calculus to the molecular motion in gases cannot of course be rigorously deduced from the differential equations for the motion of the molecules. It follows rather from the great number of the gas molecules and the length of their paths, by virtue of which the properties of the position in the gas where a molecule undergoes a collision are completely independent of the place where it collided the previous time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But he still believes in the ultimate applicability of the Second Law, and feels he needs to <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\\npage/n422/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>explain why</a>—in the face of the Second Law—the universe as we perceive “still has interesting things going on”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; small isolated regions of the universe will always find themselves “initially” in an improbable state. This method seems to me to be the only way in which one can understand the Second Law—the heat death of each single world—without a unidirectional change of the entire universe from a definite initial state to a final state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, he <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lectures-on-gas-theory-ludwig-boltzmann/\\page/10/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>talks about the idea</a> that elsewhere in the universe things might be different—and that, for example, entropy might be systematically decreasing, making (he suggests) perceived time run backwards:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In the entire universe, the aggregate of all individual worlds, there will however in fact<br />\noccur processes going in the opposite direction. But the beings who observe such processes will simply reckon time as proceeding from the less probable to the more probable states, and it will never be discovered whether they reckon time differently from us, since they are separated from us by eons of time and spatial distances 10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup> times the distance of Sirius—and moreover their language has no relation to ours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most other textbook discussions of thermodynamics are tamer than this, but the rather anthropic-style argument that “we live in a fluctuation” comes up over and over again as an ultimate way to explain the fact that the universe as we perceive it isn’t just a featureless maximum-entropy place.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are roughly three general streams of textbooks that end up discussing the Second Law. There are books about rather practical thermodynamics (of the type pioneered by Clausius), that typically spend most of their time on the equilibrium case. There are books about kinetic theory (effectively pioneered by Maxwell), that typically spend most of their time talking about the dynamics of gas molecules. And then there are books about statistical mechanics (as pioneered by Gibbs) that discuss with various degrees of mathematical sophistication the statistical characteristics of ensembles. </p>\n<p>In each of these streams, many textbooks just treat the Second Law as a starting point that can be taken for granted, then go from there. But particularly when they are written by physicists with broader experience, or when they are intended for a not-totally-specialized audience, textbooks will quite often attempt at least a little justification or explanation for the Second Law—though rather often with a distinct sleight of hand involved.</p>\n<p>For example, when Planck in 1903 wrote his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.154233/page/n7/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Treatise on Thermodynamics</a> he had a chapter in his discussion of the Second Law, misleadingly entitled &#8220;Proof&#8221;. Still, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich/page/86/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>he explains that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">The second fundamental principle of thermodynamics [Second Law] being, like the first, an empirical law, we can speak of its proof only in so far as its total purport may be deduced from a single self-evident proposition. We, therefore, put forward the following proposition as being given directly by experience. It is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle, and produce no effect except the raising of a weight and the cooling of a heat-reservoir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, his “proof” of the Second Law is that nobody has ever managed to build a perpetual motion machine that violates it. (And, yes, this is more than a little reminiscent of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--p-versus-np-questions/'><em>P</em> ≠ <em>NP</em></a>, which, through computational irreducibility, is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#why-the-second-law-works'>related to the Second Law</a>.) But after many pages, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich/page/102/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>he says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In conclusion, we shall briefly discuss the question of the possible limitations to the Second Law. If there exist any such limitations—a view still held by many scientists and philosophers—then this [implies an error] in our starting point: the impossibility of perpetual motion &#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(In the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.154233/page/n119/mode/\\\n2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>1905 edition of the book he adds a footnote</a> that frankly seems bizarre in view of his—albeit perhaps initially unwilling—role in the initiation of quantum theory five years earlier: &#8220;The following discussion, of course, deals with the meaning of the Second Law only insofar as it can be surveyed from the points of view contained in this work avoiding all atomic hypotheses.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>He ends by <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich/page/104/mode/\\2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>basically saying</a> &#8220;maybe one day the Second Law will be considered necessarily true; in the meantime let&#8217;s assume it and see if anything goes wrong&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Presumably the time will come when the principle of the increase of the entropy will be presented without any connection with experiment. Some metaphysicians may even put it forward as being <em>a priori</em> valid. In the meantime, no more effective weapon can be used by both champions and opponents of the Second Law than the indefatigable endeavour to follow the real purport of this law to the utmost consequences, taking the latter one by one to the highest court of appeal experience.

A notable example was in <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Eddington/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Arthur Eddington</a>’s (1882–1944) 1929 <em>The Nature of the Physical World</em>—where now the Second Law is exalted as having the “supreme position among the laws of Nature”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img16.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/natureofphysical00eddi/page/74/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img16.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Although Eddington does admit that the Second Law is probably not “mathematically derivable”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img17.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/natureofphysical00eddi/page/76/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img17.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And even though in the twentieth century questions about thermodynamics and the Second Law weren’t considered “top physics topics”, some top physicists did end up talking about them, if nothing else in general textbooks they wrote. Thus, for example, in the 1930s and 1940s people like <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermi/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Enrico Fermi</a> (1901–1954) and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Pauli/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfgang Pauli</a> (1900–1958) wrote in some detail about the Second Law—though rather strenuously avoided discussing foundational issues about it. </p>\n<p><a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Lev Landau</a> (1908–1968), however, was a different story. In 1933 he wrote a paper “<a href='https://archive.org/details/d.-ter-haar-collected-papers-of-l.-d.-landau/page/69/mode/1up?q=69' target=_blank rel=noopener>On the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Universe</a>” which basically argues that our everyday experience is only possible because “the world as a whole does not obey the laws of thermodynamics”—and suggests that perhaps relativistic quantum mechanics (which he says, quoting <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bohr_Niels/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Niels Bohr</a> (1885–1962), could be crucial in the center of stars) might fundamentally violate the Second Law. (And yes, even today it’s not clear how “relativistic temperature” works.)</p>\n<p>But this kind of outright denial of the Second Law had disappeared by the time Lev Landau and <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lifshitz/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Evgeny Lifshitz</a> (1915–1985) wrote the 1951 version of their book <em>Statistical Mechanics</em>—though they still <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n40/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>showed skepticism</a> about its origins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">There is no doubt that the foregoing simple formulations [of the Second Law] accord with reality; they are confirmed by all our everyday observations. But when we consider more closely the problem of the physical nature and origin of these laws of behaviour, substantial difficulties arise, which to some extent have not yet been overcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Their book <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n40/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continues</a>, discussing Boltzmann’s fluctuation argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Firstly, if we attempt to apply statistical physics to the entire universe &#8230; we immediately encounter a glaring contradiction between theory and experiment. According to the results of statistics, the universe ought to be in a state of complete statistical equilibrium. &#8230; Everyday experience shows us, however, that the properties of Nature bear no resemblance to those of an equilibrium system; and astronomical results show that the same is true throughout the vast region of the Universe accessible to our observation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">We might try to overcome this contradiction by supposing that the part of the Universe which we observe is just some huge fluctuation in a system which is in equilibrium as a whole. The fact that we have been able to observe this huge fluctuation might be explained by supposing that the existence of such a fluctuation is a necessary condition for the existence of an observer (a condition for the occurrence of biological evolution). This argument, however, is easily disproved, since a fluctuation within, say, the volume of the solar system only would be very much more probable, and would be sufficient to allow the existence of an observer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What do they think is the way out? The <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n40/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>effect of gravity</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; in the general theory of relativity, the Universe as a whole must be regarded not as a closed system but as a system in a variable gravitational field. Consequently the application of the law of increase of entropy does not prove that statistical equilibrium must necessarily exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But they say this isn’t the end of the problem, essentially noting the reversibility objection. How should this be overcome? First, they suggest the solution might be that the observer somehow “artificially closes off the history of a system”, but then they add:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">Such a dependence of the laws of physics on the nature of an observer is quite inadmissible, of course.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n41/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>continue</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">At the present time it is not certain whether the law of increase of entropy thus formulated can be derived on the basis of classical mechanics. &#8230; It is more reasonable to suppose that the law of increase of entropy in the above general formulation arises from quantum effects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They talk about the interaction of classical and quantum systems, and what amounts to the explicit irreversibility of the traditional formalism of quantum measurement, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ost-physics-landaulifshitz-statisticalphysics/page/n42/mode/1up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>then say</a> that if quantum mechanics is in fact the ultimate source of irreversibility:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">&#8230; there must exist an inequality involving the quantum constant ℏ which ensures the validity of the law and is satisfied in the real world&#8230;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about other textbooks? <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Edward_Mayer' target=_blank rel=noopener>Joseph Mayer</a> (1904–1983) and <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Maria+Goeppert+Mayer' target=_blank rel=noopener>Maria Goeppert Mayer</a>’s (1906–1972) 1940 <em>Statistical Mechanics</em> has the rather charming</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img18.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n15/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img18.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>though in the end they sidestep difficult questions about the Second Law by basically making convenient definitions of what <em>S</em> and Ω mean in <em>S</em> = <em>k</em> log Ω.</p>\n<p>For a long time one of the most cited textbooks in the area was <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Richard+Tolman'>Richard Tolman</a>’s (1881–1948) 1938 <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/mode/2up\" target=_blank rel=noopener>Principles of Statistical Mechanics</a></em>. Tolman (basically following Gibbs) begins by explaining that statistical mechanics is about making predictions when all you know are probabilistic statements about initial conditions:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img19.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/principlesofstat0000tolm/page/n22/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img19.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Tolman continues:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img20.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n15/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img20.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>He notes that, historically, statistical mechanics was developed for studying systems like gases, where (in a vague foreshadowing of the concept of computational irreducibility) “it is evident that we should be quickly lost in the complexities of our computations” if we try to trace every molecule, but where, he claims, statistical mechanics can still accurately tell us “statistically” what will happen:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img21.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n17/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img21.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But where exactly should we get the probability distributions for initial states from? Tolman says he’s going to consider the kinds of mathematically defined ensembles that Gibbs discusses. And tucked away at the end of a chapter he admits that, well, yes, this setup is really all just a postulate—set up so as to make the results of statistical mechanics “merely a matter for computation”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img22.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n83/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img22.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>On this basis Tolman then derives Boltzmann’s <em>H</em> theorem, and his <img style=\"margin-bottom: -6px\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/sw18history1423img32.png\" width= '15' height='22'> “coarse-grained” generalization (where, yes, the coarse-graining ultimately operates according to his postulate). For 530 pages, there’s not a single mention of the Second Law. But finally, on page 558 Tolman is at least prepared to talk about an “analog of the Second Law”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img23.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/ThePrinciplesOfStatisticalMechanicsTolmanOxfordAtTheClarendonPress1938/page/n573/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img23.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>And basically what Tolman argues is that his <img style=\"margin-bottom: -6px\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/sw18history1423img32.png\" width= '15' height='22'> can reasonably be identified with thermodynamic entropy <em>S</em>.

Wanting to make use of the Second Law, but concerned about the reversibility objections, Reichenbach introduces the notion of “branch systems”—essentially parts of the universe that can eventually be considered isolated, but which were once connected to other parts that were responsible for determining their (“nonrandom”) effective initial conditions:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img27.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/directionoftimee0000reic/page/119/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img27.png\" width='403' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Most textbooks that cover the Second Law use one of the formulations that we’ve already discussed. But there is one more formulation that also sometimes appears, usually associated with the name &#8220;Carathéodory&#8221; or the term “axiomatic thermodynamics”. </p>\n<p>Back in the first decade of the twentieth century—particularly in the circle around <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hilbert/' target=_blank rel=noopener>David Hilbert</a> (1862–1943)—there was a lot of enthusiasm for axiomatizing things, including physics. And in 1908 the mathematician <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Caratheodory/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Constantin Carathéodory</a> (1873–1950) suggested an axiomatization of thermodynamics. His essential idea—that he developed further in the 1920s—was to consider something like Gibbs’s phase fluid and then roughly to assert that it gets (in some measure-theoretic sense) “so mixed up” that there aren’t “experimentally doable” transformations that can unmix it. Or, in his <a href='https://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>original formulation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4; font-size: .98rem; text-indent: 0;\">In any arbitrary neighborhood of an arbitrarily given initial point there is a state that cannot be arbitrarily approximated by adiabatic changes of state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There wasn’t much pickup of this approach—though <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Born/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Max Born</a> (1882–1970) supported it, Max Planck dismissed it, and in 1939 <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chandrasekhar/' target=_blank rel=noopener>S.

But in various forms, the approach did make it into a few textbooks. An example is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Pippard' target=_blank rel=noopener>Brian Pippard</a>’s (1920–2008) otherwise rather practical 1957 <em>The Elements of Classical Thermodynamics</em>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img28.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/elementsofclassi0000abpi_q7i4/page/30/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img28.png\" width='594' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Yet another (loosely related) approach is the “postulatory formulation” on which <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Herbert+Callen'>Herbert Callen</a>’s (1919–1993) 1959 textbook <em>Thermodynamics</em> is based:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img29.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/thermodynamicsin0000call/page/n11/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img29.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>In effect this is now “assuming the result” of the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img30.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/thermodynamicsin0000call/page/24/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img30.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Though in an appendix he rather tautologically states:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img31.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/thermodynamicsin0000call/page/317/mode/1up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img31.png\" width='574' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>So what about other textbooks? A famous set are <a href='https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Feynman/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Richard Feynman</a>’s (1918–1988) 1963 <em>Lectures on Physics</em>. Feynman starts his discussion of the Second Law quite carefully, describing it as a “hypothesis”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img32.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/444/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img32.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>Feynman says he’s not going to go very far into thermodynamics, though quotes (and criticizes) Clausius’s statements:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img33.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/452/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img33.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But then he launches into a whole chapter on “Ratchet and pawl”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img34.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/464/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img34.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>His goal, he explains, is to analyze a device (similar to what Marian Smoluchowski <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/1/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics#maxwell&rsquo;s-demon' target=_blank rel=noopener>had considered in 1912</a>) that one might think by its one-way ratchet action would be able to “harvest random heat” and violate the Second Law. But after a few pages of analysis he claims that, no, if the system is in equilibrium, thermal fluctuations will prevent systematic “one-way” mechanical work from being achieved, so that the Second Law is saved.</p>\n<p>But now he applies this to Maxwell’s demon, claiming that the same basic argument shows that the demon can’t work:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img35.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/468/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img35.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But what about reversibility? Feynman first discusses what amounts to Boltzmann&#8217;s fluctuation idea:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img36.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/472/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img36.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>But then he opts instead for the argument that for some reason—then unknown—the universe started in a “low-entropy” state, and has been “running down” ever since:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image sourced\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img37.png\" data-url=\"https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0001feyn_q2w1/page/472/mode/2up\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\"  src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12523img37.png\" width='620' height='' /></a></p>\n<p>By the beginning of the 1960s an immense number of books had appeared that discussed the Second Law. Some were based on macroscopic thermodynamics, some on kinetic theory and some on statistical mechanics. In all three of these cases there was elegant mathematical theory to be described, even if it never really addressed the ultimate origin of the Second Law. </p>\n<p>But by the early 1960s there was something new on the scene: computer simulation. And in 1965 that formed the core of <a href='https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/in-memoriam/files/frederick-reif.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>Fred Reif</a>’s (1927–2019) textbook <em>Statistical Physics</em>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img259.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img259.png\" width=\"582\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>In a sense the book is an exploration of what simulated hard sphere gases do—as analyzed using ideas from statistical mechanics. (The simulations had computational limitations, but they could go far enough to meaningfully see most of the basic phenomena of statistical mechanics.)</p>\n<p>Even the front and back covers of the book provide a bold statement of both reversibility and the kind of randomization that’s at the heart of the Second Law:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img260.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img260.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>But inside the book the formal concept of entropy doesn&#8217;t appear until page 147—where it&#8217;s defined very concretely in terms of states one can explicitly enumerate:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img261.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img261.png\" width=\"582\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>And finally, on page 283—after all necessary definitions have been built up—there’s a rather prosaic statement of the Second Law, almost as a technical footnote:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img262.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img262.png\" width=\"380\" height=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Looking though many textbooks of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics it’s striking how singular Reif’s “show-don’t-tell” computer-simulation approach is. And, as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/a-50-year-quest-my-personal-journey-with-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>I describe in detail elsewhere</a>, for me personally it has a particular significance, because this is the book that in 1972, at the age of 12, launched me on what has now been a 50-year journey to understand the Second Law and its origins. </p>\n<p>When the first textbooks that described the Second Law were published nearly a century and a half ago they often (though even then not always) expressed uncertainty about the Second Law and just how it was supposed to work. But it wasn’t long before the vast majority of books either just “assumed the Second Law” and got on with whatever they wanted to apply it to, or tried to suggest that the Second Law had been established from underlying principles, but that it was a sophisticated story that was “out of the scope of this book” but to be found elsewhere. And so it was that a strong sense emerged that the Second Law was something whose ultimate character and origins the typical working scientist didn’t need to question—and should just believe (and protect) as part of the <a href='https://archive.org/details/twoculturesscien00snow/page/16/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener>standard canon of science</a>.</p>\n<p><!--Section 18 So Where Does This Leave the Second Law?--></p>\n<h2 id='so-where-does-this-leave-the-second-law?'>So Where Does This Leave the Second Law?</h2>\n<p>The Second Law is now more than 150 years old. But—at least until now—I think it’s fair to say that the fundamental ideas used to discuss it haven’t materially changed in more than a century. There’s a lot that’s been written about the Second Law. But it’s always tended to follow lines of development already defined over a century ago—and mostly those from Clausius, or Boltzmann, or Gibbs.</p>\n<p>Looking at word clouds of titles of the thousands of publications about the Second Law over the decades we see just a few trends, like the appearance of the “generalized Second Law” in the 1990s relating to black holes:</p>\n<div class='wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above' data-c2c-file=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img260_copy.txt\" data-c2c-type='text/html'> <img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swhistory12423img263.png\" alt='' title='' width='592' height='245'> </div>\n<p>But with all this activity why hasn’t more been worked out about the Second Law? How come after all this time we still don’t really even understand with clarity the correspondence between the Clausius, Boltzmann and Gibbs approaches—or how their respective definitions of “entropy” are ultimately related? </p>\n<p>In the end, I think the answer is that it needs a new paradigm—that, yes, is fundamentally based on computation and on ideas like computational irreducibility. A little more than a century ago—with people still actively arguing about what Boltzmann was saying—I don’t think anyone would have been too surprised to find out that to make progress would need a new way of looking at things. (After all, just a few years earlier Boltzmann and Gibbs had needed to bring in the new idea of using probability theory.)</p>\n<p>But as we discussed, by the beginning of the twentieth century—with other areas of physics heating up—interest in the Second Law was waning. And even with many questions unresolved people moved on. And soon several academic generations had passed. And as is typical in the history of science, by that point nobody was questioning the foundations anymore. In the particular case of the Second Law there was some sense that the uncertainties had to do with the assumption of the existence of molecules, which had by then been established. But more important, I think, was just the passage of “academic time” and the fact that what might once have been a matter of discussion had now just become a statement in the textbooks—that future academic generations should learn and didn’t need to question.</p>\n<p>One of the unusual features of the Second Law is that at the time it passed into the “standard canon of science” it was still rife with controversy. How did those different approaches relate? What about those “mathematical objections”? What about the thought experiments that seemed to suggest exceptions? It wasn’t that these issues were resolved. It was just that after enough time had passed people came to assume that “somehow that must have all been worked out ages ago”. </p>\n<p>And it wasn’t that there was really any pressure to investigate foundational issues. The Second Law—particularly in its implications for thermal equilibrium—seemed to work just fine in all its standard applications. And it even seemed to work in new domains like black holes. Yes, there was always a desire to extend it. But the difficulties encountered in trying to do so didn’t seem in any obvious way related to issues about its foundations.</p>\n<p>Of course, there were always a few people who kept wondering about the Second Law. And indeed I’ve been surprised at how much of a <em>Who’s Who</em> of twentieth-century physics this seems to have included. But while many well-known physicists seem to have privately thought about the foundations of the Second Law they managed to make remarkably little progress—and as a result left very few visible records of their efforts.</p>\n<p>But—as is so often the case—the issue, I believe, is that a fundamentally new paradigm was needed in order to make real progress. When the “standard canon” of the Second Law was formed in the latter part of the nineteenth century, calculus was the primary tool for physics—with probability theory a newfangled addition introduced specifically for studying the Second Law. And from that time it would be many decades before even the beginnings of the computational paradigm began to emerge, and nearly a century before phenomena like computational irreducibility were finally discovered. Had the sequence been different I have no doubt that what I have now been able to understand about the Second Law would have been worked out by the likes of Boltzmann, Maxwell and Kelvin. </p>\n<p>But as it is, we’ve had to wait more than a century to get to this point. And having now studied the history of the Second Law—and seen the tangled manner in which it developed—I believe that we can now be confident that we have indeed successfully been able to resolve many of the core issues and mysteries that have plagued the Second Law and its foundations over the course of nearly 150 years.</p>\n<p><span></p>\n<p style=\"color:#c42c1f\"><em>Note</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Almost all of what I say here is based on my reading of primary literature, assisted by modern tools and by my latest understanding of the Second Law.

And it’s happening now with <a href='https://openai.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>OpenAI</a>’s <a href='https://chat.openai.com/chat' target=_blank rel=noopener>ChatGPT</a>. <span id=\"more-42458\"></span></p>\n<p>I’ve been tracking <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/core-areas/machine-learning/'>neural net technology</a> for a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/'>long time (about 43 years, actually)</a>. And even having watched developments in the past few years I find the performance of ChatGPT thoroughly remarkable. Finally, and suddenly, here’s a system that can successfully generate text about almost anything—that’s very comparable to what humans might write. It’s impressive, and useful. And, as I’ll discuss elsewhere, I think its success is probably telling us some very fundamental things about the nature of human thinking.</p>\n<p>But while ChatGPT is a remarkable achievement in automating the doing of major human-like things, not everything that’s useful to do is quite so “human like”. Some of it is instead more formal and structured. And indeed one of the great achievements of our civilization over the past several centuries has been to build up the paradigms of mathematics, the exact sciences—and, most importantly, now computation—and to create a tower of capabilities quite different from what pure human-like thinking can achieve.</p>\n<p>I myself have been deeply involved with the computational paradigm for many decades, in the singular pursuit of building a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a> to represent as many things in the world as possible in formal symbolic ways. And in doing this my goal has been to build a system that can “computationally assist”—and augment—what I and others want to do. I think about things as a human. But I can also immediately call on <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> and Wolfram|Alpha to tap into a kind of unique “computational superpower” that lets me do all sorts of beyond-human things.</p>\n<p>It’s a tremendously powerful way of working. And the point is that it’s not just important for us humans. It’s equally, if not more, important for human-like AIs as well—immediately giving them what we can think of as computational knowledge superpowers, that leverage the non-human-like power of structured computation and structured knowledge.</p>\n<p>We’ve just started exploring what this means for ChatGPT. But it’s pretty clear that wonderful things are possible. Wolfram|Alpha does something very different from ChatGPT, in a very different way. But they have a common interface: natural language. And this means that ChatGPT can “talk to” Wolfram|Alpha just like humans do—with Wolfram|Alpha turning the natural language it gets from ChatGPT into precise, symbolic computational language on which it can apply its computational knowledge power.</p>\n<p>For decades there’s been a dichotomy in thinking about AI between “statistical approaches” of the kind ChatGPT uses, and “symbolic approaches” that are in effect the starting point for Wolfram|Alpha. But now—thanks to the success of ChatGPT—as well as all the work we’ve done in making Wolfram|Alpha understand natural language—there’s finally the opportunity to combine these to make something much stronger than either could ever achieve on their own.</p>\n<h2 id='a-basic-example'>A Basic Example</h2>\n<p>At its core, ChatGPT is a system for generating linguistic output that “follows the pattern” of what’s out there on the web and in books and other materials that have been used in its training. And what’s remarkable is how human-like the output is, not just at a small scale, but across whole essays. It has coherent things to say, that pull in concepts it’s learned, quite often in interesting and unexpected ways. What it produces is always “statistically plausible”, at least at a linguistic level. But—impressive as that ends up being—it certainly doesn’t mean that all the facts and computations it confidently trots out are necessarily correct. </p>\n<p>Here’s an example I just noticed (and, yes, ChatGPT has intrinsic built-in randomness, so if you try this, you probably won’t get the same result):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img1.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"190\" /></a></p>\n<p>It sounds pretty convincing. But it turns out that it’s wrong, as Wolfram|Alpha can tell us:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=How+far+is+it+from+Chicago+to+Tokyo%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img2a.png\" alt='How far is it from Chicago to Tokyo?' title='How far is it from Chicago to Tokyo?' width='620' height='308' /></a></p>\n<p>To be fair, of course, this is exactly the kind of the thing that Wolfram|Alpha is good at: something that can be turned into a precise computation that can be done on the basis of its structured, curated knowledge. </p>\n<p>But the neat thing is that one can think about Wolfram|Alpha automatically helping ChatGPT on this. One can <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/WolframAlpha.html'>programmatically</a> ask Wolfram|Alpha the question (you can also use a <a href='https://products.wolframalpha.com/api'>web API</a>, etc.): </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img3.png\" alt='' title='' width='610' height='60' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img3a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now ask the question again to ChatGPT, appending this result:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img4.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>ChatGPT very politely takes the correction, and if you ask the question yet again it then gives the correct answer. Obviously there could be a more streamlined way to handle the back and forth with Wolfram|Alpha, but it’s nice to see that even this very straightforward pure-natural-language approach basically already works.</p>\n<p>But why does ChatGPT get this particular thing wrong in the first place? If it had seen the specific distance between Chicago and Tokyo somewhere in its training (e.g. from the web), it could of course get it right. But this is a case where the kind of generalization a neural net can readily do—say from many examples of distances between cities—won’t be enough; there’s an actual computational algorithm that’s needed. </p>\n<p>The way Wolfram|Alpha handles things is quite different. It takes natural language and then—assuming it’s possible—it converts this into precise computational language (i.e. Wolfram Language), in this case: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img5.png\" alt='' title='' width='347' height='60' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The coordinates of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/City.html'>cities</a> and algorithms to <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GeoDistance.html'>compute distances</a> between them are then part of the built-in computational knowledge in the Wolfram Language.

But in the interests of understanding where ChatGPT can take advantage of Wolfram|Alpha’s strengths, let’s discuss some cases where on its own ChatGPT doesn’t do quite the right thing. And one area where ChatGPT—like humans—often tends to struggle is math.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img6.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"248\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s an interesting, essay-style response. But the actual result is wrong:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+is+3+to+the+power+73%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img7a.png\" alt='What is 3 to the power 73?' title='What is 3 to the power 73?' width='620' height='361' /></a></p>\n<p>But if ChatGPT “consulted” Wolfram|Alpha it’d of course be able to get it right. </p>\n<p>Let’s try something slightly more complex:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img8a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img8a.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"436\" /></a></p>\n<p>At first glance, this result looks great, and I’d be inclined to believe it. It turns out, though, that it’s wrong, as Wolfram|Alpha can tell us:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=circumference+of+an+ellipse+with+half+axes+3+and+12\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img9b.png\" alt='Circumference of an ellipse with half axes 3 and 12' title='Circumference of an ellipse with half axes 3 and 12' width='620' height='259' /></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, doing math homework with ChatGPT (without it being able to consult Wolfram|Alpha) is probably a bad idea. It can give you a very plausible answer:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img10.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img10.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"364\" /></a></p>\n<p>But without “really understanding the math” it’s basically impossible for ChatGPT to reliably get the right answer. And in this case, the answer is again wrong:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+is+the+integral+of+x%5E2+cos%282x%29\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img11a.png\" alt='What is the integral of x^2 cos(2x)' title='What is the integral of x^2 cos(2x)' width='620' height='340' /></a></p>\n<p>Still, ChatGPT can even make up a very plausible-looking explanation of “how it got its answer” (not that it’s in any way how it really “did it”). And, rather charmingly (and interestingly), the explanation it gives has mistakes very similar to what a human who didn’t understand the math might also make:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img12.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img12.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"594\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are all sorts of situations where “not really understanding what things mean” can cause trouble: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img13.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img13.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"215\" /></a></p>\n<p>That sounds convincing. But it’s not correct:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+are+the+largest+countries+in+Central+America%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img14a.png\" alt='What are the largest countries in Central America?' title='What are the largest countries in Central America?' width='620' height='480' /></a></p>\n<p>ChatGPT seemed to have correctly learned this underlying data somewhere—but it doesn’t “understand what it means” enough to be able to correctly rank the numbers:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img15.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"353\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, one can imagine finding a way to “fix this particular bug”. But the point is that the fundamental idea of a generative-language-based AI system like ChatGPT just isn’t a good fit in situations where there are structured computational things to do. Put another way, it’d take “fixing” an almost infinite number of “bugs” to patch up what even an almost-infinitesimal corner of Wolfram|Alpha can achieve in its structured way.</p>\n<p>And the more complex the “computational chain” gets, the more likely you’ll have to call on Wolfram|Alpha to get it right. Here ChatGPT produces a rather confused answer:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img16.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"236\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, as Wolfram|Alpha tells us, its conclusion isn’t correct (as it already in a sense “knew”):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+planetary+moons+are+larger+than+Mercury%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img17a.png\" alt='What planetary moons are larger than Mercury' title='What planetary moons are larger than Mercury?' width='620' height='353' /></a></p>\n<p>Whenever it comes to specific (e.g. quantitative) data—even in fairly raw form—things very often tend to have to be more of a “Wolfram|Alpha story”. Here’s an example, inspired by a longtime favorite Wolfram|Alpha test query “How many turkeys are there in Turkey?”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img18.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>Again, this seems (at first) totally plausible, and it’s even quoting a relevant source. Turns out, though, that this data is basically just “made up”:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Livestock+populations+in+Turkey\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img19a.png\" alt='Livestock populations in Turkey' title='Livestock populations in Turkey' width='620' height='361' /></a></p>\n<p>Still, what’s very nice is that ChatGPT can easily be made to “ask for facts to check”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img20.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"228\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now feed these through the Wolfram|Alpha API:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img21a.png\" alt='' title='' width='505' height='302' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img21a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now we can ask ChatGPT to fix its original response, injecting this data (and even showing in bold where it did it):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img22.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"479\" /></a></p>\n<p>The ability to “inject facts” is particularly nice when it comes to things involving real-time (or location etc. dependent) data or computation.

Here’s a rather whimsical question asked of Wolfram|Alpha (and it even checks if you want “soft-serve” instead): </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=How+many+calories+are+there+in+a+cubic+light+year+of+ice+cream%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img26a.png\" alt='How many calories are there in a cubic light year of ice cream?' title='How many calories are there in a cubic light year of ice cream?' width='620' height='419' /></a></p>\n<p>ChatGPT at first gets a bit confused about the concept of volume:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img27.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img27.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"171\" /></a></p>\n<p>But then it seems to “realize” that that much ice cream is fairly silly:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img28.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img28.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"269\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id='the-path-forward'>The Path Forward</h2>\n<p>Machine learning is a powerful method, and particularly over the past decade, it’s had some remarkable successes—of which ChatGPT is the latest. <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageIdentify.html'>Image recognition</a>. <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SpeechRecognize.html'>Speech to text</a>. <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TextTranslation.html'>Language translation</a>. In each of these cases, and many more, a threshold was passed—usually quite suddenly. And some task went from “basically impossible” to “basically doable”.</p>\n<p>But the results are essentially never “perfect”. Maybe something works well 95% of the time. But try as one might, the other 5% remains elusive. For some purposes one might consider this a failure. But the key point is that there are often all sorts of important use cases for which 95% is “good enough”. Maybe it’s because the output is something where there isn’t really a “right answer” anyway. Maybe it’s because one’s just trying to surface possibilities that a human—or a systematic algorithm—will then pick from or refine. </p>\n<p>It’s completely remarkable that a few-hundred-billion-parameter neural net that generates text a token at a time can do the kinds of things ChatGPT can. And given this dramatic—and unexpected—success, one might think that if one could just go on and “train a big enough network” one would be able to do absolutely anything with it. But it won’t work that way. Fundamental facts about computation—and notably the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>—make it clear it ultimately can’t. But what’s more relevant is what we’ve seen in the actual history of machine learning. There’ll be a big breakthrough (like ChatGPT). And improvement won’t stop. But what’s much more important is that there’ll be use cases found that are successful with what can be done, and that aren’t blocked by what can’t.</p>\n<p>And yes, there’ll be plenty of cases where “raw ChatGPT” can help with people’s writing, make suggestions, or generate text that’s useful for various kinds of documents or interactions. But when it comes to setting up things that have to be perfect, machine learning just isn’t the way to do it—much as humans aren’t either.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what we’re seeing in the examples above. ChatGPT does great at the “human-like parts”, where there isn’t a precise “right answer”. But when it’s “put on the spot” for something precise, it often falls down. But the whole point here is that there’s a great way to solve this problem—by connecting ChatGPT to Wolfram|Alpha and all its computational knowledge “superpowers”. </p>\n<p>Inside Wolfram|Alpha, everything is being turned into computational language, and into precise Wolfram Language code, that at some level has to be “perfect” to be reliably useful. But the crucial point is that ChatGPT doesn’t have to generate this. It can produce its usual natural language, and then Wolfram|Alpha can use its natural language understanding capabilities to translate that natural language into precise Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>In many ways, one might say that ChatGPT never “truly understands” things; it just “knows how to produce stuff that’s useful”. But it’s a different story with Wolfram|Alpha. Because once Wolfram|Alpha has converted something to Wolfram Language, what it’s got is a complete, precise, formal representation, from which one can reliably compute things. Needless to say, there are plenty of things of “human interest” for which we don’t have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>formal computational representations</a>—though we can still talk about them, albeit it perhaps imprecisely, in natural language. And for these, ChatGPT is on its own, with its very impressive capabilities.</p>\n<p>But just like us humans, there are times when ChatGPT needs a more formal and precise “power assist”. But the point is that it doesn’t have to be “formal and precise” in saying what it wants. Because Wolfram|Alpha can communicate with it in what amounts to ChatGPT’s native language—natural language. And Wolfram|Alpha will take care of “adding the formality and precision” when it converts to its native language—Wolfram Language. It’s a very good situation, that I think has great practical potential.</p>\n<p>And that potential is not only at the level of typical chatbot or text generation applications. It extends to things like doing data science or other forms of computational work (or programming). In a sense, it’s an immediate way to get the best of both worlds: the human-like world of ChatGPT, and the computationally precise world of Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>What about ChatGPT directly learning Wolfram Language? Well, yes, it could do that, and in fact it’s already started. And in the end I fully expect that something like ChatGPT will be able to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/'>operate directly in Wolfram Language</a>, and be very powerful in doing so. It’s an interesting and unique situation, made possible by the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>character of the Wolfram Language as a full-scale computational language</a> that can talk broadly about things in the world and elsewhere in computational terms.</p>\n<p>The whole concept of the Wolfram Language is to take things we humans think about, and be able to represent and work with them computationally. Ordinary programming languages are intended to provide ways to tell computers specifically what to do. The Wolfram Language—in its role as a full-scale computational language—is about something much larger than that. In effect, it’s intended to be a language in which both humans and computers can “think computationally”.</p>\n<p>Many centuries ago, when mathematical notation was invented, it provided for the first time a streamlined medium in which to “think mathematically” about things. And its invention soon led to algebra, and calculus, and ultimately all the various mathematical sciences. The goal of the Wolfram Language is to do something similar for computational thinking, though now not just for humans—and to enable all the “computational X” fields that can be opened up by the computational paradigm.</p>\n<p>I myself have benefitted greatly from having Wolfram Language as a “language to think in”, and it’s been wonderful to see over the past few decades so many advances being made as a result of people “thinking in computational terms” through the medium of Wolfram Language. So what about ChatGPT? Well, it can get into this too. Quite how it will all work I am not yet sure. But it’s not about ChatGPT learning how to do the computation that the Wolfram Language already knows how to do. It’s about ChatGPT learning how to use the Wolfram Language more like people do. It’s about ChatGPT coming up with the analog of “creative essays”, but now written not in natural language but in computational language. </p>\n<p>I’ve long discussed the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/'>concept of computational essays</a> written by humans—that communicate in a mixture of natural language and computational language. Now it’s a question of ChatGPT being able to write those—and being able to use Wolfram Language as a way to deliver “meaningful communication”, not just to humans, but also to computers. And, yes, there’s a potentially interesting feedback loop involving actual execution of the Wolfram Language code. But the crucial point is that the richness and flow of “ideas” represented by the Wolfram Language code is—unlike in an ordinary programming language—something much closer to the kind of thing that ChatGPT has “magically” managed to work with in natural language.</p>\n<p>Or, put another way, Wolfram Language—like natural language&#8211;is something expressive enough that one can imagine writing a meaningful “prompt” for ChatGPT in it. Yes, Wolfram Language can be directly executed on a computer. But as a ChatGPT prompt it can be used to “express an idea” whose “story” could be continued. It might describe some computational structure, leaving ChatGPT to “riff” on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>what one might computationally say</a> about that structure that would—according to what it’s learned by reading so many things written by humans—be “interesting to humans”. </p>\n<p>There are all sorts of exciting possibilities, suddenly opened up by the unexpected success of ChatGPT. But for now there’s the immediate opportunity of giving ChatGPT computational knowledge superpowers through Wolfram|Alpha. So it can not just produce “plausible human-like output”, but output that leverages the whole tower of computation and knowledge that’s encapsulated in Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Language. </p>\n",

We continue to have a huge pipeline of R&#038;D, some short term, some medium term, some long term (like decade-plus).

But it’s also got some “surprise” new dramatic efficiency improvements, and it’s got some first hints of major new areas that we have under development—particularly related to astronomy and celestial mechanics.</p>\n<p>But even though I’m calling it a “small release”, Version 13.2 still introduces completely new functions into the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>, 41 of them—as well as substantially enhancing 64 existing functions. And, as usual, we’ve put a lot of effort into coherently designing those functions, so they fit into the tightly integrated framework we’ve been building for the past 35 years. For the past several years we’ve been following the principle of open code development (does anyone else do this yet?)—opening up our core software design meetings as livestreams. During the Version 13.2 cycle we’ve done about 61 hours of design livestreams—getting all sorts of great real-time feedback from the community (thanks, everyone!). And, yes, we’re holding steady at an overall average of one hour of livestreamed design time per new function, and a little less than half that per enhanced function.</p>\n<p>\t<a href=\"https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/\"><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw01delivering_liveceoimg1.png\" alt='Live CEOing livestreams' title='Live CEOing livestreams' width='591' height='456'/></a></p>\n<p><!--Section 02 Astro Computation--></p>\n<h2 id='introducing-astro-computation'>Introducing Astro Computation</h2>\n<p>Astronomy has been a driving force for computation for more than 2000 years (from the Antikythera device on)&#8230; and in Version 13.2 it’s coming to Wolfram Language in a big way. Yes, the Wolfram Language (and <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>) have had astronomical data for well over a decade. But what’s new now is astronomical computation fully integrated into the system. In many ways, our astro computation capabilities are modeled on our geo computation ones. But astro is substantially more complicated. Mountains don’t move (at least perceptibly), but planets certainly do. Relativity also isn’t important in geography, but it is in astronomy. And on the Earth, latitude and longitude are good standard ways to describe where things are. But in astronomy—especially with everything moving—describing where things are is much more complicated. Oh, and there’s the question of where things “are,” versus where things appear to be—because of effects ranging from light-propagation delays to refraction in the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The key function for representing where astronomical things are is <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AstroPosition.html\"><tt>AstroPosition</tt></a>. Here’s where Mars is now:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw02astrocomp121222img1.png\" alt='' title='' width='341' height='90' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw02astrocomp121222img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sw02astrocomp121222img1'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sw02astrocomp121222img1_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>What does that output mean? It’s very “here and now” oriented. By default, it’s telling me the azimuth (angle from north) and altitude (angle above the horizon) for Mars from where <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Here.html'>Here</a></tt> says I am, at the time specified by <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Now.html'>Now</a></tt>. How can I get a less “personal” representation of “where Mars is”?

(One direction is defined by the rotation axis of the Earth, the other by where the Sun is at the time of the spring equinox.)

In physics textbooks, it’s traditional to carefully distinguish absolute temperatures, measured in kelvins, from temperature scales, like degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. And that’s important, because while absolute temperatures can be added, subtracted, multiplied etc. just like other units, temperature scales on their own cannot. (Multiplying by 0° C to get 0 for something like an amount of heat would be very wrong.) On the other hand, differences in temperature—even measured in Celsius—can be multiplied. How can all this be untangled?</p>\n<p>In previous versions we had a whole different kind of unit (or, more precisely, different physical quantity dimension) for temperature differences (much as mass and time have different dimensions). But now we’ve got a better solution. We’ve basically introduced new units—but still “temperature-dimensioned” ones—that represent temperature differences. And we’ve introduced a new notation (a little Δ subscript) to indicate them:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img8.png\" alt='' title='' width='341' height='57' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img8a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='dtu8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='dtu8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you take a difference between two temperatures, the result will have temperature-difference units:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img9.png\" alt='' title='' width='132' height='57' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='dtu9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='dtu9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But if you convert this to an absolute temperature, it’ll just be in ordinary temperature units:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img10.png\" alt='' title='' width='220' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img10a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='dtu10_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='dtu10_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And with this unscrambled, it’s actually possible to do arbitrary arithmetic even on temperatures measured on any temperature scale—though the results also come back as absolute temperatures:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img11.png\" alt='' title='' width='106' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img11_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='dtu11_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='dtu11_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s worth understanding that an absolute temperature can be converted either to a temperature scale value, or a temperature scale difference:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img12.png\" alt='' title='' width='612' height='66' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img12_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='dtu12_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='dtu12_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All of this means that you can now use temperatures on any scale in formulas, and they’ll just work:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img13.png\" alt='' title='' width='201' height='57' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw03datestimesunits121222img13_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='dtu13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='dtu13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><!--Section 5 Polynomial Operations--></p>\n<h2 id='dramatically-faster-polynomial-operations'>Dramatically Faster Polynomial Operations</h2>\n<p>Almost any algebraic computation ends up somehow involving polynomials.

In other words, the process of evaluation would always go on until a fixed point was reached. “But what happens if <em>x</em> doesn’t have a value, and you say <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1?” people would ask. “Won’t the system blow up in that case?” Well, in some sense yes. But I took a calculated gamble that the benefits of infinite evaluation for ordinary computations that people actually want to do would vastly outweigh any possible issues with what seemed like “pointless corner cases” such as <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1. Well, 43 years later I think I can say with some confidence that that gamble worked out. The concept of infinite evaluation—combined with the symbolic structure of the Wolfram Language—has been a source of tremendous power, and most users simply never run into, and never have to think about, the <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1 “corner case”.</p>\n<p>However, if you type <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1 the system clearly has to do something. And in a sense the purest thing to do would just be to continue computing forever. But 34 years ago that led to a rather disastrous problem on actual computers—and in fact still does today. Because in general this kind of repeated evaluation is a recursive process, that ultimately has to be implemented using the call stack set up for every instance of a program by the operating system. But the way operating systems work (still!) is to allocate only a fixed amount of memory for the stack—and if this is overrun, the operating system will simply make your program crash (or, in earlier times, the operating system itself might crash). And this meant that ever since Version 1, we’ve needed to have a limit in place on infinite evaluation. In early versions we tried to give the “result of the computation so far”, wrapped in <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Hold.html'>Hold</a></tt>. Back in Version 10, we started just returning a held version of the original expression:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img6.png\" alt='' title='' width='463' height='80' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img6a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='rc6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='rc6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But even this is in a sense not safe. Because with other infinite definitions in place, one can end up with a situation where even trying to return the held form triggers additional infinite computational processes.</p>\n<p>In recent times, particularly with our exploration of multicomputation, we’ve decided to revisit the question of how to limit infinite computations. At some theoretical level, one might imagine explicitly representing infinite computations using things like transfinite numbers. But that’s fraught with difficulty, and manifest undecidability (“Is this infinite computation output really the same as that one?”, etc.) But in Version 13.2, as the beginning of a new, “purely symbolic” approach to “runaway computation” we’re introducing the construct <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TerminatedEvaluation.html'>TerminatedEvaluation</a></tt>—that just symbolically represents, as it says, a terminated computation.</p>\n<p>So here’s what now happens with <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img8.png\" alt='' title='' width='323' height='80' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img8a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='rc8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='rc8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A notable feature of this is that it’s “independently encapsulated”: the termination of one part of a computation doesn’t affect others, so that, for example, we get:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img9.png\" alt='' title='' width='609' height='118' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img9a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='rc9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='rc9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>There’s a complicated relation between terminated evaluations and lazy evaluation, and we’re working on some interesting and potentially powerful new capabilities in this area.

Once an abort has been generated—either directly by using <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Abort.html'>Abort</a>[ ]</tt>, or as the result of something like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TimeConstrained.html'>TimeConstrained</a>[ ]</tt> or <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MemoryConstrained.html'>MemoryConstrained</a>[ ]</tt>—there’s a question of how far that abort should propagate. By default, it’ll propagate all the way up, so your whole computation will end up being aborted. But ever since Version 2 (in 1991) we’ve had the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CheckAbort.html'>CheckAbort</a></tt>, which checks for aborts in the expression it’s given, then stops further propagation of the abort.</p>\n<p>But there was always a lot of trickiness around the question of things like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TimeConstrained.html'>TimeConstrained</a>[ ]</tt>. Should aborts generated by these be propagated the same way as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Abort.html'>Abort</a>[ ]</tt> aborts or not? In Version 13.2 we’ve now cleaned all of this up, with an explicit option <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PropagateAborts.html'>PropagateAborts</a></tt> for <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CheckAbort.html'>CheckAbort</a></tt>.

These days we often prototype such functions in the <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/'>Wolfram Function Repository</a>, then further streamline their design, and eventually implement them in the permanent core Wolfram Language. In Version 13.2 just two new basic list-manipulation functions came out of this process: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PositionLargest.html'>PositionLargest</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PositionSmallest.html'>PositionSmallest</a></tt>. </p>\n<p>We’ve had the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Position.html'>Position</a></tt> since Version 1, as well as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Max.html'>Max</a></tt>. But something I’ve often found myself needing to do over the years is to combine these to answer the question: “Where is the max of that list?” Of course it’s not hard to do this in the Wolfram Language—<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Position.html'>Position</a>[list, <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Max.html'>Max</a>[list]]</tt> basically does it. But there are some edge cases and extensions to think about, and it’s convenient just to have one function to do this. And, what’s more, now that we have functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TakeLargest.html'>TakeLargest</a></tt>, there’s an obvious, consistent name for the function: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PositionLargest.html'>PositionLargest</a></tt>.

This is a question we’ve been working on for years, gradually inventing more and more mechanisms and solutions. In Version 13.2 we’ve made some small tweaks to a mechanism that’s actually been in the system for many years, but the changes we’ve made have a substantial effect on the experience of typing code.</p>\n<p>One of the big challenges is that code is typed “linearly”—essentially (apart from 2D constructs) from left to right. But (just like in natural languages like English) the meaning is defined by a more hierarchical tree structure. And one of the issues is to know how something you typed fits into the tree structure.</p>\n<p>Something like this is visually obvious quite locally in the “linear” code you typed. But sometimes what defines the tree structure is quite far away. For example, you might have a function with several arguments that are each large expressions. And when you’re looking at one of the arguments it may not be obvious what the overall function is. And part of what we’re now emphasizing more strongly in Version 13.2 is dynamic highlighting that shows you “what function you’re in”.</p>\n<p>It’s highlighting that appears when you click. So, for example, this is the highlighting you get clicking at several different positions in a simple expression:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img2.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='126' height='126' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here’s an example “from the wild” showing you that if you type at the position of the cursor, you’ll be adding an argument to the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ContourPlot.html'>ContourPlot</a></tt> function:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img4.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='533' height='121' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But now let’s click in a different place:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img6.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='533' height='121' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here’s a smaller example:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img8.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='111' height='25' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><!--Section 15 User Interface Conveniences--></p>\n<h2 id='user-interface-conveniences'>User Interface Conveniences</h2>\n<p>We first introduced the notebook interface in Version 1 back in 1988.

But it’ll always be able to get further if the user gives it some hints. For example, if <tt>x</tt> is a 64-bit integer, what type should be assumed for <em>x<sup>x</sup></em>? There are certainly values of <tt>x</tt> for which <em>x<sup>x</sup></em> won’t fit in a 64-bit integer. But the user might know those won’t show up. And so they can give a type hint that says that the <em>x<sup>x</sup></em> should be assumed to fit in a 64-bit integer, and this will allow the compiler to do much more with it.</p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that there are always going to be limitations to type inferencing, because, in a sense, inferring types requires proving theorems, and there can be theorems that have arbitrarily long proofs, or no proofs at all in a certain axiomatic system. For example, imagine asking whether the type of a zero of the Riemann zeta function has a certain imaginary part. To answer this, the type inferencer would have to solve the Riemann hypothesis. But if the user just wanted to assume the Riemann hypothesis, they could—at least in principle—use <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TypeHint.html\">TypeHint</a></tt>.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TypeHint.html'>TypeHint</a></tt> is a wrapper that means something to the compiler, but “evaporates” in ordinary evaluation. Version 13.2 adds <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/IfCompiled.html'>IfCompiled</a></tt>, which lets you explicitly delineate code that should be used with the compiler, and code that should be used in ordinary evaluation.

It also sets up everything you need to be able to write compilable code that calls the same functions as you can within the built library.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that with all the new functionality in Version 13.2 it&#8217;s become dramatically easier to integrate compiled code, external libraries etc. and to make them conveniently distributable. It&#8217;s a fairly remarkable simplification of what was previously a time-consuming and complex software engineering challenge.

href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/10/celebrating-a-third-of-a-century-of-mathematica-and-looking-forward/'>34 years since the original launch of Mathematica</a> and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. And through all those years we’ve energetically continued building further and further, adding ever more capabilities, and steadily extending the domain of the computational paradigm.</p>\n<p>In recent years we’ve established something of a rhythm, delivering the fruits of our development efforts roughly twice a year. We released <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-13/'>Version 13.0</a> on December 13, 2021. And now, roughly six months later, we’re releasing Version 13.1. As usual, even though it’s a “.1” release, it’s got a lot of new (and updated) functionality, some of which we’ve worked on for many years but finally now brought to fruition.<span id=\"more-38521\"></span></p>\n<p>For me it’s always exciting to see what we manage to deliver in each new version. And in Version 13.1 we have 90 completely new functions—as well as 203 existing functions with substantial updates. And beyond what appears in specific functions, there’s also major new functionality in Version 13.1 in areas like user interfaces and the compiler.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language as it exists today encompasses a vast range of functionality. But its great power comes not just from what it contains, but also from how coherently everything in it fits together. And for nearly 36 years I’ve taken it as a personal responsibility to ensure that that coherence is maintained. It’s taken both great focus and lots of deep intellectual work. But as I experience them every day in my use of the Wolfram Language, I’m proud of the results.</p>\n<p>And for the past four years I’ve been sharing the “behind the scenes” of how it’s achieved—by <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>livestreaming our Wolfram Language design review meetings</a>. It’s an unprecedented level of openness—and engagement with the community. In designing Version 13.1 we’ve done 90 livestreams—lasting more than 96 hours. And in opening up our process we’re providing visibility not only into what was built for Version 13.1, but also of why it was built, and how decisions about it were made. </p>\n<p>But, OK, so what finally is in Version 13.1? Let’s talk about some highlights&#8230;.</p>\n<h2 id='beyond-listability:-introducing-threaded'>Beyond Listability: Introducing Threaded</h2>\n<p>From the very beginning of Mathematica and the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> we’ve had the concept of listability: if you add two lists, for example, their corresponding elements will be added:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityAimg1.png\" alt='{a, b, c} + {x, y, z}' title='{a, b, c} + {x, y, z}' width='156' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityimg1A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='bl1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='bl1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s a very convenient mechanism, that typically does exactly what you’d want. And for 35 years we haven’t really considered extending it. But if we look at code that gets written, it often happens that there are parts that basically implement something very much like listability, but slightly more general. And in <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SummaryOfNewFeaturesIn131.html'>Version 13.1</a> we have a new symbolic construct, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Threaded.html'>Threaded</a></tt>, that effectively allows you to easily generalize listability.</p>\n<p>Consider:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityAimg2.png\" alt='{{1, 2}, {3, 4}} + {x, y}' title='{{1, 2}, {3, 4}} + {x, y}' width='208' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityimg2A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='bl2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='bl2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This uses ordinary listability, effectively computing:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityAimg3.png\" alt='{{1, 2} + x, {3, 4} + y}' title='{{1, 2} + x, {3, 4} + y}' width='208' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityimg3A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='bl3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='bl3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But what if you want instead to “go down a level” and thread <tt>{x,y}</tt> into the lowest parts of the first list?

But we never added a separate function to correspond to <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MapApply.html'>@@@</a></tt>.

Why is such a construct needed? Well, there are always tradeoffs in language design. And back in Version 1.0 we decided to make <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt> work with any number of arguments (so you can test whether a whole sequence of things are the same). But this means that for consistency <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt><tt>[expr]</tt> must always return <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html'>True</a></tt>—so it’s not available as an operator of <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt>. And that’s why now in Version 13.1 we’re adding <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameAs.html'>SameAs</a></tt>, that joins the family of operator-form functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EqualTo.html'>EqualTo</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GreaterThan.html'>GreaterThan</a></tt>:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmoreAimg7.png\" alt='SameAs' title='SameAs' width='332' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmorelamguageimg7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='yml7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='yml7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Procedural programming—often with “variables hanging out”—isn’t the preferred style for most Wolfram Language code. But sometimes it’s the most convenient way to do things. And in Version 13.1 we’ve add a small piece of streamlining by introducing the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Until.html'>Until</a></tt>. Ever since Version 1.0 we’ve had <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/While.html'>While</a></tt><tt>[test,body]</tt> which repeatedly evaluates <tt>body</tt> while <tt>test</tt> is <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html'>True</a></tt>.

So if <tt>test</tt> isn’t <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html'>True</a></tt> at first, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Until.html'>Until</a></tt> will still evaluate <tt>body</tt> once, in effect only looking at the test after it’s evaluated the body. </p>\n<p>Last but not least in the list of new core language functions in Version 13.1 is <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAt.html'>ReplaceAt</a></tt>. <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Replace.html'>Replace</a></tt> attempts to apply a replacement rule to a complete expression—or a whole level in an expression. <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAll.html'>ReplaceAll</a></tt> (<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAll.html'>/.</a></tt><tt>)</tt> does the same thing for all subparts of an expression.

And More Multilingual Support</h2>\n<p>What is a character? <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>Back when Version 1.0 was released</a>, characters were represented as 8-bit objects: usually ASCII, but you could pick another “character encoding” (hence the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CharacterEncoding.html'>ChararacterEncoding</a></tt> option) if you wanted. Then in the early 1990s came Unicode—which we were one of the very first companies to support. Now “characters” could be 16-bit constructs, with nearly 65,536 possible “glyphs” allocated across different languages and uses (including some mathematical symbols that we introduced). Back in the early 1990s Unicode was a newfangled thing, that operating systems didn’t yet have built-in support for. But we were betting on Unicode, and so we built our own infrastructure for handling it.</p>\n<p>Thirty years later Unicode is indeed the universal standard for representing character-like things. But somewhere along the way, it turned out the world needed more than 16 bits’ worth of character-like things. At first it was about supporting variants and historical writing systems (think: cuneiform or Linear B). But then came emoji. And it became clear that—yes, arguably in a return to the Egyptian hieroglyph style of communication—there was an almost infinite number of possible pictorial emoji that could be made, each of them being encoded as their own Unicode code point. </p>\n<p>It’s been a slow expansion. Original 16-bit Unicode is “plane 0”. Now there are up to 16 additional planes. Not quite 32-bit characters, but given the way computers work, the approach now is to allow characters to be represented by 32-bit objects. It’s far from trivial to do that uniformly and efficiently. And for us it’s been a long process to upgrade everything in our system—from string manipulation to notebook rendering—to handle full 32-bit characters. And that’s finally been achieved in Version 13.1.</p>\n<p>But that’s far from all. In English we’re pretty much used to being able to treat text as a sequence of letters and other characters, with each character being separate. Things get a bit more complicated when you start to worry about diphthongs like æ. But if there are fairly few of these, it works to just introduce them as individual “Unicode characters” with their own code point. But there are plenty of languages—like Hindi or Khmer—where what appears in text like an individual character is really a composite of letter-like constructs, diacritical marks and other things. Such composite characters are normally represented as “grapheme clusters”: runs of Unicode code points. The rules for handling these things can be quite complicated. But after many years of development, major operating systems now successfully do it in most cases. And in Version 13.1 we’re able to make use of this to support such constructs in notebooks.</p>\n<p>OK, so what does 32-bit Unicode look like?

But gradually there have started to be more and more high-profile operations that are conveniently done by “pressing a button”. And rather than expecting people to remember all those special key sequences (or think to look in menus for them) we’ve decided to introduce a toolbar that will be displayed by default in every standard notebook. Version 13.1 has the first iteration of this toolbar. Subsequent versions will support an increasing range of capabilities.</p>\n<p>It’s not been easy to design the default toolbar (and we hope you’ll like what we came up with!) The main problem is that Wolfram Notebooks are very general, and there are a great many things you can do with them—which it’s challenging to organize into a manageable toolbar. (Some special types of notebooks have had their own specialized toolbars for a while, which were easier to design by virtue of their specialization.) </p>\n<p>So what’s in the toolbar? On the left are a couple of evaluation controls:</p>\n<p><span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarAimg2.png\" alt='Evaluation menu options' title='Evaluation menu options' width= '231' height='230' align='absmiddle'></span></p>\n<p><span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg3.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '25' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span> means “Evaluate”, and is simply equivalent to pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>ret</kbd></span> (as its tooltip says). <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg4.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '26' height='26' align='absmiddle'></span>means “Abort”, and will stop a computation. To the right of <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg5.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '25' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span> is the menu shown above. The first part of the menu allows you to choose what will be evaluated. (Don’t forget the extremely useful “Evaluate In Place” that lets you evaluate whatever code you have selected—say to turn <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RGBColor.html'>RGBColor</a></tt><tt>[1,0,0]</tt> in your input into <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822redbox.png\" width='15' height='15' />.) The bottom part of the menu gives a couple of more detailed (but highly useful) evaluation controls.</p>\n<p>Moving along the toolbar, we next have:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg6.png\" alt='Menu option' title='Menu option' width='159' height='28' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='tb6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='tb6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If your cursor isn’t already in a cell, the pulldown allows you to select what type of cell you want to insert (it’s similar to the <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg7.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '64' height='27' align='absmiddle'></span> “tongue” that appears within the notebook). (If your cursor is already inside a cell, then like in a typical word processor, the pulldown will tell you the style that’s being used, and let you reset it.)</p>\n<p><span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg8.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '26' height='26' align='absmiddle'></span> gives you a little panel to control to appearance of cells, changing their background colors, frames, dingbats, etc.</p>\n<p>Next come cell-related buttons: <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg9.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '90' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span>.

Expect more features in later versions. One thing that’s notable about the toolbar in general is that it’s 100% implemented in Wolfram Language. And in addition to adding a great deal of flexibility, this also means that the toolbar immediately works on all platforms. (By the way, if you don’t want the toolbar in a particular notebook—or for all your notebooks—just right-click the background of the toolbar to pick that option.)</p>\n<h2 id='polishing-the-user-interface'>Polishing the User Interface</h2>\n<p>We first introduced Wolfram Notebooks with Version 1.0 of Mathematica, in 1988. And ever since then, we’ve been progressively polishing the notebook interface, doing more with every new version. </p>\n<p>The <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>=</kbd></span> mechanism for entering natural language (“<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>-style”) input debuted in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/07/launching-mathematica-10-with-700-new-functions-and-a-crazy-amount-of-rd/'>Version 10.0</a>—and in Version 13.1 it’s now accessible from the <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg1.png\" alt='picture' width= '26' height='26' align='absmiddle'></span> button in the new default notebook toolbar. But what actually is <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg2A.png\" alt='picture' width= '35' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> when it’s in a notebook? In the past, it’s been a fairly complex symbolic structure mainly suitable for evaluation. But in Version 13.1 we’ve made it much simpler. And while that doesn’t have any direct effect if you’re just using <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg2A.png\" alt='picture' width= '35' height='' align='absmiddle'></span> purely in a notebook, it does have an effect if you copy <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg2A.png\" alt='picture' width= '35' height='' align='absmiddle'></span> into another application, like pure-text email. In the past this produced something that would work if pasted back into a notebook, but definitely wasn’t particularly readable. In Version 13.1, it’s now simply the Wolfram Language interpretation of your natural language input:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg5.png\" alt='Natural language input' title='Natural language input' width='455' height='69' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>What happens if the computation you do in a notebook generates a huge output? Ever since <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v6/guide/Mathematica.html'>Version 6.0</a> we’ve had some form of “output limiter”, but in Version 13.1 it’s become much sleeker and more useful. Here’s a typical example: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 6px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg6A.png\" alt='Range' title='Range' width='120' height='' /><br />\n<img style=\"margin-top: 10px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg6B.png\" alt='Range' title='Range' width='595' height='' />\n</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Talking of big outputs (as well as other things that keep the notebook interface busy), another change in Version 13.1 is the new asynchronous progress overlay on macOS. This doesn’t affect other platforms where this problem had already been solved, but on the Mac changes in the OS had led to a situation where the notebook front end could mysteriously pop to the front on your desktop—a situation that has now been resolved.</p>\n<p>One of the slightly unusual user interface features that’s existed ever since Version 1.0 is the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Why the Beep?</span> menu item—that lets you get an explanation of any “error beep” that occurs while you’re running the system. The function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Beep.html'>Beep</a></tt> lets you generate your own beep. And now in Version 13.1 you can use <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Beep.html'>Beep</a></tt><tt>[\"string\"]</tt> to set up an explanation of “your beep”, that users can retrieve through the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Why the Beep?</span> menu item.</p>\n<p>The basic notebook user interface works as much as possible with standard interface elements on all platforms, so that when these elements are updated, we always automatically get the “most modern” look. But there are parts of the notebook interface that are quite special to Wolfram Notebooks and are always custom designed. One that hadn’t been updated for a while is the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Preferences</span> dialog—which now in Version 13.1 gets a full makeover:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg8.png\" alt='Preferences' title='Preferences' width='575' height='426' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When you tell the Wolfram Language to do something, it normally just goes off and does it, without asking you anything (well, unless it explicitly needs input, needs a password, etc.) But what if there’s something that it might be a good idea to do, though it’s not strictly necessary? What should the user interface for this be? It’s tricky, but I think we now have a good solution that we’ve started deploying in Version 13.1.</p>\n<p>In particular, in Version 13.1, there’s an example related to the <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository'>Wolfram Function Repository</a>. Say you use a function for which an update is available. What now happens is that a blue box is generated that tells you about the update—though it still keeps going with the computation, ignoring the update:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg9B.png\" alt='Update option' title='Update option' width='540' height='' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you click the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Update Now</span> button in the blue box you can do the update. And then the point is that you can run the computation again (for example, just by pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd></span>), and now it’ll use the update. In a sense the core idea is to have an interface where there are potentially multiple passes, and where a computation always runs to completion, but you have an easy way to change how it’s set up, and then run it again.</p>\n<h2 id='large-scale-code-editing'>Large-Scale Code Editing</h2>\n<p>One of the great things about the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> is that it works well for programs of any scale—from less than a line long to millions of lines long.

Using LSP (Language Server Protocol) we’ve provided the capability for most standard external IDEs to automatically do syntax coloring and other customizations for the Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>In Version 13.1 we’re also adding a couple of features that make large-scale code editing in notebooks more convenient.

The issue is not so much the algorithm for generating the cells as it is how the cells can be represented in such a way that they’re useful for subsequent computations. In the 2D case each cell is just a polygon.</p>\n<p>But in the 3D case the cells are polyhedra, and to make a Voronoi mesh we have to have a polyhedral mesh where all the polyhedra fit together. And it’s taken us many years to build the large tower of computational geometry necessary to support this. There’s a somewhat simpler case based purely on cells that are always either simplices or hexahedra—that we’ve used for finite-element solutions to PDEs for a while.

What it fundamentally does is to take a Wolfram Language integer (which it assumes to be a machine integer), cast it into a C integer, then pass this to the library function, along with a specification of a C <span style=\"font-weight:Regular;font-family:Automatic\">char</span> * into which the library function will put its result, and from which the final Wolfram Language result will be retrieved.</p>\n<p>It’s worth emphasizing that most of the complexity here has to do with handling data types and conversions between them—something that the Wolfram Language goes to a lot of trouble to avoid usually exposing the user to. But when we’re connecting to external languages that make fundamental use of types, there’s no choice but to deal with them, and the complexity they involve. </p>\n<p>In the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FunctionCompile.html'>FunctionCompile</a></tt> above the first new construct we encounter is</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822threesectionsimg21.png\" alt='CreateTypeInstance' title='CreateTypeInstance' width='403' height='21' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822threesectionsimg21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21threesections_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21threesections_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The basic purpose of this is to create the buffer into which the external function will write its results.

To do this requires the new function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FromRawPointer.html'>FromRawPointer</a></tt>, which actually retrieves data from a specified location in memory. (And, yes, this is a raw dereferencing operation that will cause a crash if it isn’t done correctly.)</p>\n<p>All of this may at first seem rather complicated, but for what it’s doing, it’s remarkably simple—and greatly leverages the whole symbolic structure of the Wolfram Language. It’s also worth realizing that in this particular example, we’re just dipping into compiled code and then returning results. In larger-scale cases we’d be doing many more operations—typically specified directly by top-level Wolfram Language code—within compiled code, and so type declaration and conversion operations would be a smaller fraction of the code we have to write.</p>\n<p>One feature of the example we’ve just looked at is that it only uses built-in types.

I’ve heard some pretty <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/buzzword-convergence-making-sense-of-quantum-neural-blockchain-ai/'>wacky startup pitches</a> over the years, but this might possibly be the all-time winner. </p>\n<p>But as I thought about it, I realized that beyond the “absurdly extreme moonshot” character of this pitch, there’s some science that I’ve done that makes it clear that it’s also fundamentally philosophically confused. The nature of the confusion is interesting, however, and untangling it will give us an opportunity to illuminate some deep features of both intelligence and technology—and in the end suggest a way to think about the long-term trajectory of the very concept of technology and its relation to our universe.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with a scenario. Let’s say one of the little spacecraft comes across a planet where it sees complicated swirling patterns:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img1a.png\" alt='The Jupiter Great Red Spot' title='The Jupiter Great Red Spot' width='564' height='368' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img1a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"more-38447\"></span></p>\n<p><spacer></p>\n<p>The spacecraft sends out a probe to “make contact”. The swirling pattern “responds” by changing slightly. The spacecraft analyzes the change, and sends out another probe. And pretty soon there’s a whole “conversation” going on between the spacecraft and the planet. But, you might say, that’s nothing like an “intelligence” there; there’s just a “pure physical system” that operates through physical laws. </p>\n<p>OK, but now let’s imagine the spacecraft has returned to Earth and is checking it out. It detects complicated <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--artificial-radio-signals/'>patterns of radio signals</a>. It sends out a radio signal of its own. Something on Earth responds. A “conversation” ensues. Maybe the spacecraft is “talking to” a cellphone tower, doing automated handshakes with it. Maybe it reached a ham radio operator, and is exchanging Morse code with them. Or maybe—in an ultimate version of code injection—there’s a computer that’s interpreting the spacecraft’s signals as a program, and is sending back the results of running the program.</p>\n<p>It all seems quite sophisticated—and at some level worthy of the technological civilization we’ve built up here on Earth. But let’s zoom out a bit. There’s something coming from the spacecraft, that’s causing something to happen on Earth, that’s causing something to be returned to the spacecraft.</p>\n<p>And ultimately whatever is happening on Earth must be a physical process of some kind—operating according to the laws of physics. So what’s the difference between this and those swirling “just physics” patterns that the spacecraft found on the other planet? Everything is ultimately “just physics” after all. </p>\n<p>OK, you might say, that’s surely true. But on Earth, even though we might have started from physics, we’ve somehow now “ascended” through chemistry and biology and technology to get to something that’s fundamentally more sophisticated. But here we run into an important—if at first surprising—piece of basic science: my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we represent all those “physical processes” as computations (and our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> implies that all of physics is indeed ultimately computational). Now we can compare the computations that correspond to the planet with the swirling patterns to the ones that correspond to our Earth with us humans in the loop.</p>\n<p>And what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that they’re ultimately equivalent. The computations associated with the swirling patterns are ultimately just as sophisticated as the ones we achieve with our brains and our technology here on Earth. It’s far from obvious that this would be true. But it’s something one discovers when one <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html'>explores the computational universe of possible programs</a>.</p>\n<p>One might think that simple programs would produce only simple behavior, and that somehow the behavior would get progressively more complex with more complicated programs. But that’s not what one finds. Instead, there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/'>increasing evidence</a> that almost any program that doesn’t show obviously simple behavior can in fact show behavior that is as sophisticated as anything. </p>\n<p>It’s been known for about a century that there exist computation universal systems capable of being “programmed” to do essentially any computation. But what the Principle of Computational Equivalence says is that sophisticated computation is not only possible—even for simple programs—but is something that happens generically and ubiquitously. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean for our spacecraft? It means that what the spacecraft sees on Earth can be computationally no more sophisticated than what it sees on the planet with the swirling patterns. Yes, we consider there to be “intelligence” here on Earth. But what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that ultimately there’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>nothing abstractly different going on</a> from what’s going on in the swirling patterns.</p>\n<p>So if we characterize what’s going on here on Earth as an example of “intelligence” we really should say that those swirling patterns are also “examples of intelligence”. And, yes, it doesn’t seem much like human intelligence. But at an abstract computational level it’s really operating like intelligence—but to us humans it’s “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>There’s a common saying: “The weather has a mind of its own”. And what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that, yes, fluid dynamics in the atmosphere—and all the swirling patterns associated with it—are examples of computation that are just as sophisticated as those associated with human minds.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so there’s a sense in which the weather “has a mind of its own”. But it’s definitely not a “human-like mind”. Yes, the weather does sophisticated computations. But there’s no obvious way to attribute to those computations the purposes and intentions and other typical features of how we describe what goes on in a human mind. So if indeed we’re going to talk about the weather as being an intelligence, for us humans we have to consider it an “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>We started off talking about spacecraft going out into the cosmos to discover alien intelligence. But what the Principle Computational Equivalence is telling us is that actually there’s what we can think of as alien intelligence all around us. Yes, we humans have managed to get to the point where we do all sorts of sophisticated computations. But computations of just the same sophistication are being done in all sorts of systems that don’t have that whole human tower of biology and technology.</p>\n<p>For a long time it’s been a mystery why we’ve <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>never detected alien intelligence</a> out there in the cosmos. But actually I think there’s no lack of “alien intelligence”; indeed it’s all around us. But the point is that it really is alien. At an abstract computational level it’s like our intelligence. But in its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>details it&#8217;s not aligned with our intelligence</a>. Abstractly it’s intelligence, but it’s not human-like intelligence. It’s alien intelligence.</p>\n<h2 id='the-role-of-science-and-technology'>The Role of Science and Technology</h2>\n<p>OK, so we can think of lots of systems as being examples of “alien intelligence”. But how does that alien intelligence connect to our human intelligence? Sometimes it’s close enough that we humans can immediately “anthropomorphize” the system to “understand what it’s doing in human terms”. But often we need to put effort into “making a bridge”. And in fact we can view that as being what science and technology are ultimately trying to do. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re looking at swirling patterns in a fluid. The fluid is doing what it does, in effect continually running a computation that generates its behavior. But how can we &#8220;align&#8221; that with what&#8217;s going on in our brains? That&#8217;s where science comes in. Because what science is trying to do is to extract some kind of &#8220;human-relatable narrative&#8221; from the actual behavior of a system out there in the world. Or in some sense it’s trying to provide a “channel” through which we can <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>&#8220;communicate&#8221; with the &#8220;alien intelligence&#8221;</a> that is embodied in what’s out there in the world.</p>\n<p>So what about technology? Fundamentally <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-11--implications-for-technology'>technology is about trying to take what exists</a> out there in the world, and apply it to achieve human purposes. We have a fluid. Now we use it to create hydraulic technology that achieves some practical human purpose. We can see the history of technology as being a progressive effort to identify things out there in the world (metal ore, photoelectricity, liquid crystals, &#8230;) that can be sampled and fashioned in such a way as to achieve certain purposes we want.</p>\n<p>And insofar as we think of what’s out there in the world as being like alien intelligence, what technology is doing is finding ways to corral that intelligence into achieving human purposes. The truth is that in most of our technology today, we’re not letting that intelligence really do <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-2--the-need-for-a-new-intuition'>anything close to what it&#8217;s capable of</a>. We’re keeping it tightly constrained to take only steps that we can readily understand and foresee. It’s a bit like having a horse with a harness that constrains it to just walk slowly in a straight line—even though without the harness the horse could gallop around and do all sorts of elaborate things, albeit things that we might not readily be able to understand or foresee.</p>\n<p>So let’s come back to the spacecraft. It’s reached a planet. And it’s interacting with what’s there. Perhaps there’s some weird electrical storm going on. And, yes, we can think of that as an example of alien intelligence. But if the mission of the spacecraft is to discover technology then what it needs to do is to figure out whether there’s some way to interact with the electrical storm so as to achieve some human purpose.</p>\n<p>The storm does what the storm does. But maybe by moving some piece of metal around in just the right way it’s possible to get the storm to charge a battery. Or, more elaborately, perhaps processes in the storm could be used like an analog computer, say to compute solutions to equations. And perhaps—having seen the storm on this planet—it’s even possible to “bottle it up” and replicate it, say in a piece of consumer electronics.</p>\n<p>One way to describe what’s going on is just to say rather prosaically that we discovered a phenomenon on the planet, that we were able to use for technology. But more colorfully we could say that we encountered an alien intelligence, we found a way to communicate with it, and then we “brought back” technology from it.</p>\n<p>The original startup pitch was about spacecraft getting technology by discovering alien intelligence out in the cosmos. But really the whole spacecraft thing is a distraction. Because actually—as we’ve discussed—there’s plenty we can describe as “alien intelligence” all around us, even right here on Earth. And the issue is in a sense just how to “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>communicate with it</a>” and find ways to “harness it” for our technological purposes.</p>\n<p>We’ve learned in the past century that we can use electrons in semiconductors as a way to build computers. But what about other physical processes? Maybe flowing fluids, for example. Can we use that “alien intelligence” to make a new kind of computer? In the end, the point is that any technology is about finding and harnessing “alien intelligence”. That’s basically just what technology is, and always has been.</p>\n<p>The whole “alien intelligence” part of the story, though, is much more relevant when we’re thinking of technology that makes serious use of what we can identify as sophisticated computation. If we’re just using a system from nature for its physical mass, it doesn’t really feel as if we’re using its “intelligence”. But as soon as we try, for example, to base a general computer on it, it’s a quite different story. </p>\n<p>In getting technology from the universe we’re basically picking out certain aspects of what exists and choosing to apply these for our purposes. In doing science it seems like we have “less choice” about what aspects of the universe we deal with. After all, we might imagine that science is trying to give us a way to understand anything that’s out there in the universe. But in reality it’s much more like technology. The “scientific narratives” that we understand—at least at a given time in history—are ones that we’re in a sense “primed for”. Yes, something like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-4--fluid-flow'>fluid turbulence</a> might give us “in-your-face” exposure to something computationally sophisticated that’s far from what we normally talk about. But what science mostly concentrates on is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>creating narratives that are aligned</a> with our existing scientific understanding and discussions—much as technology is set up to be about things that are aligned with our existing human purposes.</p>\n<h2 id='extracting-technology-from-the-ruliad'>Extracting Technology from the Ruliad</h2>\n<p>One might imagine that—wherever it ultimately comes from—technology must at least always in the end be based on the laws of physics. But what’s emerging from our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> is that actually the story is considerably more complicated than that. </p>\n<p>It all begins with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>: the object that represents the entangled limit of all possible computations. The ruliad is a unique, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>formally necessary object</a>, that in a sense embodies all conceivable existence. And inevitably we are embedded within the ruliad, sampling certain aspects of it to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>form our perception of reality</a>.</p>\n<p>In principle there are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad'>all sorts of kinds of observers of the ruliad</a>, with all sorts of kinds of perceptions of reality. But the key point that has emerged as a foundation of our Physics Project is that “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#observers-like-us'>observers like us</a>” have certain general characteristics—specifically that we assume that we are persistent through time, and also that we are computationally bounded—and from these characteristics alone, we can abstractly deduce from the structure of the ruliad that we must “experience” core standard laws of known physics.</p>\n<p>The ruliad in a sense contains all possible physicses. But it’s our particular kind of sampling of the ruliad that leads us to the particular laws of physics that we currently know. An “alien intelligence” might sample the ruliad quite differently, and thus in effect “experience” quite different laws of physics.</p>\n<p>Somewhere underneath everything we can think of there being a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>giant hypergraph of individual atoms of existence</a>—but with the means of perception observers like us have, we inevitably “coarse grain” to the point where, for example, we experience this as continuous space. Another kind of observer, with different characteristics, might, for example, not do that coarse graining, might never experience continuous space, and might have a completely different perception of how the universe works.</p>\n<p>In some sense, therefore, physics is much more like technology than we might expect. There isn’t an “absolute physics”. There’s just the physics that we as observers extract from the ruliad. Much like there’s particular technology that we choose to build from the “raw material” that exists. Put another way, both physics and technology are ultimately things we “extract” from the ruliad, in effect by making certain choices.</p>\n<p>How we “extract” physics seems, however, much more constrained. For example, we as humans have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>only certain particular senses</a> through which we are biologically set up to experience the world. Yet we have the feeling that in technology we can in effect “construct whatever we want”—although inevitably “what we want” is also still at least influenced by how we are biologically set up.</p>\n<p>We’re very used to the idea that over time technology progresses—as we invent more, and work out new ways to use our “raw material” to achieve human purposes. But physics as a science progresses too. And in a sense what’s happening there is that we’re expanding our character as observers to be able to perceive and experience more of “what’s going on”—ultimately in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>Part of that expansion is actually a matter of technology. We’re building telescopes and microscopes and amplifiers that allow us to extend our raw human senses to be sensitive to more things. But there’s also another part of the expansion that is in effect intellectual: we’re developing new conceptual frameworks that allow us to “corral” things we see happening in the world into forms that “fit narratives” we’ve constructed.</p>\n<p>And the important point here is that neither our technology nor our physics is fixed. They’re in a sense co-evolving—gradually allowing more and more of the ruliad to be pulled into our narratives and our purposes. Or, put another way, what we observe is gradually expanding to encompass more and more of the ruliad, and to be able to make use of more and more of it. </p>\n<h2 id='reaching-out-across-rulial-space'>Reaching Out across Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>How are “different intelligences” manifest in the ruliad? We can imagine organizing the ruliad to be <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>laid out in some form of rulial space</a>. And from each point in rulial space one in effect gets a “different perspective” on the ruliad. And that&#8217;s at least the beginning of the story of how &#8220;different intelligences&#8221; exist and experience the ruliad.</p>\n<p>It’s similar to what happens with physical space: from different places in physical space one gets a different perspective on the universe. In physical space we have a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>concept of motion</a>: that observers like us can move from one place in space to another while in effect maintaining our coherence and integrity. </p>\n<p>How does this work in rulial space? We can think of different points in rulial space as corresponding to different computations, with different rules. So <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space'>rulial motion</a> in effect corresponds to making a translation between one computation and another. At the outset, it’s not obvious this would even in principle be possible. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies that it ultimately will be. The computations at different points in rulial space will (almost always) be equivalent in their sophistication—and as is typical with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>universal computation</a>—it’ll therefore in principle be possible to have an “interpretation process” that translates between them.</p>\n<p>But the big question is whether this can be achieved in practice. Just how far can a particular observer translate in rulial space while <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#what-can-human-mathematics-be-like'>maintaining their coherence and integrity</a>? </p>\n<p>The ruliad is a complex and (if sampled across slices in time) continually changing thing. But a critical feature is that there can be structures that have a certain persistence within it. In physical space these are things like particles (as well as black holes) that behave like “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>stable lumps of space</a>”—or like stable lumps in certain projections of the ruliad. In rulial space there can presumably also be structures with a certain persistence: <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space'>&#8220;particles&#8221; of rulial space</a>. And these “particles” somehow correspond to features that “survive across different computational perspectives”—or in effect represent “robust concepts”.</p>\n<p>When we talk about “different intelligences” a very familiar example is different human minds. And in a sense we can think of different human minds as being laid out in rulial space—with each mind being at a different rulial position, and thus having a different computational rule by which it operates, and a different “experience of the ruliad”. </p>\n<p>So how can these minds “communicate”? Ultimately it is through “rulial motion”. But potentially the most robust form of rulial motion is through rulial particles—which we’ve identified above with the abstract idea of “robust concepts”. Put in a practical way: different (human) minds operate internally in different ways. But they can still “communicate” by exchanging something that in effect “survives translation” between one mind and another: rulial particles corresponding to robust concepts (say expressed in a language).</p>\n<p>But, OK, we can imagine rulial space with lots of human minds laid out at different places, with ones that communicate more easily closer together. So what about “alien intelligences”? Well, each one is somewhere in rulial space. But they may be far away from where our human minds are.</p>\n<p>We can imagine our rulial particles—or “robust concepts”—being able to reach a certain distance in rulial space. The human idea of “excitement” might for example be able to reach the place in rulial space where we’d find the minds of dogs. But what about the weather, for example? Well, as an alien intelligence, it’s presumably much further away in rulial space—and, anthropomorphize it as we might—it’s not clear what its notion of “excitement” would be.</p>\n<p>It’s an often-asked question why—with our spacecraft and radio telescopes and everything else—we haven’t ever run across what we consider to be “naturally occurring” alien intelligences. In the past we might have imagined that the answer is that there just isn’t anything like “intelligence” (outside of us humans) to be found in any part of the universe that we can probe. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> says that’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>fundamentally not true</a>, and that in fact “abstract intelligence” is thoroughly ubiquitous among systems with all but the most obviously simple behavior. </p>\n<p>So to “find” alien intelligence it’s not that we need a more powerful radio telescope (or a better spacecraft) that can reach further in physical space. Rather, the issue is to be able to reach far enough in rulial space. Or, put another way, even if we view the weather as “having a mind of its own”, the rulial distance between “its mind” and our human minds may be too great for us to be able to “understand” and “communicate with it”. </p>\n<p>So what will it take for us to “bridge this rulial gap”? At some level it’s just about building the right science and technology. We can think of science as being about defining a way to “translate” from the computational rules by which some particular system operates to the computational way our human minds operate. Or, in terms of rulial space, finding a way to “move” from the rulial position of the system to the rulial position of our minds—and translating from the way a system works to a “human narrative” that represents it.</p>\n<p>Centuries ago we might have just said “the planets do what they do”; maybe their motion in space is driven by an “alien intelligence” that we don’t understand. But then <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>along came mathematical science</a> and we were able to “translate” from the intrinsic computation done by the planets to a mathematical description that we internalized enough to consider it a human narrative that we understand.</p>\n<p>In some sense at any given time in intellectual history our minds “reach out a certain distance in rulial space”. We’ve developed conceptual frameworks that allow us to maintain a coherent understanding of a certain range of things—with that range growing as we invent new frameworks. At one time our “domain of understanding”—or the region of rulial space that we could reach—didn’t encompass the behavior of electricity. But our “intellectual expansion” in rulial space eventually reached this, and the result is that we can now use electricity as “raw material” from which to construct technology.</p>\n<p>One way we “expand our reach in rulial space” is in effect conceptual: by expanding what we understand. But another way is by being able to “sense” or “measure” more. When we invent radio—or, for that matter, gravitational wave detection—there are immediately new kinds of processes that we manage to “connect to human experience”. Or, put another way, there are more distant parts of the ruliad that we’re able to reach.</p>\n<p>More prosaically, we can say that if we want to be able to use something for technology, we’d better be able to detect that it’s there, and we’d better be able to understand it well enough that we can see how it could align with our human purposes. We can think of the ruliad as being full of alien intelligences—with plenty of capabilities to “mine”. But to be able to actually mine something for our technological purposes we have to be able to reach it across rulial space; we have to be able to connect it to us.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for the original startup pitch? Yes, it’s a good idea to “mine alien intelligences” for technology. In fact, that’s basically where technology always comes from. But there’s no need to send out spacecraft, “discover” alien intelligence, and so on. There are “alien intelligences” all around us; the issue is just to reach them across rulial space, and be able to “communicate” with them. But what we’ve argued is that the process of progressively reaching out in rulial space is just the general process of progressively advancing science (and the technology on which it depends).</p>\n<p>So, yes, by all means explore more of what’s out there in the world, with more, different kinds of sensors and measurements. Then try to “understand” what you see enough to be able to tell how to align it with human purposes, and make technology out of it. But there’s no pressing need for interstellar spacecraft in this picture. It’s just a matter of doing more science to expand our domain in the ruliad, and mine more of rulial space.</p>\n<h2 id='the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>The Evolution of Purpose and the Colonization of Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>We can think of technology as being about setting up things that exist in the world (or ultimately in the ruliad) to achieve human purposes. And we’ve talked about how the advance of science and technology allows us to progressively reach further in rulial space to get “raw material” for our technology. But we’ve said that technology is intended to “achieve human purposes”. So what might those purposes ultimately be?</p>\n<p>Our purposes have certainly evolved over the course of human history. In today’s world, we might view it as purposeful to walk on a treadmill, or to trade cryptocurrencies. But it would be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/#aliens-and-the-philosophy-of-purpose'>challenging to explain the purpose</a> of such things to someone from even a few hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>In a sense, purposes evolve as we build new conceptual frameworks, and as we set up technology that allows us to do new things. More abstractly, we might say that purposes are also something defined by places in rulial space. So when we talk about the evolution of purposes, what we’re really asking is where in rulial space our history and development has led us, and will lead us in the future.</p>\n<p>And certainly in the vastness of the whole ruliad, our existing human purposes occupy just an infinitesimally tiny part. Think, for example, of the natural world even as we are currently aware of it. The vast majority of things in it do not seem in any way aligned with our purposes—and we have not been able to mine them for technology. Historically, however, there’s been progressive expansion in the domain of our purposes. There was a time when we knew about magnetic rocks, but had no purpose for magnetism. But over the course of time, from compasses to actuators to memories, more and more human purposes have emerged that connect to the phenomenon of magnetism.</p>\n<p>And in a sense we can view the whole core trajectory of human progress as being about the expansion of the region of rulial space—and the ruliad—that represents our purposes. So how will this evolve?</p>\n<p>As I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>discussed extensively before</a>, there seem to be two central features that we as entities in the ruliad have. First, that we are computationally bounded. And second, that we believe we are persistent in time. Computational boundedness is essentially the statement that the region of rulial space that we occupy is limited. In some sense our minds can coherently span a certain region of rulial space, but it’s a bounded region. </p>\n<p>What about persistence in time? It means that even though we are always being reconstructed out of different atoms of existence (and different atoms of space), we conflate things to the point where we experience a single continuous thread of existence.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these features suggest a picture of us being a kind of “blob” that gradually <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>moves around</a> in rulial space. Does it matter that there isn’t just a single human mind? Well, yes. Without some kind of “observer” there’s no real way to even define what it means to have a “blob”. And in the end it’s a story of consistency of observers observing observers. But the result is that we can think of our whole collective “flotilla” of human purposes as being something localized that moves around in rulial space, expanding the region of the ruliad that it reaches.</p>\n<p>But just how far can this go? Imagine that at some time in the distant future we have successfully explored—and “colonized”—much of rulial space. To do this we’d certainly have to have broken out of the particular constraints of our biological construction, and made use of “additional raw material” in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>But what would it mean to be spread across a large swath of rulial space? Our very notion of existence seems to depend on localization in rulial space. The thing that we view as “us” is something particular and coherent. To be “bigger” in rulial space is to deny that particularity and coherence, and to become something generic that does not represent any kind of “specific entity that exists”.</p>\n<p>In a sense, it’s a pyrrhic view of the ultimate limit of our technological and other evolution. As we progress, we gradually “mine” more and more of the ruliad, pulling it into the domain of technology and of our “human” (or post-human) purposes. But in doing so, we eventually transcend the very characteristics that we identify with existence. In other words, if we go too far with our expansion in the ruliad, we simply cease to exist, at least in the sense that we currently define existence. </p>\n<p>Put another way, if we “absorb” more and more “alien intelligence” there’s eventually no longer any coherent “us”. Of course, the very notion of coherence is something we’re basically defining from our current human view of things. And no doubt there are other definitions that could be given. But they’re certainly far away from our current place in rulial space, and it’s not even clear they can be reached without some kind of “discontinuity of motion” that would in effect fundamentally break their connection to us as we are now.</p>\n<h2 id='face-to-face-with-alien-intelligence,-out-in-rulial-space'>Face to Face with Alien Intelligence, Out in Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>At a fundamental level, the ruliad is a purely computational object, that we can think of as being made of pure, abstract atoms of existence (or “emes”). When observers like us sample the ruliad we can attribute to it the characteristics that correspond to our perception of physical reality. And a notable feature of that sampling is that it supports the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>idea of pure motion</a> in physical space. In other words, it allows for the possibility that structures can “maintain their perceived physical integrity” while being “re-formed” out of different atoms of space, which themselves are interpretations of the pure atoms of existence in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But as soon as we start thinking about any kind of serious motion in rulial (rather than physical) space it no longer makes sense to talk about anything like “maintaining physical integrity”, not least because in different places in rulial space the very notion of physics changes. But wherever we are in the ruliad we can still think about what’s going on as computation. We might have some way of observing or sampling the ruliad that gives us some perception of reality—like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>physics</a>, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>mathematics</a>. But if we “atomize” things down to the lowest level, we’ll always find raw computation.</p>\n<p>As “physical observers like us” we only have limited capabilities to probe or manipulate the raw ruliad and affect what we perceive as physical reality. We can move physical objects around, maintaining what we observe of their structure. In principle we could <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/'>imagine deconstructing objects</a> into individual atoms of existence, then recreating them “transporter style” somewhere else in physical space. But as of now, we don’t know how to do this, and most likely it’s not possible for observers like us—because it would require “outcomputing” computationally irreducible features of the structure of space down at the level of individual atoms of space, which is far from what computationally bounded observers like us can expect to do.</p>\n<p>But what about raw computation, of the kind that ultimately makes up the ruliad? There the story is different. Because we’re no longer constrained by our character as physical observers, so we’re free to in effect “make up any computation we want”. To explore the physical universe we need physical motion or something like it. And at least for observers like us the only way to achieve this seems to be to progressively move structures across physical space. But to find out what can happen in the computational universe we can effectively just write down any rule (i.e. any program) that appears “anywhere in the ruliad”, and run it.</p>\n<p>Of course, when we run a rule on a practical computer, it’s just an emulation of what’s happening in the raw ruliad. But it’s just an abstract rule—so although it will run astronomically slower, its ultimate behavior in our emulation will inevitably be identical to what it is when implemented in terms of individual atoms of existence in the “raw ruliad”.</p>\n<p>In principle we could take the same approach in emulating the elements that make up our physical reality. But observers like us are so big relative to the raw elements of the ruliad that we can’t expect our emulations to be at a scale where we can faithfully reproduce what we perceive. (Needless to say, in practice we can still get good approximations, and this is a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/the-wolfram-physics-project-a-one-year-update/#towards-experimental-implications'>particularly fertile application of our Physics Project</a>.) </p>\n<p>But when we’re dealing with “raw computation” down at the lowest level of the raw ruliad, we can expect to faithfully emulate it. And so it is that we can just pick a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave'>cellular automaton</a> or a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machine</a> or some other kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>computational system</a>—that in effect comes from anywhere in the ruliad—and emulate it to find out what it does. There’s no “object we have to move” to be able to “look at that part of the ruliad”. We’re emulating things down at the level of individual atoms of existence, and seeing what happens.</p>\n<p>We can think about our computational experiments as letting us “jump” to find out what it’s like anywhere in the ruliad. And as we “suddenly materialize” somewhere in the ruliad it’s as if we’re immediately “face to face” with whatever “alien intelligence” there is at that place in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But what can “observers like us” expect to make of that alien intelligence? Well, to be able “communicate” or even “relate” we somehow have to be able to “bridge the gap in rulial space”. And since we just “jumped to a place in rulial space” we don’t immediately have any “progressive path” that “incrementally” takes us from our familiar position in rulial space to wherever the alien intelligence is.</p>\n<p>But what does that feel like in practice? The whole idea of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a> is just to go anywhere we want in the computational universe or in the ruliad, and see what happens when we run the rules we find there. And it’s indeed routine to find that what they do seems quite “alien”. Still, they often have certain essential features that for example remind us of the natural world as we observe it. But our standard methods of science (and mathematics)—developed on the basis of being “observers like we are today”—don’t readily allow us to “understand” the behavior of these systems chosen in the course of doing ruliology. To us they usually just seem to be “showing <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>”, and behaving in ways that we can effectively get no handle on. </p>\n<p>But still, we can in a sense view these programs “out there in the computational universe” (and in effect strewn around the ruliad) as showing us what’s possible. They’re like alien intelligences that we know exist, but that we don’t yet understand, and don’t yet know how to harness or relate to. We can see them as some kind of beacons of possible technology of the future—of things that “exist in the ruliad”, but that we haven’t yet been able to connect to human purposes.</p>\n<p>But so how might we make this connection? Well, as it happens, I’ve devoted much of my life to what can be viewed as the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>construction of a systematic bridge</a> between what’s “computationally possible” and what we humans think of as important. For that’s the story of what I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a>—and indeed of the whole intellectual structure that is the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s infinite potential content in the ruliad. But one can view the goal of the Wolfram Language as being to represent—in a way that’s optimized for us humans to understand—those parts that we humans consider important. The language lets us use the concepts of computation not only to crystallize our existing thinking, but also to expand what we can think about, in effect letting us reach out further in rulial space. Computational language is the general way that we “tame the ruliad”—extend the frontier of “human colonization” in the ruliad, and in the end “mine” more and more of the ruliad for “useful technology”.</p>\n<p>Just in terms of its practical place in the world today I’ve often said that the Wolfram Language is like an “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/our-mission-and-the-opportunity-of-artifacts-from-the-future/'>artifact from the future</a>”. But now we see a deep sense in which this is true. The raw ruliad is just “out there”, with “infinite potential”, but as something whose fundamental character has nothing to do with us humans. But what computational language is about is delivering what one can think of as the ultimate “meta-artifact”: something that progressively turns the raw ruliad into “human-recognizable technology”. </p>\n<p>Much of this progress involves the <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>specific, systematic design</a> of the Wolfram Language. But there are also forays that in effect jump further out into rulial space. For example, we’ve often enumerated large collections of simple programs, identifying ones that satisfy a certain criterion. And sometimes that feels a lot like “leveraging alien intelligence” without “understanding” it. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>rule 30 cellular automaton</a>, for example, is a good pseudorandom generator, even though we <a href='https://www.rule30prize.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>don&#8217;t really &#8220;understand&#8221;</a> even fairly basic things about it.</p>\n<p>And, yes, computational language is what we need to concretely “state a criterion”, in effect expressing what we’re thinking about in computational terms—that we can use, for example, to let us explicitly search the ruliad for an “alien intelligence” that does what we want.</p>\n<p>What does it look like out in the “raw ruliad”? It’s easy to start just looking at simple programs, say picked at random. And, yes, they have all sorts of elaborate behavior:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img5b.png\" alt='' title='' width='452' height='360' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622AIimg5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But what is this behavior “achieving”? Yes, it’s following the particular underlying rules that have been given. But we don’t have any immediate way to connect it to “human purposes”. And in general we can expect that to make that connection what’s needed is for those purposes themselves to “expand”.</p>\n<p>Maybe at some moment we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/music-mathematica-and-the-computational-universe/'>call what&#8217;s produced &#8220;art&#8221;</a>, and assign it some “aesthetic purpose”. Maybe at some point we see that it satisfies some engineering purpose that we’ve just realized we should care about. But in general, computational language is the way we can make the connection between “raw computational processes” out there in the ruliad, and our patterns of thinking about things. It’s the ultimate way for us to “communicate with alien intelligence”. </p>\n<h2 id='the-launch-of-a-rulial-space-program'>The Launch of a Rulial Space Program</h2>\n<p>We began with the far-out startup pitch of sending spacecraft to discover alien intelligence and bring its technology back to Earth. But what we’ve realized is that actually no spacecraft—of the ordinary kind—are needed. There’s “alien intelligence” to be found everywhere; you don’t have to travel to interstellar space to find it. But the challenge is to connect the “alien intelligence” to human purposes, and extract from it what we consider “useful technology”. Or, put another way, the issue is not about traversing physical space, but rather about traversing rulial space.</p>\n<p>With our spacecraft we humans have so far reached about a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28distance+to+furthest+manmade+object%29%2F%28radius+of+the+universe%29'>20-trillionth of the way across the physical universe</a>. But no doubt we’ve reached a far smaller fraction of the way across the ruliad. As our science, knowledge and technology increase, we gradually reach further into rulial space. But whether it’s our failure to communicate with cetaceans or our inability to make computers out of, say, fluids, it’s clear that by many measures the distance we’ve gone so far is not so large.</p>\n<p>In a sense the startup idea of “harnessing alien intelligence” is the meta-idea of all technology—that in our terms we can state as being to connect what’s “computationally possible” in the ruliad with purposes we humans want to achieve. And I’ve argued that the ultimate meta-technology for doing this is not spacecraft but computational language. Because computational language is what we need to make a bridge between what we care about, and “raw computation” out in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to send physical spacecraft out into interstellar space. But it’s actually a lot easier to probe the much richer possibilities of the ruliad—because in a sense it’s straightforward to put a “rulial spacecraft” anywhere. We just have to pick a rule (or program), then see what the “world” it generates is. But the challenge is then in a sense one of interpretation. What is happening in that world? Can we relate it to things we care about?</p>\n<p>At the outset, all we’re likely to see at some “random place” in the ruliad is rampant computational irreducibility. But it’s a fundamental fact that wherever there’s computational irreducibility, there must also be slices of computational reducibility to be found. In the ordinary physical universe that we experience, those are basically our perceived laws of physics. But even in a random sample of the ruliad we can expect there’ll be computational reducibility to be found. It’ll typically be “alien stuff”, though. It might have the character of science, but it won’t be like our existing science. And most likely it won’t align with anything we currently think we care about.</p>\n<p>But that is the great challenge and promise of mounting a “rulial space program”. To be confronted not with what we might recognize as “new life and new civilizations”, but with things for which we have no description and no current way of thinking. Perhaps we might view it merely as humbling to encounter such things, and to realize how small a part of the ruliad we yet understand. But we can also view it as a beacon of where we could go. And we can view a whole “rulial space program” as a way of systematizing the ultimate project of exploring all formally possible processes. Or we could think about it not just as defining a single “startup opportunity”—but rather as defining the “meta-opportunity” of all possible technology startups&#8230;.</p>\n",

But how can one get an intuition for what is initially the rather abstract <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>idea of multicomputation</a>? A good approach, I believe, is to see it in action in familiar systems and situations. And I explore here what seems like a particularly good example: games and puzzles.<span id=\"more-37124\"></span></p>\n<p>One might not imagine that something as everyday as well-known games and puzzles would have any connection to the formalism for something like quantum mechanics. But the idea of multicomputation provides a link. And indeed one can view the very possibility of being able to have “interesting” games and puzzles as being related to a core phenomenon of multicomputation: <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2022/06/multicomputational-irreducibility/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multicomputational irreducibility</a>.</p>\n<p>In an ordinary computational system each state of the system has a unique successor, and ultimately there is a single thread of time that defines a process of computation. But in a multicomputational system the key idea is that states can have multiple successors—and tracing their behavior defines a whole multiway graph of branching and merging threads of time. And the point is that this is directly related to how one can think about typical games and puzzles.</p>\n<p>Given a particular state of a game or puzzle, a player must typically decide what to do next. And where the idea of multicomputation comes in is that there are usually several choices that they can make. In any particular instance of the game, they’ll make a particular choice. But the point of the multicomputational paradigm is to look globally at the consequences of all possible choices—and to produce a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway graph</a> that represents them.</p>\n<p>The notion of making what we call a multiway graph has actually existed—usually under the name of “game graphs”—for games and puzzles for a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#some-backstory'>bit more than a hundred years</a>. But with the multicomputational paradigm there are now some more general concepts that can be applied to these constructs. And in turn understanding the relation to games and puzzles has the potential to provide a new level of intuition and familiarity about multiway graphs.</p>\n<p>My particular goal here is to investigate—fairly systematically—a sequence of well-known games and puzzles using the general methods we’ve been developing for studying multicomputational systems. As is typical in investigations that connect with everyday things, we’ll encounter all sorts of specific details. And while these may not immediately seem relevant to larger-scale discussions, they are important in our effort to provide a realistic and relatable picture of actual games and puzzles—and in allowing the connections we make with multicomputation to be on a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that the possibility of relating games and puzzles to physics is basically something that wouldn’t make sense without our Physics Project. For games and puzzles are normally at some fundamental level discrete—especially in the way that they involve discrete branching of possibilities. And if one assumes physics is fundamentally continuous, there’s no reason to expect a connection. But a key idea of our Physics Project is that the physical world is at the lowest level discrete—like games and puzzles. And what’s more, our Physics Project posits that physics—like games and puzzles—has discrete possibilities to explore.</p>\n<p>At the outset each of the games and puzzles I discuss here may seem rather different in their structure and operation. But what we’ll see is that when viewed in a multicomputational way, there is remarkable—and almost monotonous—uniformity across our different examples. I won’t comment too much on the significance of what we see until the end, when I’ll begin to discuss how various important multicomputational phenomena may play out in the context of games and puzzles. And how the very difficulty of conceptualizing multicomputation in straightforward human terms is what fundamentally leads to the engaging character of games and puzzles.</p>\n<h2 id='tic-tac-toe'>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>\n<p>Consider a simplified version of tic-tac-toe (AKA “noughts and crosses”) played on a 2×2 board.

Or, put another way, it’s when we find the multiway graph somehow “difficult to decode” that we get a rich and engaging game or puzzle.</p>\n<p>In any particular instance of playing a game we’re basically following a specific path (that in analogy to physics we can call a “timelike path”) through the multiway graph (or “game graph”) for the game. And at some level we might just make the global statement that the game graph represents all such paths. But what the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> suggests is that there are also more local statements that we can usefully make. In particular, at every step along a timelike path we can look “transversally” in the multiway graph, and see the “instantaneous branchial graph” that represents the “entanglement” of our path with “nearby paths”.</p>\n<p>Figuring out “what move to make next” is then in a sense about deciding in “what direction” in branchial space to go. And what makes a game difficult is that we can’t readily predict what happens as we “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-beyond-physical-space:-the-branchial-case'>travel through branchial space</a>”. There’s a certain analogy here to the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>. Going from one state to another along some timelike path, computational irreducibility implies that even though we may know the underlying rules, we can’t readily predict their consequences—because it can require an irreducible amount of computation to figure out what their consequences will be after many steps. </p>\n<p>Predicting “across branchial space” is a related, but slightly different phenomenon, that one can describe as “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2022/06/multicomputational-irreducibility/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multicomputational irreducibility</a>”. It’s not about the difficulty of working out a particular path of computation, but instead about the difficulty of seeing how many entangled paths interact.</p>\n<p>When one plays a game, it’s common to talk about “how many moves ahead one can see”. And in our terms here, this is basically about asking how “far out in branchial space” we can readily get. As <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>computationally bounded entities</a>, we have a certain “reach” in branchial space. And the game is “difficult for us” if that reach isn’t sufficient to be able to get to something like a “winning position”. </p>\n<p>There’s another point here, though. What counts as “winning” in a game is typically reaching some particular places or regions in the multiway graph. But the definition of these places or regions is typically something very computationally bounded (“just see if there’s a line of X’s”, etc.). It’s a certain “observation” of the system, that extracts just a particular (computationally bounded) sampling of the complete state. And then what’s key is that this sampling doesn’t manage to “decode the multicomputational irreducibility”. </p>\n<p>There’s an analogy here to thermodynamics. The fact that in thermodynamics we perceive “heat” and “entropy increase” is a consequence of the fact that our (coarse-grained) measurements can’t <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>&#8220;decode&#8221; the computationally irreducible process</a> that leads to the particular states generated in the system. Similarly, the fact we perceive it to be “hard to figure out how to win a game” is a consequence of the fact that our criterion for winning isn’t able to “look inside the playing of the game” and “decode what’s going on” to the point where it’s in effect just selecting one particular, straightforward path. Instead it’s a question of going through the multicomputationally irreducible process of playing the game, and in effect “seeing where it lands” relative to the observation of winning. </p>\n<p>There’s also an analogy here to quantum mechanics. Tracing through many possible paths of playing a game is like following many threads of history in quantum mechanics, and the criterion of winning is like a quantum measurement that selects certain threads. In our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> we imagine that we as observers are extended in branchial space, “knitting together” different threads of history through our belief in our own single thread of experience. In games, the analog of our belief in a single thread of experience is presumably in effect that “all that matters is who wins or loses; it doesn’t matter how the game is played inside”. </p>\n<p>To make a closer analogy with quantum mechanics one can start thinking about combining different chunks of “multiway game play”, and trying to work out a calculus for how those chunks fit together.</p>\n<p>The games we’ve discussed here are all in a sense pure “games of skill”. But in games where there’s also an element of chance we can think of this as causing what is otherwise a single path in the multiway graph to “fuzz out” into a bundle of paths, and what is otherwise a single point in branchial space to become a whole extended region.</p>\n<p>In studying different specific games and puzzles, we’ve often had to look at rather simplified cases in order to get multiway graphs of manageable size. But if we look at very large multiway graphs, are there perhaps overall regularities that will emerge? Is there potentially some kind of “continuum limit” for game graphs?</p>\n<p>It’ll almost inevitably be the case that if we look in “enough detail” we’ll see all sorts of multicomputational irreducibility in action. But in our Physics Project—and indeed in the multicomputational paradigm in general—a key issue is that relevant observers don’t see that level of detail. And much like the emergence of thermodynamics or the gas laws from underlying molecular dynamics, the very existence of underlying computational irreducibility inevitably leads to simple laws for what the observer can perceive.</p>\n<p>So what is the analog of “the observer” for a game? For at least some purposes it can be thought of as basically the “win” criteria. So now the question arises: if we look only at these criteria, can we derive the analog of “laws of physics”, insensitive to all the multicomputationally irreducible details underneath?</p>\n<p>There’s much more to figure out about this, but perhaps one place to start is to look at the large-scale structure of branchial space—and the multiway graph—in various games. And one basic impression in many different games is that—while the character of branchial graphs may change between “different stages” in the game—across a single branchial graph there tends to be a certain uniformity. If one looks at the details there may be plenty of multicomputational irreducibility. But at some kind of “perceptible level” different parts of the graph may seem similar. And this suggests that the “local impression of the game” will tend to be similar at a particular stage even when quite different moves have been made, that take one to quite different parts of the “game space” defined by the branchial graph.</p>\n<p>But while there may be similarity between different parts of the branchial graph, what we’ve seen is that in some games and puzzles the branchial graph breaks up into multiple disconnected regions. And what this reflects is the presence of distinct “conserved sectors” in a game—regions of game space that players can get into, but are then stuck with (at least for a certain time), much as in spacetime <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>event horizons can prevent transport</a> between different regions of physical space. </p>\n<p>Another (related) effect that we notice in some games and puzzles but not others is large “holes” in the multiway graph: places where between two points in the graph there are multiple “distant” paths. When the multiway graph is densely connected, there’ll typically always be a way to “fix any mistake” by rerouting through nearby paths. But when there is a hole it is a sign that one can end up getting “committed” to one course of action rather than another, and it will be many steps before it’s possible to get to the same place as the other course of action would have reached. </p>\n<p>If we assume that at some level all we ultimately “observe” in the multiway graph is the kind of coarse-graining that corresponds to assessing winning or losing then inevitably we’ll be dealing with a distribution of possible paths. Without “holes” these paths can be close together, and may seem obviously similar. But when there’s a hole there can be different paths that are far apart. And the fact there can be distant paths that are “part of the same distribution” can then potentially be thought of as something like a quantum superposition effect. </p>\n<p>Are there analogs of general relativity and the path integral in games? To formulate this with clarity we’d have to define more carefully the character of “game space”. Presumably there’ll be the analog of a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-causal-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal graph</a>. And presumably there’ll also be an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>analog of energy</a> in game space, associated with the “density of activity” at different places in game space. Then the analog of the phenomenon of gravity will be something like that the best game plays (i.e. the geodesic paths through the game graph) will tend to be deflected by the presence of high densities of activity. In other words, if there are lots of things to do when a game is in a certain state, good game plays will tend to be “pulled towards that state”. And at some level this isn’t surprising: when there’s high density of activity in the game graph, there will tend to be more options about what to do, so it’s more likely that one will be able to “do a good game play” if one goes through there.</p>\n<p>So far we didn’t explicitly talk about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--games-between-programs/'>strategies for games</a>. But in our multicomputational framework a strategy has a fairly definite interpretation: it is a place in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>rulial space</a>, where in effect one’s assuming a certain set of rules about how to construct the multiway graph. In other words, given a strategy one is choosing some edges in the multiway graph (or some possible events in the associated multiway causal graph), and dropping others. </p>\n<p>In general it can be hard to talk about the “space of possible strategies”—because it’s like talking about the “space of possible programs”. But this is precisely what rulial space lets us talk about. What exact “geometry” the “space of strategies” has will depend on how we choose to coordinatize rulial space. But once again there will tend to be a certain level of coarse-graining achieved by looking only at the kinds of things one discusses in game theory—and at this level we can expect that all sorts of standard “structural” game-theoretic results will generically hold.</p>\n<h2 id='personal-notes'>Personal Notes</h2>\n<p>Even as a kid I was never particularly into playing games or doing puzzles. And maybe it’s a sign I was always a bit too much of a scientist. Because just picking specific moves always seemed to me too arbitrary. To get my interest I needed a bigger picture, more of a coherent intellectual story. But now, in a sense, that’s just what the multicomputational approach to games and puzzles that I discuss here is bringing to us. Yes, it’s very “humanizing” to be able think about making particular moves. But the multicomputational approach immediately gives one a coherent global view that, at least to me, is intellectually much more satisfying.</p>\n<p>The explorations I’ve discussed here can be thought of as originating from a single note in<em> </em><em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>. In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond/'>Chapter 5</a> of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I had a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>section where I first introduced multiway systems</a>.

Twenty years passed and I didn’t think much more about this.

Quantum mechanics had always seemed like something mysterious—the abstract result of pure mathematical formalism. But seeing the connection to multiway systems began to suggest that one might actually be able to “understand quantum mechanics” as something that could “mechanically arise” from some concrete underlying structure.</p>\n<p>I started to think about finding ways to explain quantum mechanics at an intuitive level. And for that I needed a familiar analogy: something everyday that one could connect to multiway systems. I immediately thought about games. And in <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/archives/index?i=2020' target=_blank rel=noopener>September 2020 I decided to take a look</a> at games to explore this analogy in more detail. I quickly analyzed games like tic-tac-toe and Nim—as well as simple sliding block puzzles and the Towers of Hanoi. But I wanted to explore more games and puzzles. And I had <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/all-by-date/'>other projects to do</a>, so the multicomputational analysis of games and puzzles got set aside. The Towers of Hanoi reappeared earlier this year, when I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#the-topology-of-proof-space'>used it as an example of generating a proof-like multiway graph</a>, in connection with my study of the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>physicalization of metamathematics</a>. And finally, a few weeks ago I decided it was time to write down what I knew so far about games and puzzles—and produce what’s here.</p>\n<h2 id='thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>Thanks to Brad Klee and Ed Pegg for extensive help in the final stages of the analysis given here—as well as to Christopher Wolfram for inspiration in 2017, and help in 2020.</p>\n",

But what&#8217;s become increasingly clear—particularly in the last few years—is that it&#8217;s actually even much more important than I ever imagined. My <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>original goal</a> in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was to take a step beyond the mathematical paradigm that had defined the state of the art in science for three centuries—and to introduce a new paradigm based on computation and on the exploration of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>computational universe of possible programs</a>. And already in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> one can see that there&#8217;s immense richness to what can be done with this new paradigm. <span id=\"more-36963\"></span></p>\n<p>There’s a new abstract basic science—that I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>now call ruliology</a>—that’s concerned with studying the detailed properties of systems with simple rules. There’s a vast new source of “raw material” to “mine” from the computational universe, both for making models of things and for developing technology. And there are new, computational ways to think about fundamental features of how systems in nature and elsewhere work.</p>\n<p>But what’s now becoming clear is that there’s actually something still bigger, still more overarching that the paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> lays the foundations for. In a sense, <em>A New Kind of Science</em> defines how one can use computation to think about things. But what we’re now realizing is that actually computation is not just a way to think about things: it is at a very fundamental level what everything actually is. </p>\n<p>One can see this as a kind of ultimate limit of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. What we call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a> is the entangled limit of all possible computations. And what we, for example, experience as physical reality is in effect just our particular sampling of the ruliad. And it’s the ideas of <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>and particularly things like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>—that lay the foundations for understanding how this works.</p>\n<p>When I wrote <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>discussed the possibility</a> that there might be a way to find a fundamental model of physics based on simple programs. And from that seed has now come the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>, which, with its broad connections to existing mathematical physics, now seems to show that, yes, it&#8217;s really true that our physical universe is “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>computational all the way down</a>”. </p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s more. It&#8217;s not just that at the lowest level there&#8217;s some specific rule operating on a vast network of atoms of space. It&#8217;s that underneath everything is all possible computation, encapsulated in the single unique construct that is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. And what determines our experience—and the science we use to summarize it—is what characteristics we as observers have in sampling the ruliad. </p>\n<p>There is a tower of ideas that relate to fundamental questions about the nature of existence, and the foundations not only of physics, but also of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>mathematics</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>computer science</a> and a host of other fields. And these ideas build crucially on the paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. But they need something else as well: what I now call the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>. There were hints of it in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> when I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>discussed multiway systems</a>. But it has only been within the past couple of years that this whole new paradigm has begun to come into focus. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I explored some of the remarkable things that individual computations out in the computational universe can do. What the multicomputational paradigm now does is to consider the aggregate of multiple computations—and in the end the entangled limit of all possible computations, the ruliad.</p>\n<p>The Principle of Computational Equivalence is in many ways the intellectual culmination of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>—and it has many deep consequences. And one of them is the idea—and uniqueness—of the ruliad. The Principle of Computational Equivalence provides a very general statement about what all possible computational systems do. What the ruliad then does is to pull together the behaviors and relationships of all these systems into a single object that is, in effect, an ultimate representation of everything computational, and indeed in a certain sense simply of everything. </p>\n<h2 id='the-intellectual-journey:-from-physics-to-physics,-and-beyond'>The Intellectual Journey: From Physics to Physics, and Beyond</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> 20 years ago</a> was for me already the culmination of an <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/'>intellectual journey</a> that had begun more than 25 years earlier. I had started in theoretical physics as a teenager in the 1970s. And stimulated by my needs in physics, I had then <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>built my first computational language</a>. A couple of years later I returned to basic science, now interested in some very fundamental questions. And from my blend of experience in physics and computing I was led to start trying to formulate things in terms of computation, and computational experiments. And soon <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>discovered the remarkable fact</a> that in the computational universe, even very simple programs can generate immensely complex behavior.</p>\n<p>For several years I <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>studied the basic science</a> of the particular class of simple programs known as <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave'>cellular automata</a>—and the things I saw led me to identify some important general phenomena, most notably <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>. Then in 1986—having “answered most of the obvious questions I could see”—I left basic science again, and for five years concentrated on <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>creating Mathematica</a> and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. But in 1991 I took the tools I’d built, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>again immersed myself in basic science</a>. The decade that followed brought a long string of exciting and unexpected discoveries about the computational universe and its implications—leading finally in 2002 to the publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is a very complete book—that in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/colophon/'>its 1280 pages</a> does well at “answering all the obvious questions”, save, notably, for some about the “application area” of fundamental physics. For a couple of years after the book was published, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#please-dont-do-that-project'>I continued to explore some of these remaining questions</a>. But pretty soon I was swept up in the building of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> and then the Wolfram Language, and in all the complicated and often deep questions involved in for the first time creating a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>full-scale computational language</a>. And so for nearly 17 years I did almost no basic science. </p>\n<p>The ideas of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> nevertheless continued to exert a deep influence—and I came to see my decades of work on computational language as ultimately being about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/'>creating a bridge</a> between the vast capabilities of the computational universe revealed by <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and the specific kinds of ways we humans are able to think about things. This point of view led me to all kinds of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>important conclusions</a> about the role of computation and its implications for the future. But through all this I kept on thinking that one day I should look at physics again. And finally in 2019, stimulated by a small technical breakthrough, as well as enthusiasm from physicists of a new generation, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>I decided it was time to try diving into physics again</a>.</p>\n<p>My <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/'>practical tools</a> had developed a lot since I’d worked on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And—as I have found so often—the passage of years had given me greater clarity and perspective about what I’d discovered in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And it turned out we were rather quickly able to make spectacular progress. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> had <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>introduced definite ideas about how fundamental physics might work</a>. Now we could see that these ideas were very much on the right track, but on their own they did not go far enough. Something else was needed. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d introduced what I called <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a>, but I’d treated them as a kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-11--uniqueness-and-branching-in-time'>sideshow</a>. Now—particularly <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>tipped off by quantum mechanics</a>—we realized that multiway systems were not a sideshow but were actually in a sense the main event. They had come out of the computational paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, but they were really harbingers of a new paradigm: the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I’d already talked about space—and everything else in the universe—ultimately being <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-7--space-as-a-network'>made up of a network of discrete elements</a> that I’d now call “atoms of space”. And I’d talked about time being associated with the inexorable progressive application of computationally irreducible rules. But now we were thinking not just of a single thread of computation, but instead of a whole multiway system of branching and merging threads—representing in effect a multicomputational history for the universe. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d devoted a whole chapter to “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>Processes of Perception and Analysis</a>”, recognizing the importance of the observer in computational systems. But with multicomputation there was yet more focus on this, and on how a physical observer knits things together to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>form a coherent thread of experience</a>. Indeed, it became clear that it’s certain features of the observer that ultimately determine the laws of physics we perceive. And in particular it seems that as soon as we—somehow reflecting core <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>features of our conscious experience</a>—believe that we exist persistently through time, but are computationally bounded, then it follows that we will attribute to the universe the central known laws of spacetime and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>At the level of atoms of space and individual threads of history everything is full of computational irreducibility. But the key point is that observers like us don’t experience this; instead we sample certain computationally reducible features—that we can describe in terms of meaningful “laws of physics”.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/1-inset-phyzA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"163\" height=\"134\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>I never expected it would be so easy, but by early 2020—only a few months into our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>—we seemed to have successfully identified how the “machine code” of our universe must work. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> had established that computation was a powerful way of thinking about things. But now it was becoming clear that actually our whole universe is in a sense “computational all the way down”. </p>\n<p>But where did this leave the traditional mathematical view? To my surprise, far from being at odds it seemed as if our computation-all-the-way-down model of physics perfectly plugged into a great many of the more abstract existing mathematical approaches. Mediated by multicomputation, the concepts of <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>which began as an effort to go beyond mathematics—seemed now to be finding a kind of ultimate convergence with mathematics.</p>\n<p>But despite our success in working out the structure of the “machine code” for our universe, a major mystery remained. Let’s say we could find a particular rule that could generate everything in our universe. Then we’d have to ask “Why this rule, and not another?” And if “our rule” was simple, how come we’d “lucked out” like that? Ever since I was working on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/09/my-hobby-hunting-for-our-universe/'>wondered about this</a>.</p>\n<p>And just as we were getting ready to announce the Physics Project in May 2020 the answer <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#why-this-universe-the-relativity-of-rules'>began to emerge</a>. It came out of the multicomputational paradigm. And in a sense it was an ultimate version of it. Instead of imagining that the universe follows some particular rule—albeit applying it multicomputationally in all possible ways—what if the universe follows all possible rules? </p>\n<p>And then we realized: this is something much more general than physics. And in a sense it’s the ultimate computational construct. It’s what one gets if one takes all the programs in the computational universe that I studied in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and runs them together—as a single, giant, multicomputational system. It’s a single, unique object that I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, formed as the entangled limit of all possible computations.</p>\n<p>There’s no choice about the ruliad. Everything about it is abstractly necessary—emerging as it does just from the formal concept of computation. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> developed the abstraction of thinking about things in terms of computation. The ruliad takes this to its ultimate limit—capturing the whole entangled structure of all possible computations—and defining an object that in some sense describes everything.</p>\n<p>Once we believe—as the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies—that things like our universe are computational, it then inevitably follows that they are described by the ruliad. But the observer has a crucial role here. Because while as a matter of theoretical science we can discuss the whole ruliad, our experience of it inevitably has to be based on sampling it according to our actual capabilities of perception.</p>\n<p>In the end, it’s deeply analogous to something that—as <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>I mention in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>—first got me interested in fundamental questions in science 50 years ago: the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>. The molecules in a gas move around and interact according to certain rules. But as <em>A New Kind of Science</em> argues, one can think about this as a computational process, which can show computational irreducibility. If one didn’t worry about the “mechanics” of the observer, one might imagine that one could readily “see through” this computational irreducibility, to the detailed behavior of the molecules underneath. But the point is that a realistic, computationally bounded observer—like us—will be forced by computational irreducibility to perceive only certain “coarse-grained” aspects of what’s going on, and so will consider the gas to be behaving in a standard large-scale thermodynamic way. </p>\n<p>And so it is, at a grander level, with the ruliad. Observers like us can only perceive certain aspects of what’s going on in the ruliad, and a key result of our Physics Project is that with only quite loose constraints on what we’re like as observers, it’s inevitable that we will perceive our universe to operate according to particular precise known laws of physics. And indeed the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>attributes that we associate with “consciousness”</a> seem closely tied to what’s needed to get the features of spacetime and quantum mechanics that we know from physics. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> one of the conclusions is that the Principle of Computational Equivalence <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>implies a fundamental equivalence between systems (like us)</a> that we consider “intelligent” or “conscious”, and systems that we consider “merely computational”. </p>\n<p>But what’s now become clear in the multicomputational paradigm is that there’s more to this story. It’s not (as people have often assumed) that there’s something more powerful about “conscious observers” like us. Actually, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>it&#8217;s rather the opposite</a>: that in order to have consistent “conscious experience” we have to have certain limitations (in particular, computational boundedness, and a belief of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>persistence in time</a>), and these limitations are what make us “see the ruliad” in the way that corresponds to our usual view of the physical world.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 7px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/2-inset-ultimate-universe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"131\" height=\"117\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad is a powerful one, with implications that significantly transcend the traditional boundaries of science. For example, last year I realized that thinking in terms of the ruliad potentially provides a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>meaningful answer to the ultimate question of why our universe exists</a>. The answer, I posit, is that the ruliad—as a “purely formal” object—“necessarily exists”. And what we perceive as “our universe” is then just the “slice” that corresponds to what we can “see” from the particular place in “rulial space” at which we happen to be. There has to be “something there”—and the remarkable fact is that for an observer with our general characteristics, that something has to have features that are like our usual laws of physics.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I discussed how the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>almost any system can be thought of as being “like a mind”</a> (as in, “the weather has a mind of its own”). But the issue—that for example is of central importance in talking about extraterrestrial intelligence—is how similar to us that mind is. And now with the ruliad we have a more definite way to discuss this. Different minds (even different human ones) can be thought of as being at different places in the ruliad, and thus in effect attributing different rules to the universe. The Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that there must ultimately be a way to translate (or, in effect, move) from one place to another. But the question is how far it is. </p>\n<p>Our senses and measuring devices—together with our general paradigms for thinking about things—define the basic area over which our understanding extends, and for which we can readily produce a high-level narrative description of what’s going on. And in the past we might have assumed that this was all we’d ever need to reach with whatever science we built. But what <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>and now the ruliad—show us is that there’s much more out there. There’s a whole computational universe of possible programs—many of which behave in ways that are far from our current domain of high-level understanding.</p>\n<p>Traditional science we can view as operating by gradually expanding our domain of understanding. But in a sense the key methodological idea that launched <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is to do computational experiments, which in effect just “jump without prior understanding” out into the wilds of the computational universe. And that’s in the end why <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>all that ruliology</a> in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> at first looks so alien: we’ve effectively jumped quite far from our familiar place in rulial space, so there’s no reason to expect we’ll recognize anything. And in effect, as the title of the book says, we need to be doing a new kind of science.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, an important part of the story has to do with the phenomenon of computational irreducibility, and the way in which it prevents any computationally bounded observer (like us) from being able to “reduce” the behavior of systems, and thereby perceive them as anything other than complex. But now that we’re thinking not just about computation, but about multicomputation, other attributes of other observers start to be important too. And with the ruliad ultimately representing everything, the question of what will be perceived in any particular case devolves into one about the characteristics of observers.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I give examples of how the same kinds of simple programs (such as cellular automata) can <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>provide good “metamodels” for a variety of kinds of systems</a> in nature and elsewhere, that show up in very different areas of science. But one feature of different areas of science is that they’re often concerned with different kinds of questions. And with the focus on the characteristics of the observer this is something we get to capture—and we get to discuss, for example, what the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemical observer</a>, or the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economic observer</a>, might be like, and how that affects their perception of what’s ultimately in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Chapter 12 of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> there’s a long section on “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-9--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations'>Implications for Mathematics and Its Foundations</a>”, which begins with the observation that just as many models in science seem to be able to start from simple rules, mathematics is traditionally specifically set up to start from simple axioms. I then analyzed how <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>multiway systems could be thought of as defining possible derivations</a> (or proofs) of new mathematical theorems from axioms or other theorems—and I discussed how the difficulty of doing mathematics can be thought of as a reflection of computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-inset-metamath-project.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"123\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But informed by our Physics Project I realized that there&#8217;s much more to say about the foundations of mathematics—and this has led to our recently launched <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>Metamathematics Project</a>. At the core of this project is the idea that mathematics, like physics, is ultimately just a sampling of the ruliad. And just as the ruliad defines the lowest-level machine code of physics, so does it also for mathematics.</p>\n<p>The traditional axiomatic level of mathematics (with its built-in notions of variables and operators and so on) is already higher level than the “raw ruliad”. And a crucial observation is that just like physical observers operate at a level far above things like the atoms of space, so “mathematical observers” mostly operate at a level far above the raw ruliad, or even the “assembly code” of axioms. In an analogy with gases, the ruliad—or even axiom systems—are talking about the “molecular dynamics” level; but “mathematical observers” operate more at the “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>And the result of this is what I call the physicalization of metamathematics: the realization that our “perception” of mathematics is like our perception of physics. And that, for example, the very possibility of consistently doing higher-level mathematics where we don&#8217;t always have to drop down to the level of axioms or the raw ruliad has the same origin as the fact that “observers like us” typically view space as something continuous, rather than something made up of lots of atoms of space.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p815--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>considered it a mystery</a> why phenomena like undecidability are not more common in typical pure mathematics. But now our Metamathematics Project provides an answer that&#8217;s based on the character of mathematical observers. </p>\n<p>My stated goal at the beginning of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was to go beyond the mathematical paradigm, and that&#8217;s exactly what was achieved. But now there&#8217;s almost a full circle—because we see that building on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and the computational paradigm we reach the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, and then we realize that mathematics, like physics, is part of the ruliad. Or, put another way, mathematics, like physics—and like everything else—is “made of computation”, and all computation is in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>And that means that insofar as we consider there to be physical reality, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>so also we must consider there to be “mathematical reality”</a>. Physical reality arises from the sampling of the ruliad by physical observers; so similarly mathematical reality must arise from the sampling of the ruliad by mathematical observers. Or, in other words, if we believe that the physical world exists, so we must—essentially like Plato—also believe that the mathematics exists, and that there is an underlying reality to mathematics.</p>\n<p>All of these ideas rest on what was achieved in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> but now go significantly beyond it. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#the-lost-epilog,-and-other-outtakes-from-the-book'>In an “Epilog” that I eventually cut</a> from the final version of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I speculated that “major new directions” might be built in 15–30 years. And when I wrote that, I wasn&#8217;t really expecting that I would be the one to be central in doing that. And indeed I suspect that had I simply continued the direct path in basic science defined by my work on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, it wouldn&#8217;t have been me. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve explicitly planned, but at this point I can look back on my life so far and see it as a repeated alternation between <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>technology</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>basic science</a>. Each builds on the other, giving me both ideas and tools—and creating in the end a taller and taller intellectual tower. But what&#8217;s crucial is that every alternation is in many ways a fresh start, where I&#8217;m able to use what I&#8217;ve done before, but have a chance to reexamine everything from a new perspective. And so it has been in the past few years with <em>A New Kind of Science</em>: having returned to basic science after 17 years away, it&#8217;s been possible to make remarkably rapid and dramatic progress that&#8217;s taken things to a new and wholly unexpected level. </p>\n<h2 id='the-arrival-of-a-fourth-scientific-paradigm'>The Arrival of a Fourth Scientific Paradigm</h2>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/4-inset-opening-sentence.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"124\" height=\"149\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In the course of intellectual history, there’ve been <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>very few fundamentally different paradigms</a> introduced for theoretical science. The first is what one might call the “structural paradigm”, in which one’s basically just concerned with what things are made of. And beginning in antiquity—and continuing for two millennia—this was pretty much the only paradigm on offer. But in the 1600s there was, as I described it in the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>opening sentence of<em> A New Kind of Science</a></em>, a “dramatic new idea”—that one could describe not just how things are, but also what they can do, in terms of mathematical equations.</p>\n<p>And for three centuries this “mathematical paradigm” defined the state of the art for theoretical science. But as I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>went on to explain in the opening paragraph of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, my goal was to develop a new “computational paradigm” that would describe things not in terms of mathematical equations but instead in terms of computational rules or programs. There’d been <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-1--the-foundations-for-a-new-kind-of-science#sect-1-4--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book'>precursors to this in my own work in the 1980s</a>, but despite the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>practical use of computers in applying the mathematical paradigm</a>, there wasn’t much of a concept of describing things, say in nature, in a fundamentally computational way.</p>\n<p>One feature of a mathematical equation is that it aims to encapsulate “in one fell swoop” the whole behavior of a system. Solve the equation and you’ll know everything about what the system will do. But in the computational paradigm it’s a different story. The underlying computational rules for a system in principle determine what it will do. But to actually find out what it does, you have to run those rules—which is often a computationally irreducible process. </p>\n<p>Put another way: in the structural paradigm, one doesn’t talk about time at all. In the mathematical paradigm, time is there, but it’s basically just a parameter, that if you can solve the equations you can set to whatever value you want. In the computational paradigm, however, time is something more fundamental: it’s associated with the actual irreducible progression of computation in a system.</p>\n<p>It’s an important distinction that cuts to the core of theoretical science. Heavily influenced by the mathematical paradigm, it’s often been assumed that science is fundamentally about being able to make predictions, or in a sense having a model that can “outrun” the system you’re studying, and say what it’s going to do with much less computational effort than the system itself. </p>\n<p>But <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> implies that there’s a fundamental limit to this. There are systems whose behavior is in effect “too complex” for us to ever be able to “find a formula for it”. And this is not something we could, for example, resolve just by increasing our mathematical sophistication: it is a fundamental limit that arises from the whole structure of the computational paradigm. In effect, from deep inside science we’re learning that there are <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-12--historical-perspectives'>fundamental limitations on what science can achieve</a>.</p>\n<p>But as I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-7--the-phenomenon-of-free-will'>mentioned in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, computational irreducibility has an upside as well. If everything were computationally reducible, the passage of time wouldn’t in any fundamental sense add up to anything; we’d always be able to “jump ahead” and see what the outcome of anything would be without going through the steps, and we’d never have something we could reasonably experience as free will.</p>\n<p>In practical computing it’s pretty common to want to go straight from “question” to “answer”, and not be interested in “what happened inside”. But in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> there is in a sense an immediate emphasis on “what happens inside”. I don’t just show the initial input and final output for a cellular automaton. I show its whole “spacetime” history. And now that we have a computational theory of fundamental physics we can see that all the richness of our physical experience is contained in the “process inside”. We don’t just want to know the endpoint of the universe; we want to live the ongoing computational process that corresponds to our experience of the passage of time.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/5-inset-multicomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"144\" height=\"128\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But, OK, so in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> we reached what we might identify as the third major paradigm for theoretical science. But the exciting—and surprising—thing is that inspired by our Physics Project we can now <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>see a fourth paradigm: the multicomputational paradigm</a>. And while the computational paradigm involves considering the progression of particular computations, the multicomputational paradigm involves considering the entangled progression of many computations. The computational paradigm involves a single thread of time. The multicomputational paradigm involves multiple threads of time that branch and merge.</p>\n<p>What in a sense forced us into the multicomputational paradigm was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>thinking about quantum mechanics in our Physics Project</a>, and realizing that multicomputation was inevitable in our models. But the idea of multicomputation is vastly more general, and in fact immediately applies to any system where at any given step multiple things can happen. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I studied many kinds of computational systems—like cellular automata and Turing machines—where one definite thing happens at each step. I looked a little at <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a>—primarily ones based on string rewriting. But now in general in the multicomputational paradigm one is interested in studying multiway systems of all kinds. They can be based on simple iterations, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>say involving numbers</a>, in which multiple functions can be applied at each step. They can be based on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#he-topology-of-proof-space'>systems like games</a> where there are multiple moves at each step. And they can be based on a whole range of systems in nature, technology and elsewhere where there are multiple <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/#asynchronous-updating'>“asynchronous” choices of events</a> that can occur.</p>\n<p>Given the basic description of multicomputational systems, one might at first assume that whatever difficulties there are in deducing the behavior of computational systems, they would only be greater for multicomputational systems. But the crucial point is that whereas with a purely computational system (like a cellular automaton) it’s perfectly reasonable to imagine “experiencing” its whole evolution—say just by seeing a picture of it, the same is not true of a multicomputational system. Because for observers like us, who fundamentally experience time in a single thread, we have no choice but to somehow “sample” or “coarse grain” a multicomputational system if we are to reduce its behavior to something we can “experience”. </p>\n<p>And there’s then a remarkable formal fact: if one has a system that shows fundamental computational irreducibility, then computationally bounded “single-thread-of-time” observers inevitably perceive certain effective behavior in the system, that follows something like the typical laws of physics. Once again we can make an analogy with gases made from large numbers of molecules. Large-scale (computationally bounded) observers will essentially inevitably perceive gases to follow, say, the standard gas laws, quite independent of the detailed properties of individual molecules. </p>\n<p>In other words, the interplay between an “observer like us” and a multicomputational system will effectively select out a slice of computational reducibility from the underlying computational irreducibility. And although I didn’t see this coming, it’s in the end fairly obvious that something like this has to happen. The Principle of Computational Equivalence makes it basically inevitable that the underlying processes in the universe will be computationally irreducible. But somehow the particular features of the universe that we perceive and care about have to be ones that have enough computational reducibility that we can, for example, make consistent decisions about what to do, and we’re not just continually confronted by irreducible unpredictability.</p>\n<p>So how general can we expect this picture of multicomputation to be, with its connection to the kinds of things we’ve seen in physics? It seems to be extremely general, and to provide a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>true fourth paradigm for theoretical science</a>. </p>\n<p>There are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>many kinds of systems</a> for which the multicomputational paradigm seems to be immediately relevant. Beyond physics and metamathematics, there seems to be near-term promise in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemistry</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular biology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#evolutionary-biology'>evolutionary biology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#neuroscience'>neuroscience</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#immunology'>immunology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics'>linguistics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#machine-learning'>machine learning</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#distributed-computing'>distributed computing</a> and more. In each case there are underlying low-level elements (such as molecules) that interact through some kind of events (say collisions or reactions). And then there’s a big question of what the relevant observer is like.</p>\n<p>In <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemistry</a>, for example, the observer could just measure the overall concentration of some kind of molecule, coarse-graining together all the individual instances of those molecules. Or the observer could be sensitive, for example, to detailed causal relationships between collisions among molecules. In traditional chemistry, things like this generally aren’t “observed”. But in biology (for example in connection with membranes), or in molecular computing, they may be crucial. </p>\n<p>When I began the project that became <em>A New Kind of Science</em> the central question I wanted to answer is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>why we see so much complexity</a> in so many kinds of systems. And with the computational paradigm and the ubiquity of computational irreducibility we had an answer, which also in a sense told us why it was difficult to make certain kinds of progress in a whole range of areas.</p>\n<p>But now we’ve got a new paradigm, the multicomputational paradigm. And the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#multicomputation-and-the-surprise-return-of-reducibility-'>big surprise</a> is that through the intermediation of the observer we can tap into computational reducibility, and potentially find “physics-like” laws for all sorts of fields. This may not work for the questions that have traditionally been asked in these fields. But the point is that with the “right kind of observer” there’s computational reducibility to be found. And that computational reducibility may be something we can tap into for understanding, or to use some kind of system for technology.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/6-inset-ruliad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"121\" height=\"126\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>It can all be seen as starting with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, and involving almost philosophical questions of what one can call “observer theory”. But in the end it gives us very practical ideas and methods that I think have the potential to lead to unexpectedly dramatic progress in a remarkable range of fields.</p>\n<p>I knew that <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would have practical applications, particularly in modeling, in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#a-world-of-discovered-technology'>technology</a> and in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/music-mathematica-and-the-computational-universe/'>producing creative material</a>. And indeed it has. But for our Physics Project applications seemed much further away, perhaps centuries. But a great surprise has been that through the multicomputational paradigm it seems as if there are going to be some quite immediate and very practical applications of the Physics Project.</p>\n<p>In a sense the reason for this is that through the intermediation of multicomputation we see that many kinds of systems share the same underlying “metastructure”. And this means that as soon as there are things to say about one kind of system these can be applied to other systems. And in particular the great successes of physics can be applied to a whole range of systems that share the same multicomputational metastructure.</p>\n<p>An immediate example is in practical computing, and particularly in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. It’s something of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#the-beginning-of-the-story'>personal irony</a> that the Wolfram Language is based on transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which is a structure very similar to what ends up being what’s involved in the Physics Project. But there’s a crucial difference: in the usual case of the Wolfram Language, everything works in a purely computational way, with a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#the-question-of-evaluation-order'>particular transformation being done at each step</a>. But now there’s the potential to generalize that to the multicomputational case, and in effect to trace the multiway system of every possible transformation.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to pick out of that structure things that we can readily understand. But there are important lessons from physics for this. And as we build out the multicomputational capabilities of the Wolfram Language I fully expect that the “notational clarity” it will bring will help us to formulate much more in terms of the multicomputational paradigm.</p>\n<p>I built the Wolfram Language as a tool that would help me explore the computational paradigm, and from that paradigm there emerged principles like the Principle of Computational Equivalence, which in turn led me to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2009/05/7-years-of-nks-and-its-first-killer-app/'>see the possibility</a> of something like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>. But now from the latest basic science built on the foundations of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, together with the practical tooling of the Wolfram Language, it’s becoming possible again to see how to make conceptual advances that can drive technology that will again in turn let us make—likely dramatic—progress in basic science. </p>\n<h2 id='harvesting-seeds-from-a-new-kind-of-science'>Harvesting Seeds from A New Kind of Science</h2>\n<p><em>A New Kind of Science</em> is full of intellectual seeds. And in the past few years—having now returned to basic science—I’ve been harvesting a few of those seeds. The <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> and the Metamathematics Project are two major results. But there’s been quite a bit more. And in fact it’s rather remarkable how many things that were barely more than footnotes in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/new-kind-of-science/'>turned into major projects</a>, with important results.</p>\n<p>Back in 2018—a year before beginning the Physics Project—I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>returned, for example,</a> to what’s become known as the Wolfram Axiom: the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p808--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>axiom that I found in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> that is the very simplest possible axiom for Boolean algebra. But my focus now was not so much on the axiom itself as on the automated process of proving its correctness, and the effort to see the relation between “pure computation” and what one might consider a human-absorbable “narrative proof”.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility appeared many times, notably in my efforts to understand <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>AI ethics</a> and the implications of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>computational contracts</a>. I’ve no doubt that in the years to come, the concept of computational irreducibility will become increasingly important in everyday thinking—a bit like how concepts such as energy and momentum from the mathematical paradigm have become important. And in 2019, for example, computational irreducibility made an <a href='https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/6/optimizing-for-engagement-understanding-the-use-of-persuasive-technology-on-internet-platforms' target=_blank rel=noopener>appearance in government affairs</a>, as a result of me <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/testifying-at-the-senate-about-a-i-selected-content-on-the-internet/'>testifying about its implications for legislation about AI selection</a> of content on the internet.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I explored many specific systems about which one can ask all sorts of questions. And one might think that after 20 years “all the obvious questions” would have been answered. But they have not. And in a sense the fact that they have not is a direct reflection of the ubiquity of computational irreducibility. But it’s a fundamental feature that whenever there’s computational irreducibility, there must also be pockets of computational reducibility: in other words, the very existence of computational irreducibility implies an infinite frontier of potential progress. </p>\n<p>Back in 2007, we’d had great success with our <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/'>Turing Machine Prize</a>, and the Turing machine that I’d suspected was the very simplest possible universal Turing machine was <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2007/10/24/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/'>indeed proved universal</a>—providing another piece of evidence for the Principle of Computational Equivalence. And in a sense there’s a general question that’s raised by <em>A New Kind of Science</em> about where the threshold of universality—or computational equivalence—really is in different kinds of systems.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-left: 8px; margin-top: 2px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/7-inset-rule30prize.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"140\" height=\"116\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But there are simpler-to-define questions as well. And ever since I <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf'>first studied rule 30</a> in 1984 I’d wondered about many questions related to it. And in October 2019 I decided to launch the <a href='https://www.rule30prize.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Rule 30 Prizes</a>, defining <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>three specific easy-to-state questions about rule 30</a>. So far I don’t know of progress on them. And for all I know they’ll be open problems for centuries. From the point of view of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a> we can think of them as distant explorations in rulial space, and the question of when they can be answered is like the question of when we’ll have the technology to get to some distant place in physical space.</p>\n<p>Having launched the Physics Project in April 2020, it was rapidly clear that its ideas could also be applied to metamathematics. And it even seemed as if it might be easier to make relevant “real-world” observations in metamathematics than in physics. And the seed for this was in a note in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> entitled “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--empirical-metamathematics/'>Empirical Metamathematics</a>”. That note contained one picture of the theorem-dependency graph of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, which in the summer of 2020 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>expanded into a 70-page study</a>. And in my recent “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>Physicalization of Metamathematics</a>” there’s a continuation of that—beginning to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#empirical-metamathematics'>map out empirical metamathematical space</a>, as explored in the practice of mathematics, with the idea that multicomputational phenomena that in physics may take technically infeasible particle accelerators or telescopes might actually be within reach.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/8-inset-combinators.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"142\" height=\"139\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In addition to being the year we launched our Physics Project, 2020 was also the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/'>100th anniversary of combinators</a>—the first concrete formalization of universal computation. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I devoted a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p711--universality-in-turing-machines-and-other-systems/'>few pages</a> and some <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-11-12--combinators/'>notes</a> to combinators, but I decided to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>do a deep dive</a> and use both what I’d learned from <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and from the Physics Project to take a new look at them. Among other things the result was another <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#updating-schemes-and-multiway-systems'>application of multicomputation</a>, as well as the realization that even though the S, K combinators from 1920 seemed very minimal, it was possible that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/06/1920-2020-and-a-20000-prize-announcing-the-s-combinator-challenge/'>S alone might also be universal</a>, though with something different than the usual input &#8594; output “workflow” of computation. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science </em>a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-5-6--non-deterministic-systems/'>single footnote mentions multiway Turing machines</a>. And early last year I turned this seed into a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/02/multiway-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>long and detailed study</a> that provides further foundational examples of multicomputation, and explores the question of just what it means to “do a computation” multicomputationally—something which I believe is highly relevant not only for practical distributed computing but also for things like molecular computing.</p>\n<p>In 2021 it was the <a href='https://youtu.be/ultMxODJE7o' target=_blank rel=noopener>centenary of Post tag systems</a>, and again I turned a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-7--tag-systems'>few pages in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> into a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/'>long and detailed study</a>. And what’s important about both this and my study of combinators is that they provide foundational examples (much like cellular automata in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>), which even in the past year or so I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>used multiple times</a> in different projects.</p>\n<p>In mid-2021, yet another <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p339--origins-of-discreteness/'>few-page discussion in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> turned into a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/'>detailed study of “The Problem of Distributed Consensus”</a>. And once again, this turned out to have a multicomputational angle, at first in understanding the multiway character of possible outcomes, but later with the realization that the formation of consensus is deeply related to the process of measurement and the coarse-graining involved in it—and the fundamental way that observers extract “coherent experiences” from systems.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, there’s a short note about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-5-6--multiway-systems-based-on-numbers/'>multiway systems based on numbers</a>. And once again, in fall 2021 I expanded on this to produce an <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems/' target=_blank rel=noopener>extensive study of such systems</a>, as a certain kind of very minimal example of multicomputation, that at least in some cases connects with traditional mathematical ideas.</p>\n<p>From the vantage point of multicomputation and our Physics Project it’s interesting to look back at <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and see some of what it describes with more clarity. In the fall of 2021, for example, I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>reviewed what had become of the original goal of &#8220;understanding complexity&#8221;</a>, and what methodological ideas had emerged from that effort. I identified two primary ones, which I called “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>” and “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#metamodeling-and-the-metatheory-of-models'>metamodeling</a>”. Ruliology, as I’ve mentioned above, is my new name for the pure, basic science of studying the behavior of systems with simple rules: in effect, it’s the science of exploring the computational universe.</p>\n<p>Metamodeling is the key to making connections to systems in nature and elsewhere that one wants to study. Its goal is to find the “minimal models for models”. Often there are existing models for systems. But the question is what the ultimate essence of those models is. Can everything be reduced to a cellular automaton? Or a multiway system? What is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-1--issues-of-modelling'>minimal &#8220;computational essence&#8221; of a system</a>? And as we begin to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>apply the multicomputational paradigm to different fields</a>, a key step will be metamodeling. </p>\n<p>Ruliology and metamodeling are in a sense already core concepts in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, though not under those names. Observer theory is much less explicitly covered. And many concepts—like <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graphs</a>, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-relationship-between-graphs-and-the-multiway-causal-graph/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multiway causal graph</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>—have only emerged now, with the Physics Project and the arrival of the multicomputational paradigm. </p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>Multicomputation</a>, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> and the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>Metamathematics Project</a> are sowing their own seeds. But there are still many more seeds to harvest even from <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And just as the multicomputational paradigm was not something that I, for one, could foresee from <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, no doubt there will in time be other major new directions that will emerge. But, needless to say, one should expect that it will be computationally irreducible to determine what will happen: a metacontribution of the science to the consideration of its own future. </p>\n<h2 id='the-doing-of-science'>The Doing of Science</h2>\n<p>The creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>took me a decade of intense work</a>, none of which saw the light of day until the moment the book was published on May 14, 2002. Returning to basic science 17 years later the world had changed and it was possible for me to adopt a quite different approach, in a sense making the process of doing science as open and incremental as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/9-inset-wolfram-language.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" height=\"126\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s helped that there’s the web, <a href='https://wolframcloud.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>the cloud</a> and <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/livestreams'>livestreaming</a>. But in a sense the most crucial element has been the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>, and its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>character as a full-scale computational language</a>. Yes, I use English to tell the story of what we’re doing. But fundamentally I’m doing science in the Wolfram Language, using it both as a practical tool, and as a medium for organizing my thoughts, and sharing and communicating what I’m doing.</p>\n<p>Starting in 2003, we’ve had an annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Wolfram Summer School</a> at which a long string of talented students have explored ideas based on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, always through the medium of the Wolfram Language. In the last couple of years we’ve added a <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school/programs/physics/'>Physics track</a>, connected to the Physics Project, and this year we’re adding a Metamathematics track, connected to the Metamathematics Project.</p>\n<p>During the 17 years that I wasn’t focused on basic science, I was doing technology development. And I think it’s fair to say that at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a> over the past 35 years we’ve created a remarkably effective “machine” for doing innovative research and development. Mostly it’s been producing <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/technologies'>technology</a> and <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/products'>products</a>. But one of the very interesting features of the Physics Project and the projects that have followed it is that we’ve been applying the same managed approach to innovation to them that we have been using so successfully for so many years at our company. And I consider the results to be quite spectacular: in a matter of weeks or months I think we’ve managed to deliver what might otherwise have taken years, if it could have been done at all. </p>\n<p>And particularly with the arrival of the multicomputational paradigm there’s quite a challenge. There are a huge number of exceptionally promising directions to follow, that have the potential to deliver revolutionary results. And with our concepts of managed research, open science and broad connection to talent it should be possible to make great progress even fairly quickly. But to do so requires significant scaling up of our efforts so far, which is why we’re now <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/04/weve-got-a-science-opportunity-overload-its-time-to-launch-the-wolfram-institute/'>launching the Wolfram Institute</a> to serve as a focal point for these efforts.</p>\n<p>When I think about <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I can’t help but be struck by all the things that had to align to make it possible. My early experiences in science and technology, the personal environment I’d created—and the tools I built. I wondered at the time whether the five years I took “away from basic science” to <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>launch Mathematica</a> and what’s now the Wolfram Language might have slowed down what became <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. Looking back I can say that the answer was definitively no. Because without the Wolfram Language the creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would have needed “not just a decade”, but likely more than a lifetime. </p>\n<p>And a similar pattern has repeated now, though even more so. The Physics Project and everything that has developed from it has been made possible by a tower of specific circumstances that stretch back nearly half a century—including my 17-year hiatus from basic science. Had all these circumstances not aligned, it is hard to say when something like the Physics Project would have happened, but my guess is that it would have been at least a significant part of a century away. </p>\n<p>It is a lesson of the history of science that the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/05/living-a-paradigm-shift-looking-back-on-reactions-to-a-new-kind-of-science/'>absorption of major new paradigms</a> is a slow process. And normally the timescales are long compared to the 20 years since <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was published. But in a sense we’ve managed to jump far ahead of schedule with the Physics Project and with the development of the multicomputational paradigm. Five years ago, when I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/'>summarized the first 15 years of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> I had no idea that any of this would happen. </p>\n<p>But now that it has—and with all the methodology we’ve developed for getting science done—it feels as if we have a certain obligation to see just what can be achieved. And to see just what can be built in the years to come on the foundations laid down by <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. </p>\n",

Almost every day of my thirties, and a little beyond, I tenaciously worked on it. Figuring out more and more science. Developing new kinds of computational diagrams. Crafting an exposition that I wrote and rewrote to make as clear as possible. And painstakingly laying out page after page of what on May 14, 2002, would be published as <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>.</p>\n<p>I’ve written before (even <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>in the book itself</a>) about the intellectual journey involved in the creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. But here I want to share some of the more practical “behind the scenes” journey of the making of what I and others usually now call simply “the NKS book”. Some of what I’ll talk about happened twenty years ago, some more like thirty years ago. And it’s been interesting to go back into my archives (and, yes, those backup tapes from 30 years ago were hard to read!) and relive some of what finally led to the delivery of the ideas and results of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> as truckloads of elegantly printed books with striking covers.<span id=\"more-36459\"></span></p>\n<p>It was late 1989—soon after my 30th birthday—when I decided to embark on what would become <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And at first my objective was quite modest: I just wanted to write a book to summarize the science I’d developed earlier in the 1980s. <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>We&#8217;d released Version 1.0</a> of <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> (and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>) in June 1988, and to accompany that release I’d written what had rapidly become a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>very successful book</a>. And while I’d basically built Mathematica to give me the opportunity to do more science, my thought in late 1989 was that before seriously embarking on that, I should spend perhaps a year and write a book about what I already knew, and perhaps tie up a few loose ends in the process.</p>\n<p>My journey in science began in the early 1970s—and by the time I was 14 I’d already written <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/early-books/'>three book-length &#8220;treatises&#8221; about physics</a> (though these wouldn’t see the light of day for several more decades). I worked purely on physics for a number of years, but in 1979 this led me into my <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/smp-symbolic-manipulation-program/'>first big adventure in technology</a>—thereby starting my (very productive) long-term personal pattern of alternating between science and technology (roughly five times so far). In the early 1980s—back in a “science phase”—I was fortunate enough to make what remains my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>all-time favorite science discovery</a>: that in cellular automaton programs even with extremely simple rules it’s possible to generate immense complexity. And from this discovery I was led to a series of results that began to suggest what I started calling a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>general &#8220;science of complexity&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>By the mid-1980s I was quite well positioned in the academic world, and my first thought was to try to build up the study of the “science of complexity” as an academic field. I <a href='https://www.complex-systems.com/'>started a journal</a> and a research center, and collected my papers in a book entitled <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1986-a-first-collection-of-cellular-automaton-papers/'>Theory and Applications of Cellular Automata</a></em> (later reissued as <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>Cellular Automata and Complexity</a></em>). But things developed slowly, and eventually I decided to go to “plan B”—and just try to create the tools and environment that I would need to personally push forward the science as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>The result was that in late 1986 I started the development of Mathematica (and what’s now the Wolfram Language) and founded <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>. For several years I was completely consumed with the challenges of language design, software development and CEOing our rapidly growing company. But in August 1989 we had released <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/quick-revision-history.html'>Mathematica 1.2</a> (tying up the most obvious loose ends of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/'>Version 1.0</a>)—and with the intensity of my other commitments at least temporarily reduced, I began to think about science again. </p>\n<p><em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>The Mathematica Book</a></em> had been comparatively straightforward and fast for me to write—even as a “side project” to architecting and developing the system. And I imagined that it would be a somewhat similar experience writing a book explaining what I’d figured out about complexity.</p>\n<p>My first working title was <em>Complexity: An Introduction to the Science of Complex Phenomena</em>. My first draft of a table of contents, from November 1989, begins with “A Gallery of Complex Systems” (or “The Phenomenon of Complexity”), and continues through nine other chapters, capturing some of what I then thought would be important (and in most cases had already studied):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg2.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg2.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"402\" /></a></p>\n<p>I wrote a few pages of introductory text—beginning by stating the objective as:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"78\" /></a></p>\n<p>My archives record that in late December I was taking a more computation-first approach, and considering the title <em>Algorithms in Nature: An Introduction to Complexity</em>. But soon I was submerged in the intense effort to develop Mathematica 2.0, and this is what consumed me for most of 1990—though my archives from the time reveal one solitary short note, apparently from the middle of the year: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3-a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3-a.png\" width=\"396\" height=\"278\" /></a></p>\n<p>But through all this I kept thinking about the book I intended to write, and wondering what it should really be like. In the late 1980s there’d been quite a run of unexpectedly successful “popular science” books—like <em>A Brief History of Time</em>—that mixed what were at least often claimed to be new results or new insights about science with a kind of intended-to-entertain “everyman narrative”. A sequence of publishers had encouraged me to “write a popular science book”. But should the book I was planning to write really be one of those? </p>\n<p>I talked to quite a few authors and editors. But nobody could quite tell a coherent story. Perhaps the most promising insight came from an editor of several successful such books, who opined that he thought the main market for “popular science” books was people who in the past would have read philosophy books, but now those were too narrow and technical. Other people, though, told me they thought it was really more of an “internal market”, with the books basically being bought by other scientists. And in the media and elsewhere there continued to be an undercurrent of sentiment that while the books might be being bought, they mostly weren’t actually getting read.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t there actual data on what’s going on?” I asked my publishing industry contacts. “No”, they said, “that’s just not how our industry works”. “Well”, I said, “why don’t we collect some data?” My then-publisher seemed enthusiastic about it. So I wrote a rather extensive survey to do on “random shoppers” in bookstores. It began with some basic—if “1990-style”—demographic questions, then got to things like</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322bpplsurvey4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"801\" /></a></p>\n<p>and rather charmingly ended with</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4-a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4-a.png\" width=\"501\" height=\"396\" /></a></p>\n<p>(and, yes, in reality it took almost the longest time I could imagine for electronic books to become common). But after many months of “we’ll get results soon” it turned out almost no surveys were ever done. As I would learn repeatedly, most publishers seemed to have a very hard time doing anything they hadn’t already done before. Still, my then-publisher had done well with <em>The Mathematica Book</em>. So perhaps they might be able to just “follow a formula” and do well with my book if it was written in “popular science” form. </p>\n<p>But I quickly realized that the pressure to add sensationalism “to sell books” really grated on me. And it didn’t take long to decide that, no, I wasn’t going to write a “formula” popular science book. I was going to write my own kind of book—that was more direct and straightforward. No stories. Just science. With lots of pictures. And if nothing else, the book would at least be helpful to me, as a way of clarifying my own thinking.</p>\n<h2 id='beginning-to-tool-up'>Beginning to Tool Up</h2>\n<p>In January 1991 we announced <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1991-mathematica-2-is-released/?iframe=true'>Mathematica 2.0</a>—and in March and June I did a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1991/03/03/mathematica2-tour-thumb/?iframe=true'>35-city tour of the US and Europe</a> talking about it. Then, finally, at the beginning of July we delivered final floppy disks to the duplicator (as one did in those days)—and Mathematica 2.0 was on its way. So what next? I had a long roadmap of things we should do. But I decided it was time to let the team I’d built just get on with following the roadmap for a while, without me adding yet more things to it. (As it turns out, we finally finished essentially everything that was on my 1991 to-do list just a few years ago.)</p>\n<p>And so it was that in July 1991 I became a remote CEO (yes, a few decades ahead of the times), moved a couple thousand miles away from our company headquarters to a place in the hills near San Francisco, and set about getting ready to write. Based on the plan I had for the book—and my experience with <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>The Mathematica Book</a></em>—I figured it might take about a year, or maybe 18 months, to finish the project.</p>\n<p>In the end—with a few trips in the middle, notably to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/08/when-exactly-will-the-eclipse-happen-a-multimillenium-tale-of-computation/\">see</a> a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=total+solar+eclipse+1991'>total solar eclipse</a>—it took me a couple of months to get my remote-CEO setup figured out (with a swank computer-connected fax machine, email getting autodelivered every 15 minutes, etc.). But even while that was going on, I was tooling up to get an efficient modern system for visualizing and studying cellular automata. Back when I had been writing my <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata/'>papers in the 1980s</a>, I’d had a C program (primarily for Sun workstations) that had gradually grown, and was eventually controlled by a rather elaborate—but sensible-for-its-time—hierarchical textual menu system</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" /></a></p>\n<p>which, yes, could generate at least single-graphic-per-screen graphics, as in this picture of my 1983 office setup:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5c.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5c.png\" width=\"556\" height=\"329\" /></a></p>\n<p>But now the world had changed, and I had <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica'>Mathematica</a>. And I wanted a nice collection of Wolfram Language functions that could be used as streamlined “primitives” for studying cellular automata. Given all my work on cellular automata it might seem strange that I hadn’t built cellular automaton functionality into the Wolfram Language right from the start. But in addition to being a bit bashful about my personal pet kind of system, I hadn’t been able to see how to “package” all the various different kinds of cellular automata I’d studied into one convenient superfunction—and indeed it took me a decade more of understanding, both of language design and of cellular automata, to work out <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CellularAutomaton.html'>how to nicely do that</a>. And so back in 1991 I just created a collection of add-on functions (or what might today be a paclet) containing the particular functions I needed. And indeed those functions served me well over the course of the development of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>\n<p>A “staged” screen capture from the time shows my basic working environment:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5a.png\" width=\"503\" height=\"409\" /></a></p>\n<p>Some printouts from early 1991 give a sense of my everyday experience:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img6.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img6.png\" width=\"607\" height=\"380\" /></a></p>\n<p>And although it&#8217;s now more than 30 years later, I&#8217;m happy to say that we&#8217;ve successfully maintained the compatibility of the Wolfram Language, and those same functions still just run! The .ma format of my Version 2.0 notebooks from 1991 has <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/Developer/ref/NotebookConvert.html'>to be converted to .nb</a>, but then they just open in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/12/launching-version-13-0-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/'>Version 13</a> (with a bit of automatic style modernization) and I’m immediately “transported back in time” to 1991, with, yes, a very small notebook appropriate for a 1991 rather than a 2022 screen size: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Of course the cellular automata all look the same, but, yes, this notebook looks shockingly similar to ones from our recent <a href='https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram/status/1420206573096513539' target=_blank rel=noopener>cellular automaton NFT-minting event</a>.)</p>\n<p>We’d invented <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/'>notebooks</a> in 1987 to be able to do just the kinds of things I wanted to do for my science project—and I’d been itching to use them. But before 1991 I’d mostly been doing core code development (often in C), or using the elaborate but still textual system we had for authoring <em>The Mathematica Book</em>. And so—even though I’d demoed them many times—I hadn’t had a chance to personally make daily use of notebooks.</p>\n<p>But in 1991, I went all in on notebooks—and have never looked back. When I first started studying cellular automata back in 1981, I’d had to display their output as text. But soon I was able to start using the bitmapped displays of workstation computers, and by 1984 I was routinely printing cellular automaton images in fairly high resolution on a laser printer. But with Mathematica and our notebook technology things got dramatically more convenient—and what had previously often involved laborious work with paper, scissors and tape now became a matter of simple Wolfram Language code in a notebook.</p>\n<p>For almost a decade starting in 1982, my primary computer had been a progressively more sophisticated Sun workstation. But in 1991 I switched to NeXT—mainly to be able to use our notebook interface, which was by then <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1989/04/03/1989_mathematicaarrivesnext-2/?iframe=true'>well developed for NeXT</a> but wasn’t yet ready on X Windows and Sun. (It was also available on Macintosh computers, but at the time those weren’t powerful enough.) </p>\n<p>And here I am in 1991, captured “hiding out” as a remote CEO, with a NeXT in the background, just getting started on the book:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7a.png\" width=\"283\" height=\"193\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here’s a picture showing a bit more of the setup, taken in early 1993, during a short period when I was a remote-remote-CEO, with my computer set up in a hotel room:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img8.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img8.png\" width=\"423\" height=\"438\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id='september-1991:-beyond-cellular-automata'>September 1991: Beyond Cellular Automata</h2>\n<p>Throughout the 1980s, I’d used cellular automata—and basically cellular automata alone—as my window into the computational universe. But in August 1991—with my new computational capabilities and new away-from-the-company-to-do-science setup—I decided it’d be worth trying to look at some other systems.</p>\n<p>And I have to say that now, three decades later, I didn’t remember just how suddenly everything happened. But my filesystem records that in successive days at the beginning of September 1991 there I was investigating more and more kinds of systems (.ma’s were “Mathematica notebook” files; .mb’s were the “binary forks” of these files):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img9.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img9.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"308\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/#sect-3-3--mobile-automata'>Mobile automata</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machines</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-7--tag-systems'>Tag systems</a>. Soon these would be joined by <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-9--register-machines'>register machines</a>, and more. The first examples of these systems tended to have quite simple behavior. But I quickly started searching to see whether these systems—like cellular automata—would be capable of complex behavior, as my 1991 notebooks record:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img13a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img13a.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"618\" /></a></p>\n<p>Often I would run programs overnight, or sometimes for many days. Later I would recruit many computers from around our company, and have them send me mail about their results:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img10-v2.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img10-v2.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"237\" /></a></p>\n<p>But already in September 1991 I was starting to see that, yes, just like cellular automata, all these different kinds of systems, even when their underlying rules were simple, could <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>exhibit highly complex behavior</a>. I think I’d sort of implicitly assumed this would be true. But somehow actually seeing it began to elevate my view of just how general a “science of complexity” one might be able to make.</p>\n<p>There were a few distractions in the fall of 1991. Like in October a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_firestorm_of_1991' target=_blank rel=noopener>large fire</a> came within about half a mile of burning down our house: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img11.png\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img11.png\" width=\"359\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p>But by the spring of 1992 it was beginning to become clear that there was a very general principle around all this complexity I was seeing. I had <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/undecidability-intractability-theoretical-physics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>invented the concept of computational irreducibility</a> back in 1984. And I suppose in retrospect I should have seen the bigger picture sooner. But as it was, on a pleasant afternoon (and, no, I haven’t figured out the exact date), I was taking a short break from being in front of my computer, and had wandered outside. And that’s when the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> came to me. Somehow after all those years with cellular automata, and all those months with computer experiments on other systems, I was primed for it. But in the end it all arrived in one moment: the concept, the name, the implications for computational irreducibility. And in the three decades since, it’s been the single most important guiding principle for my intuition. </p>\n<h2 id='what-should-the-pages-look-like?'>What Should the Pages Look Like?</h2>\n<p>I’ve always found it difficult to produce “disembodied content”: right from the beginning I typically need to have a pretty clear idea how what I’m producing will look in the end. So back in 1991 I really couldn’t produce more than a page or two of content for my book without knowing what the book was going to look like.</p>\n<p>“Formula” popular science books tended—for what I later realized were largely economic reasons—to consist mainly of pages of pure text, with at most line drawings, and to concentrate whatever things like photographs they might have into a special collection of “plates” in the middle of the book. For <em>The Mathematica Book</em> we’d developed a definite—very functional—layout, with text, tables and two-column “computer dialogs”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img14.png\" width=\"612\" height=\"348\" /></a></p>\n<p>For the NKS book I knew I needed something much more visual. And at first I imagined it might be a bit like a high-end textbook, complete with all sorts of structured elements (“Historical Note”, “Methodology”, etc.). </p>\n<p>I asked a talented young designer who had worked on <em>The Mathematica Book</em> (and who, 31 years later, is now a very senior executive at our company) to see what he could come up with. And here, from November 1991, is the very first “look” for the NKS book—with content pretty much just flowed in from the few pages I’d written out in plain text:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img15.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"743\" /></a></p>\n<p>I knew the book would have images of the kind I’d long produced of cellular automata, and that had appeared in <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>my papers</a> and <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>book</a> from the 1980s:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img16.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"1128\" /></a></p>\n<p>But what about “diagrams”? At first we toyed with drawing “textbook-style” diagrams—and produced some samples:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img17a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img17a.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>\n<p>But these seemed to have way too much &#8220;conceptual baggage&#8221;, and when one looks closely at them, it&#8217;s easy to get confused. I wanted something more minimal—where the spotlight was as much as possible on the systems I was studying, not on &#8220;diagrammatic scaffolding&#8221;. And so I tried to develop a &#8220;direct diagramming&#8221; methodology, where each diagram could directly &#8220;explain itself&#8221;—and where every diagram would be readable &#8220;purely visually&#8221;, without words.</p>\n<p>In a typical case I might <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p71--mobile-automata/'>show the behavior of a system (here a mobile automaton)</a>, next to an explicit “visual template” of how its rules operate. The idea then was that even a reader who didn’t understand the bigger story, or any of the technical details, could still “match up templates” and understand what was going on in a particular picture:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img18.png\" width=\"493\" height=\"277\" /></a></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the project, the diagrams were comparatively simple. But as the project progressed I invented more and more mechanisms for them, until later in the project I was producing very <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p768--undecidability-and-intractability/'>complex &#8220;visually readable&#8221; diagrams like this</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img19.png\" width=\"548\" height=\"325\" /></a></p>\n<p>A crucial point was that all these diagrams were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--pictures-in-the-book/'>being produced algorithmically</a>—with Wolfram Language code. And in fact I was developing the diagrams as an integral part of actually doing the research for the book. It was a lesson I’d learned years earlier: don’t wait until research is “finished” to figure out how to present it; work out the presentation as early as possible, so you can use it to help you actually do the research.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of our first “textbook-like” style for the book was the idea of having additional elements, alongside the “main narrative” of the book. In early layouts we thought about having “Technical Notes”, “Historical Notes”, “Implementation Notes”, etc. But it didn’t take too long to decide that no, that was just going to be too complicated. So we made the decision to have one kind of note, and to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-for-chapters/'>collect all notes at the back of the book</a>.</p>\n<p>And that meant that in the main part of the book we had just two basic elements: text and images (with captions). But, OK, in designing any book a very basic question is: what size and shape will its pages be? <em>The Mathematica Book</em> was squarish—like a typical textbook—so that it accommodated its text-on-the-left code-on-the-right “dialogs”. We knew that the new book should be wide too, to accommodate the kinds of graphics I expected. But that posed a problem.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Mathematica Book</em> ordinary text ran the full width of the page. And that worked OK, because in that book the text was typically broken up by dialogs, tables, etc. In the new book, however, I expected much longer blocks of pure text—which wouldn’t be readable if they ran the full width of the page. But if the text was narrower, then how would the graphics not look like they were awkwardly sticking out? Well, the pages would have to be carefully laid out to appropriately anchor the graphics visually, say to the tops or bottoms of pages. And that was going to make the process of layout much trickier.</p>\n<p>Different pages were definitely going to look different. But there had to be a certain overall consistency. Every graphic was going to have a caption—and actually a caption that was sufficiently self-contained so that people could basically “read the book just by looking at the pictures”. Within the graphics themselves there had to be standards. How should arrays of cells be rendered? To what extent should things have boxes around them, or arrows between them? How big should pictures that emphasized particular features be?</p>\n<p>Some of these standards got implemented basically just by me remembering to follow them. But others were essentially the result of the whole stack of Wolfram Language functions that we built to produce the algorithmic diagrams for the book. At the time, there was some fiddliness to these functions, and to making their output look good—though in later years what we learned from this was used to tune up the general look of built-in graphics in the Wolfram Language. </p>\n<h2 id='the-technology-of-images'>The Technology of Images</h2>\n<p>One of the striking features of the NKS book is the crispness of its pictures. And I think it’s fair to say that this wasn’t easy to achieve—and in the end required a pretty deep dive into the technology of imaging and printing (as I’ll describe more in a later section).</p>\n<p>Back in the 1980s I’d had plenty of pictures of things like cellular automata in <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>my papers</a>. And I’d produced them by outputting what amounted to pages of bitmaps on laser printers, then having publishers photographically reproduce the pictures for printing.</p>\n<p>Up to a point the results were OK:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img20.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"198\" /></a></p>\n<p>But for example in 1985 when I wanted a 2000-step picture of rule 30 things got difficult. The computation (which, yes, involves 8 million cells) was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/random-sequence-generation-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>done on a prototype Connection Machine parallel computer</a>. And at first the output was generated on a large-format printer that was usually used to print integrated circuit layouts. The result was quite large, and I subsequently laminated pictures like this (and in rolled-up form they served as engaging hiding places for my children when they were very young):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img21.png\" width=\"192\" height=\"311\" /></a></p>\n<p>But when photographically reproduced and printed in a journal the picture definitely wasn’t great:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img22.png\" width=\"357\" height=\"391\" /></a></p>\n<p>And the NKS book provided another challenge as well. While the core of a picture might just be an array of cells like in a cellular automaton, a full algorithmic diagram could contain all sorts of other elements.</p>\n<p>In the end, the NKS book was a beneficiary of an important design decision that we made back in 1987, early in the development of Mathematica. At the time, most graphics were thought about in terms of bitmaps. On whatever device one was using, there was an array of pixels of a certain resolution. And the focus was on rendering the graphics at that resolution. Not everything worked that way, though. And “drawing” (as opposed to “painting”) programs typically created graphics in “vector” form, in which at first primitives like lines and polygons were specified without reference to resolution, and were then converted to bitmaps only when they were displayed.</p>\n<p>The shapes of characters in fonts were something that was often specified—at least at an underlying level—in vector form. There’d been various approaches to doing this, but by 1987 <a href='https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>PostScript</a> was an emerging standard—at least for printing—buoyed by its use in the Apple LaserWriter. The main focus of PostScript was on fonts and text, but the PostScript language also included standard graphics primitives like lines and polygons. </p>\n<p>Back when <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>I had built SMP in 1979–1981</a> we’d basically had to build a separate driver for every different display or printing device we wanted to output graphics on. But in 1987 there was an alternative: just use PostScript for everything. Printer manufacturers were working hard to support PostScript on their printers, but PostScript mostly hadn’t come to screens yet. There was an important exception though: the NeXT computer was set up to have PostScript as its native screen-rendering system. And partly through that, we decided to use PostScript as our underlying way to represent all graphics in Mathematica.</p>\n<p>At a high level, graphics were described with the same <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SymbolicGraphicsLanguage.html'>symbolic primitives as we use in the Wolfram Language today</a>: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Line.html'>Line</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Polygon.html'>Polygon</a></tt>, etc. But these were converted internally to PostScript—and even stored in notebooks that way. On the NeXT this was pretty much the end of the story, but on other systems we had to write our own interpreters for at least the subset of PostScript we were using. </p>\n<p>Why was this important to the NKS book? Well, it meant that all graphics could be specified in a fundamentally resolution-independent way. In developing the graphics I could look at them in a notebook on a screen, or I could print them on a standard laser printer. But for the final book the exact same graphics could be printed at much higher resolution—and look much crisper.</p>\n<p>At the time, the standard resolution of a computer screen was 72 dpi (dots per inch) and the resolution of a typical laser printer was 300 dpi. But the typical basic resolution of a book-printing pipeline was more like 2400 dpi. I’ll talk later about the adventure of actually printing the NKS book. But the key point was that because Mathematica’s graphics were fundamentally based on PostScript, they weren’t tied to any particular resolution, so they could in principle make use of whatever resolution was available.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, there were plenty of complicated issues. One had to do with indicating the cells in something like a cellular automaton. Here’s a picture of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>first few steps of rule 30</a>, shown as a kind of “macro bitmap”, with pure black and white cells:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 3px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img1.png\" alt='ArrayPlot' title='ArrayPlot' width='253' height='134' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img1A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1A_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1A_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But often I wanted to indicate the extent of each cell:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img2.png\" alt='ArrayPlot' title='ArrayPlot' width='284' height='140' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img2A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2A_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2A_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And in late 1991 and early 1992 we worried a lot about how to draw the “mesh” between cells. A first thought was just to use a thin black line. But that obviously wouldn’t work, because it wouldn’t separate black cells. And we soon settled on a <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GrayLevel.html'>GrayLevel</a></tt><tt>[.15]</tt> line, which was visible against both black and white. </p>\n<p>But how is such a line printed? If we’re just using black ink, there’s ultimately either black or white at a particular place on the page. But there’s a standard way to achieve the appearance of gray, by changing the local density of black and white. And the typical method used to implement this is (<a href=\"https://writings.internal.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#how-to-publish-a-book\">as we’ll discuss later</a>) <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-7--halftoning/'>halftoning</a>, in which one renders the “gray” by using black dots of different sizes.</p>\n<p>But by the time one&#8217;s using very thin gray lines, things are getting very tricky. For example, it matters how much the ink on either side of the line spreads—because if it&#8217;s too much it can effectively fill in where the line was supposed to be. We wanted to define standards that we could use throughout the NKS book. And we couldn&#8217;t tell what would happen in the final printed book except by actually trying it, on a real printing press. So already in early 1992 we started doing print tests, trying out different thicknesses of lines and so on. And that allowed us to start setting graphics standards that we could implement in the Wolfram Language code used to make the algorithmic diagrams, that would then flow through to all renderings of those diagrams.</p>\n<p>Back in 1991 we debated quite a bit whether the NKS book should use color. We knew it would be significantly more expensive to print the book in color. But would color allow seriously better communication of information? Two-color cellular automata like rule 30 can be rendered in pure black and white. But over the years I’d certainly made many striking color pictures of cellular automata with more colors. </p>\n<p>Somehow, though, those pictures hadn’t <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/?iframe=true'>seemed quite as crisp</a> as the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/cellular-automata-from-christmas-1983/?iframe=true'>black and white ones</a>. And there was another issue too, having to do with a problem I’d noticed in the mid-1980s in human visual perception of arrays of colored cells. Somewhat nerdily, I ended up including a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--using-color/'>note about this in the final NKS book</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25.png\" width=\"448\" height=\"299\" /></a></p>\n<p>But the final conclusion was that, yes, the NKS book would be pure black and white. Nowadays—particularly with screen rendering being in many ways more important than print—it’s much easier to do things in color. And, for example, in our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> it’s been very convenient to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/additional-material/appendix-graph-types/' target=_blank rel=noopener>distinguish types of graphs, or nodes in graphs, by color</a>. But for the NKS book I think it was absolutely the right decision to use black and white. Color might have added some nice accents to certain kinds of diagrams. But the clarity—and visual force—of the images in the book was much better served by the perceptual crispness of pure black and white. </p>\n<h2 id='how-to-lay-out-the-book'>How to Lay Out the Book</h2>\n<p>The way most books with complex formats get produced is that first the author creates “disembodied” pieces of content, then a designer or production artist comes in and arranges them on pages. But for the NKS book I wanted something where the process of creation and layout was much more integrated, and where—just as I was directly writing Wolfram Language code to produce images—I could also directly lay out final book pages.</p>\n<p>By 1990 “desktop publishing” was commonplace, and there were plenty of systems that basically allowed one to put anything anywhere on a page. But to make a whole book we knew we needed a more consistent and templated approach—that could also interact programmatically with the Wolfram Language. There were a few well-developed “full-scale book production systems” that existed, but they were complex “industrially oriented” pieces of software, that didn’t seem realistic for me to use interactively while writing the book.</p>\n<p>In mid-1990, though, we saw a demo of something new, running on the NeXT computer: a system called FrameMaker, which featured book-production capabilities, as well as a somewhat streamlined interchange format. Oh, and especially on the NeXT, it handled PostScript graphics well, inserting them “by reference” into documents. By late 1990 we were building book layout templates in FrameMaker, and we soon settled on using that for the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--book-production-system/'>basic production of the book</a>. (Later, to achieve all the effects we wanted, we ended up having to process everything through Wolfram Language, but that’s another story.</p>\n<p>We iterated for a while on the book design, but by the end of 1991 we’d nailed it down, and I started authoring the book. I made images using Mathematica, importing them in “<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/EPS.html'>Encapsulated PostScript</a>” into FrameMaker. And words I typed directly into FrameMaker—in the environment reconstructed here using a virtual machine that we saved from the time of authoring the book:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25a.png\" width=\"570\" height=\"494\" /></a></p>\n<p>I composed every page—not only its content, but also its visual appearance. If I had a cellular automaton to render, and it was going to occupy a certain region on a page, I would pick the number of cells and steps to be appropriate for that region. I was constantly adjusting pictures to make them look good on a given page, or on pairs of facing pages, or along with other nearby pictures, and so on. </p>\n<p>One of the tricky issues was how to refer to pictures from within the text. In technical books, it&#8217;s common to number &#8220;figures&#8221;, so that the text might say &#8220;See Figure 16”. But I wanted to avoid that piece of &#8220;scaffolding&#8221;, and instead always just be able to say things like &#8220;the picture below&#8221;, or &#8220;the picture on the facing page“. It was often quite a puzzle to see how to do this. If a picture was too big, or the text was too small, the picture would get too far ahead, and so on. And I was constantly adjusting things to make everything work.</p>\n<p>I also decided that for elegance I wanted to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--hyphenation/'>avoid ever having to hyphenate words</a> in the text. And quite often I found myself either rewording things, or slightly changing letter spacing, to make things fit, and to avoid things like &#8220;orphaned&#8221; words at the beginnings of lines.</p>\n<p>It was a strange and painstaking process getting each page to look right, and adjusting content and layout together. Sometimes things got a little pathological. I always wanted to fill out pages, and not to leave space at the bottom (oh, and facing pages had to be exactly the same height). And I also tried to start new sections on a new page. But there I was, writing <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond/'>Chapter 5</a>, and trying to end the section on &#8220;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-4--substitution-systems-and-fractals'>Substitution Systems and Fractals</a>”—and I had an empty bottom third of a page. What was I to do? I decided to invent a whole new kind of system, that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p192--substitution-systems-and-fractals/'>appears on page 192</a>, just to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p191--substitution-systems-and-fractals/'>fill out the layout for page 191</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/swimg051322img26.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/swimg051322img26.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>\n<p>Looking through my archives, I find traces of other examples.

I’d successfully captured pretty much everything I’d known when I started on the book back in 1991, and I’d had three years of good discoveries. But what was still to come was seven years of intense research and writing that would take me much further than I had ever imagined back in 1991—and would end up roughly doubling the length of the book. </p>\n<h2 id='photographs-for-the-book'>Photographs for the Book</h2>\n<p>In 1991 I knew the book I was going to write would have lots of cellular automaton pictures. And I imagined that the main other type of pictures it would contain would be photographs of actual, natural systems. But where was I going to get those photographs from? There was no web with image search back then. We looked at stock photo catalogs, but somehow the kinds of images they had (often oriented towards advertising) were pretty far from what we wanted. </p>\n<p>Over the years, I had collected—albeit a bit haphazardly—quite a few relevant images. But we needed many more. I wanted pictures illustrating both complexity, and simplicity. But the good news was that, as I explained early in the book, both are ubiquitous. So it should be easy to find examples of them—that one could go out and take nice, consistent photographs of. </p>\n<p>And starting in late 1991, that’s just what we did. My archives contain all sorts of negatives and contact prints (yes, this was before digital photography, and, yes, that’s a bolt—intended as an example of simplicity in an artifact):</p>\n<table

(And it was very convenient that this was a plant-related question, because I’m horribly squeamish when it comes to dissecting animals, even for food.)</p>\n<p>Some of what I wanted to photograph was out in the world. But some was also collectible. Ever since I was a kid I had been gradually acquiring interesting shells, fossils, rocks and so on, sometimes “out in the field”, but more often at shops. Working on the NKS book I dramatically accelerated that process. Shells were a particular focus, and I soon got to the point where I had specimens of most of the general kinds with “interesting forms”.

Like when we got an employee of ours who happened to be vacationing in Italy to go to part of an obscure church in rural Italy—and get a photograph of a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--ornamental-art/'>mosaic there from 1226 AD</a> (and, yes, those are our photographer&#8217;s feet):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img34.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img34.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='483' height='321' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img34_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='34_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='34_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id='what-should-the-book-be-called?'>What Should the Book Be Called?</h2>\n<p>When I started working on the book in 1991 I saw it as an extension of what I’d done in the 1980s to establish a “science of complexity”. So at first I simply called the book <em>The Science of Complexity</em>, adding the explanatory subtitle <em>A Unified Approach to Complex Behavior in Natural and Artificial Systems</em>. But after a while I began to feel that this sounded a bit stodgy—and like a textbook—so to spruce it up a bit I changed it to <em>A New Science of Complexity</em>, with subtitle <em>Rethinking the Mechanisms of Nature:</em></p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='224' height='298' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Pretty soon, though, I dropped the “New” as superfluous, and the title became <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. I always knew computation was a key part of the story, but as I began to understand more about just what was out there in the computational universe, I started thinking I should capture “computation” in the name of the book, leading to a new idea: <em>Computation and the Complexity of Nature</em>. And for this title I even had a first cover draft made—complete with an eye, added on the theory that human visual perception would draw people to the eye, and thus make them notice the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='347' height='429' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But back in 1992 (and I think it would be different today) people really didn’t understand the term “computation”, and it just made the book sound very technical to them. So back I went to <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. I wasn’t very happy with it, though, and I kept on thinking about alternatives. In August 1992 I prepared a little survey:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='520' height='538' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The results of this survey were—like those of many surveys—inconclusive, and didn’t change my mind about the title. Still, in October 1992 I dashed off an email considering <em>The Inevitable Complexity of Nature and Computation</em>. But 15 minutes later, as I put it, I&#8217;d &#8220;lost interest&#8221; in that, and it was back to <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. </p>\n<p>By 1993, believing that the completion of the book was somehow imminent, we’d started trying to mock up the complete look of the book, including things like the back cover, and cover flaps:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='576' height='448' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The flap copy began: “This book is about a new kind of science that&#8230;”. In the first chapter there was then a section called “The Need for a New Kind of Science”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='578' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As 1993 turned into 1994 I was still working with great intensity on the book, leaving almost no time to be out and about, talking about what I was doing. Occasionally, though, I would run into people and they would ask me what I was working on, and I would say it was a book, titled <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. And when I said that—at least among non-technical people—the reaction was essentially always the same “Oh, that sounds very complicated”. And that would be the end of the conversation.</p>\n<p>By September 1994 this had happened just too many times, and I realized I needed a new title. So I thought to myself &#8220;How would I describe the book?&#8221;. And there it was, right in the flap copy: &#8220;a new kind of science”. I made a quick note on the back of my then business card:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='483' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And soon that was the title: <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. I started trying it out. The reaction was again almost always the same. But now it was “So, what’s new about it?” And that would start a conversation.</p>\n<p>I liked the title a lot. It definitely said what by then I thought the book was about. But there was one thing I didn’t like. It seemed a bit like a “meta title”. OK, so you have a new kind of science. But what is that new kind of science called? What is its name? And why isn’t the book called that?</p>\n<p>I spent countless hours thinking about this. I thought about word roots. I considered comp- (for “computation”), prog- (for “program”), auto- (for “automata”, etc.). I went through Latin and Greek dictionaries, and considered roots like arch- and log- (both way too confusing). I wrote programs to generate “synthetic words” that might evoke the right meaning. I considered names like “algonomics”, “gramistry”, “regulistics” (but not “ruliology”!), and “programistics”—for which I tried to see how its usage might work:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='459' height='625' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But nothing quite clicked. And in a sense my working title already told me why: I was talking about “a new kind of science”, which involved a new way of thinking, for which there were really no words, because it hadn’t been done before.</p>\n<p>I’d had a certain amount of experience inventing words, for concepts in both science and technology. Sometimes it had gone well, sometimes not so well. And I knew the same was true in general in history. For every “physics” or “economics” or even “cybernetics” there were countless names that had never made it. </p>\n<p>And eventually I decided that even if I could come up with a name, it wasn’t worth the risk. Maybe a name would eventually emerge, and it would be perfectly OK if the “launch book” was called <em>A New Kind of Science</em> (as yet unnamed). Certainly much better than if it gave the new kind of science a definite name, but the name that stuck was different.</p>\n<p>During the writing of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I didn’t really need to “refer in the third person” to what the book was about. But pretty much as soon as the book was published, there needed to be a name for the intellectual endeavor that the book was about. During the development of the book, some of the people working on its project management had started calling the book by the initials of its title: ANKOS. And that was the seed for the name of its content, which almost immediately became “NKS”.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve returned quite a few times to the question of naming. And very recently I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>started using the term &#8220;ruliology&#8221;</a> for one of the key pursuits of NKS: exploring the details of what systems based on simple computational rules do. I like the name, and I think it captures well the ethos of the specific scientific activity around studying the consequences of simple rules. But it’s not the whole story of “NKS”. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is, as its name suggests, about a new kind of science—and a new way of thinking about the kind of thing we imagine science can be about. </p>\n<p>When the book was first published, some people definitely seemed to feel that the strength and simplicity of the title “<em>A New Kind of Science</em>” must claim too much. But twenty years later, I think it’s clear that the title said it right. And it’s charming now when people talk about what’s in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and how it’s different from other things, and want to find a way to say what it is—and end up <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiOnolbVYs8&#038;t=4727s' target=_blank rel=noopener>finding themselves saying it&#8217;s &#8220;a new kind of science&#8221;</a>. And, yes, that’s why I called the book that!</p>\n<h2 id='the-cover-of-the-book'>The Cover of the Book</h2>\n<p>We started thinking about the cover of the book very early in the project—with the “eye” design being the first candidate. But considering this a bit too surreal, the next candidate designs were more staid.

That would have been interesting. But another 400 pages?</p>\n<h2 id='ten-years-of-writing'>Ten Years of Writing</h2>\n<p>By the end of 1991 the basic concept of what would become <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was fairly clear. At the time, I still thought—as I had in the 1980s—that the best “hook” was the objective of “explaining complexity”. But I perfectly well understood that from an intellectual and methodological point of view the most important part of the story was that I was starting to truly take seriously the notion of computation—and starting to think broadly in a fundamentally computational way. </p>\n<p>But what could be figured out like this? What about systems based on constraints? What about systems that adapt or learn? What about biological evolution? What about fundamental physics? What about the foundations of mathematics? At the outset, I really didn’t know whether my approach would have anything to say about these things. But I thought I should at least try to check each of them out. And what happened was that every time I turned over a (metaphorical) rock it seemed like I discovered a whole new world underneath.</p>\n<p>It was intellectually exciting—and almost addictive. I would get into some new area and think “OK, let me see what I can figure out here, then move on”. But then I would get deeper and deeper into it, and weeks would turn into months, and months would turn into years. At the beginning I would sometimes tell people what I was up to. And they would say “That sounds interesting. But what about X, Y, Z?” And I would think “I might as well try and answer those questions too”. But I soon realized that I shouldn’t be letting myself get distracted: I already had more than enough very central questions to answer.</p>\n<p>And so I decided to pretty much “go hermit” until the book was done. An email I sent on October 1, 1992, summarizes how I was thinking at the time: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='444' height='139' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But that email was right before I discovered yet more kinds of computational systems to explore, and before I’d understood applications to biology, and physics, and mathematics, and so on. </p>\n<p>In the early years of the project I’d had various “I could do that as well” ideas. In 1991 I thought about dashing off an <em>Introduction to Computing</em> book (maybe I should do that now!). In 1992 I had a plan for creating an email directory for the world (a very proto LinkedIn). In 1993 I thought about TIX: “The Information Exchange” (a proto web for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/the-new-world-of-notebook-publishing/'>computable documents</a>). </p>\n<p>But thinking even a little about these things basically just showed me how much what I really wanted to do was move forward on the science and the book. I was still energetically remote-CEOing my company. But every day, by mid-evening, I would get down to science, and work on it through much of the night. And pretty much that’s how I spent the better part of a decade. </p>\n<p>My <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/'>personal analytics data</a> of outgoing emails show that during the time I was working on the book I became increasingly nocturnal (I shifted and “stabilized” after the book was finished):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img2temp-v4A.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img2temp-v4A.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='568' height='349' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I had started the NKS book right after the big push to release <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1991/06/02/1991_mathematica2-2/?iframe=true'>Mathematica 2.0</a>. And thinking the book would take a year or maybe 18 months I figured it would be long finished before there was a new version of Mathematica, and another big push was needed. But it was not to be. And while I held off as long as I could, by 1996 there was no choice: I had to jump into finishing Mathematica 3.0.</p>\n<p>From the beginning until now I’ve always been the ultimate architect of what’s now the Wolfram Language. And back in the 1990s my way of defining the specification for the language was to write its documentation, as a book. So getting <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1996/07/07/1993_itshere-2/?iframe=true'> Mathematica 3.0</a> out required me writing a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>new edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</a></em>. And since we were <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v3/'>adding a lot in Version 3</a>, the book was long—eventually clocking in at 1403 pages. And it took me a good part of 1996 to write it.</p>\n<p>But in September 1996, Mathematica 3.0 was released, and I was able to go back to my intense focus on science and the NKS book. In many ways it was exhilarating. With <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> as a tool, I was powering through so much research. But it was difficult stuff. And getting everything right—and as clear as possible—was painstaking, if ultimately deeply satisfying, work. On a good day I might manage to write one page of the book. Other times I might spend many days working out what would end up as just a single paragraph in the notes at the back of the book.</p>\n<p>I kept on thinking “OK, in just a few months it’ll be finished”. But I just kept on discovering more and more. And finding out again and again that sections in the table of contents that I thought would just be “quick notes” actually led to major research projects with all sorts of important and unexpected results. </p>\n<p>A 1995 picture captured my typical working setup:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A year or so later, I had the desk I’m still sitting at today (though not in the same location), and a (rarely used) webcam had appeared:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='333' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A few years after that, the computer monitor was thinner, two young helpers had arrived, and I was looking distinctly unkempt and hermit-like:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='572' height='419' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In 2000 a <a href='https://aguilerahellweg.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>photographer for Forbes</a> captured my “caged scientist” look</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='383' height='469' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>along with a rather nice artistically lit “still life” of my working environment (complete with a “from-the-future” thicker-than-real-life mockup of the NKS book):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='383' height='441' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But gradually, inexorably, the book got closer and closer to being finished. The floor of my office had been covered with piles of paper, each marked with whatever issue or unfinished section they related to. But by 2001 the piles were disappearing—and by the fall of that year they were all but gone: a visible sign that the book was nearing completion. </p>\n<h2 id='tracking-everything-down:-a-decade-of-scholarship'>Tracking Everything Down: A Decade of Scholarship</h2>\n<p><em>A New Kind of Science</em> is—as its title suggests—a book about new things. But an important part of explaining new things is to provide context for them. And for me a key part of the context for things is always the story of what led to them. And that was something I wanted to capture in the NKS book.</p>\n<p>Typically there were two parts: a personal narrative of how I was led to something—and a historical narrative of what in the past might connect to it. The academic writing style that I’d adopted in the 1980s really didn’t capture either of these. So for the NKS book I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--writing-style/'>needed a new style</a>. And there were again two parts to this. First, I needed to “put myself into the text”, describing in the first person how I’d reached conclusions, and what their importance to me was. And second, I needed to “tell the story” of whatever historical developments were relevant.</p>\n<p>Early on, I made the decision not to mix these kinds of narratives. I would talk about my own relation to the material. And I would talk about other people and their <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--historical-notes/'>historical relation to the material</a>. But I didn’t talk about my interactions with other people. And, yes, there are lots of wonderful stories to tell—which perhaps one day I’ll have a chance to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/historical-perspectives'>systematically write down</a>. But for the NKS book I decided that these stories—while potentially fun to read—just weren’t relevant to the absorption and contextualization of what I had to say. So, with a bit of regret, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--autobiographical-elements/'>I left them out</a>.</p>\n<p>In typical academic papers one references other work by inserting pure, uncommented citations to it. And deep within some well-developed field, this is potentially an adequate thing to do. Because in such a field, the structure is in a sense already laid out, so a pure citation is enough to explain the connection. But for the NKS book it was quite different. Because most of the time the historical antecedents were necessarily done in quite different conceptual frameworks—and typically the only reasonable way to see the connection to them was to tell the story of what was done and why, recontextualized in an “NKS way”.</p>\n<p>And what this meant was that in writing the NKS book, I ended up doing a huge amount of “scholarship”, tracking down history, and trying to piece together the stories of what happened and why. Sometimes I personally knew—or had known—the people involved. Sometimes I was dealing with things that had happened centuries ago. Often there were mysteries involved. How did this person come to be thinking about this? Why didn’t they figure this-or-that out? What really was their conceptual framework?</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a person who tries to “do my homework” in any field I’m studying. I want to know both what’s known, and what’s not known. I want to get a sense of the patterns of thinking in the field, and “value systems” of the field. Many times in working on the NKS book I got the sense that this-or-that field should be relevant. But what was important for the NKS book was often something that was a footnote—or was even implicitly ignored—by the field. And it also didn’t help that the names for things in particular fields were often informed by their specific uses there, and didn’t connect with what was natural for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>I started the NKS book shortly after the web was invented, and well before there was substantial content on it. So at least at first a lot of my research had to be done the same way I’d done it in the 1980s: from printed books and papers, and by using online and printed abstracting systems.

Perhaps it might have been nice when the NKS book was published to be able to say in a kind of traditional academic style “here are the ‘citations’” (and, finally, 20 years later we’re about to be able to actually do that). But at the time it wasn’t the simple citations I wanted, or thought would be useful; it was the narrative I could piece together from them. </p>\n<p>And sometimes the papers weren’t enough, and I had to make requests from document archives, or actually interview people. It was hard work, with a steady stream of surprises. For example, in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/u/?search=Ulam'>Stan Ulam</a>’s archives we found a (somewhat scurrilous) behind-the-scenes interaction about me. And after many hours of discussion <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/con-cp/?search=Conway'>John Conway</a> admitted to me that his usual story about the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--history-of-cellular-automata/'>origin of the Game of Life wasn&#8217;t correct</a>—though I at least found the true story much more interesting (even if some mystery still remains). There were times when the things I wanted to know were still entangled in government or other secrecy. And there were times when people had just outright forgotten, often because the things I now cared about just hadn’t seemed important before—and now could only be recovered by painstakingly “triangulating” from other recollections and documents.</p>\n<p>There were so many corners to the scholarship involved in creating the NKS book. One memorable example was what we called the “People Dates” project. I wanted the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/names/'>index to include</a> not only the name of every person I mentioned in the book, but also their dates, and the primary country or countries in which they worked, as in “Wolfram, Stephen (England/USA, 1959&#8211; ).”</p>\n<p>For some people that information was straightforward enough to find. But for other people there were challenges. There were 484 people altogether in the index, with a roughly exponentially increasing number born after about 1800: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='465' height='237' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For ones who were alive we just sent them email, usually getting helpful (if sometimes witty) responses. In other cases we had to search government records, ask institutions, or find relatives or other personal contacts. There were lots of weird issues about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--people-in-the-index/'>transliterations, historical country designations, and definitions of &#8220;worked in&#8221;</a>. But in the end we basically got everything (though for example <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/s-sg/?search=Sch%C3%B6nfinkel'>Moses Schönfinkel</a>’s date of death remained a mystery, as it does even now, after all <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/a-little-closer-to-finding-what-became-of-moses-schonfinkel-inventor-of-combinators/'>my recent research</a>). </p>\n<p>Most of the historical research I did for the NKS book wound up in notes at the back of the book. But of all the 1350 notes spread over 348 small-print pages, only <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/'>102 were in the end historical</a>. The other notes covered a remarkable range of subject matter. They provided background information, technical details and additional results. And in many ways the notes represent the highest density of information in the NKS book—and I, for example, constantly find myself referring to them, and to their pithy (and, I think, rather clear) summaries of all sorts of things.</p>\n<p>When I was working on the book there were often things I thought I’d better figure out, just in case they were relevant to the core narrative of the book. Sometimes they’d be difficult things, and they’d take me—and my computers—days or even weeks. But quite often what came out just didn’t fit into the core narrative of the book, or its main text. And so the results were relegated to notes. Maybe there’ll just be one sentence in the notes making some statement. But behind that statement was a lot of work. </p>\n<p>Many times I would have liked to have had “notes to the notes”. But I restrained myself from adding yet more to the project. Even though today I’ve sometimes found myself writing <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/'>even hundreds of pages</a> to expand on what in the NKS book is just a note, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>even a part of a note</a>.</p>\n<p>The 1990s spanned the time from the very beginning of the web to the point where the web had a few million pages of content. And by the later years of the project I was making use of the web whenever I could. But often the background facts I needed for the notes were so obscure that there was nothing coherent about them on the web—and in fact even today it’s common for the notes to the NKS book to be the best summaries to be found anywhere. </p>\n<p>I figured, though, that the existence of the web could at least “get me off the hook” on some work I might otherwise have had to do. For example, I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--citations-and-references/'>didn&#8217;t think there was any point in giving explicit citations to documents</a>. I made sure to include relevant names of people and topics. Then it seemed as if it’d be much better just to search for those on the web, and find all relevant documents, than for me to do all sorts of additional scholarship trying to pick out particular citations that then someone might have to go to a library to look up. </p>\n<h2 id='finishing-the-book'>Finishing the Book</h2>\n<p>I’m not sure when I could say that the finishing of the NKS book finally seemed in sight. We’d been making bound book mockups since early 1994. Looking through them now it’s interesting to see how different parts gradually came together. In July 1995, for example, there was already a section in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>Chapter 9</a> on &ldquo;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-6--the-nature-of-space'>The Nature of Space</a>&rdquo;, but it was followed by a section on the “Nature of Time” that was just a few rough notes. There’s a hiatus in mockups in 1996 (when I was working on Mathematica 3.0) but when the mockups pick up again in January 1997—now bound in three volumes—there’s a section on “The Nature of Time” containing an early (and probably not very good) idea based on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-11--uniqueness-and-branching-in-time'>multiway systems</a> that I’d long since forgotten (later “The Nature of Time” section would be broken into different sections): </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='416' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Already in 1997 there’s a very rough skeleton of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Chapter 12</a>—with a fairly accurate collection of section headings, but just 18 pages of rather rough notes as content. Meanwhile, there’s a post-Chapter-12 “Epilog” that sprouts up, to be dropped only late in the project (see below). Chapter 12 begins to “bulk up” in late 1999, and in 2000 really “takes off”, for example adding the long section on &ldquo;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-9--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations'>Implications for the Foundations of Mathematics</a>&rdquo;. At that point our rate of making book mockups began to pick up. We’d been indicating different mockups with dates and colored labeling (“the banana version”, etc.) But, finally, dated February 14, 2001, there’s a version labeled (in imitation of software release nomenclature) “Alpha 1”.</p>\n<p>And by then I was starting to make serious use of the machinery for doing large projects that we’d developed for so many years at Wolfram Research. The “NKS Project” started having project managers, build systems and internal websites (yes, with garish web colors of the time):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='574' height='421' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We’d had the source for the book in a source control system for several years, but as far as I was concerned the ultimate source for the book was my filesystem, and a specific set of directories that, yes, are still there in my filesystem all these years later: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='353' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Everything was laid out by chapter and section. <span class=\"input\">Text</span> contained the FrameMaker files. <span class=\"input\">Notebooks</span> contained the source notebooks for all the diagrams (with long-to-compute results pre-stored in <tt>Results</tt>):</p>\n<p></a></p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='418' height='402' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The workflow was that every diagram was created in Wolfram Language, then saved as an EPS file. (<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/EPS.html\">EPS or &#8220;Encapsulated PostScript&#8221;</a> was a forerunner of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/PDF.html\">PDF</a>.) And gradually, over the course of years, more and more EPS files were generated, here reconstructed in the order of their generation, starting around 1994:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-eps-array-@2x.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-eps-array-@2x.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='645' height='682' /></a></p>\n<p>In creating all these EPS files, there was lots of detailed tweaking done, for example in the exact (programmatically specified) sizes for the images given in the files.  We&#8217;d built up a whole diagram-generating system, with all sorts of detailed standards for sizings and spacings and so on. And several times—particularly as a result of discovering quirks in the printing process—we decided we had to change the standards we were using. This could have been a project-derailing disaster. But because we had everything programmatically set up in notebooks it was actually quite straightforward to just go through and automatically regenerate the thousand or so images in the book.</p>\n<p>Each EPS file that was generated was put in a <tt>Graphics</tt> directory, then imported (“by reference”) by FrameMaker into the appropriate page of the book. And the result was something that looked almost like the final NKS book. But there were two “little” wrinkles, that ended up leading to quite a bit of technical complexity.</p>\n<p>The first had to with the fragments of Wolfram Language code in the notes. At the time it was typical to show code in a simple monospaced font like Courier. But I thought this looked ugly—and threw away much of the effort I’d put into making the code as elegant and readable as possible. So I decided we needed a different code font, and in particular a proportionally spaced sans serif one. But there was a technical problem with this. Many of the characters we needed for the code were available in any reasonable font. But some characters were special to the Wolfram Language—or at least were characters that for example we’d been responsible for being included in the <a href='https://home.unicode.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Unicode standard</a>, and weren’t yet widely supported in fonts. </p>\n<p>And the result was that in addition to all the other complexities of producing the book we had to design our own font, just for the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='394' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But that wasn’t all. In Mathematica 3.0 we had invented an elaborate typesetting system which carefully formatted Wolfram Language code, breaking it into multiple lines if necessary. But how were we to weave that nicely formatted code into the layouts of pages in FrameMaker? In the end we <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--book-production-system/'>had to use Wolfram Language to do this</a>. The way this worked is that first we exported the whole book from FrameMaker in “Maker Interchange Format” (MIF). Then we parsed the resulting MIF file in Wolfram Language, in effect turning the whole book into a big symbolic expression. At that point we could use whatever Wolfram Language functionality we wanted, doing various pattern-matching-based transformations and typesetting each of the pieces of code. (We also handled various aspects of the index at this stage.) Then we took the symbolic expression, converted it to MIF, and imported it back into FrameMaker.</p>\n<p>In the end the production of the book was handled by an automated build script—just like the ones we used to build Mathematica (the full build log is 11 pages long):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='' width='' height='228' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But, OK, so by early 2001 we were well on the way to setting all these technical systems up. But there was more to do in “producing the book”—as indicated for example by the various column headings in the project management internal website. “Graphics regenerated” was about regenerating all the EPS files with the final standards for the book. “Microtweaking” was about making sure the placement of all the graphics was just right. Then there were various kinds of what in our company we call “document quality assurance”, or DQA—checking every detail of the document, from grammar and spelling to overall consistency and formatting. (And, yes, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--writing-style/'>developing a style guide that worked with my sometimes-nonstandard</a>—but I believe highly sensible!—writing conventions.)</p>\n<p>In addition to checking the form of the book, there was also the question of checking the content. Much of that—including extensive fact checking, etc.—had gone on throughout the development of the book. But near the end one more piece of checking had to do with the code that was included in the book itself. Our company has had a long history of sophisticated software quality assurance (“SQA”), and I applied that to the book—for example having extensive tests written for all the code in the book.</p>\n<p>Much like for software, once we reached the first “Alpha version” of the book we also started sending it out to external “alpha testers”—and got a modest but helpful collection of responses. We had several pages of instructions for our “testers” (that we called “readers” since, after all, this was a book):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='527' height='514' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After the “Alpha 1” version of the book in February 2001, there followed six more “Alpha” versions. In “Alpha 1” there were still XXXX’s scattered around the text, alignment and other issues in graphics—and some of the more “philosophical” sections in the book were just in note form, crossed out with big X’s in the printout. But in the course of 2001 all these issues got ironed out. And on January 15, 2002, I finished and dated the preface.</p>\n<p>Then on February 4, 2002, we produced the &#8220;Beta 1&#8221; version of the book—and began to make final preparations for its printing and publication.

In these times of ubiquitous full-text search one might think that a book index would just be a quaint relic of the past (and indeed some younger people don’t even seem to know that most books have indices!). But it definitely isn’t with the NKS book. And indeed when I want to find something in the book, the place I always turn first is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/0/'>index (now online)</a>. </p>\n<p>I started creating the index to the NKS book in the spring of 1999, and finished it right before the final version of the book was produced in February 2002. I had already had the experience of creating indices to five editions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>, and had seen the importance of those indices in people’s actual use of Mathematica. I had developed various <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--index/'>theories about how to make a good index</a>—which sometimes differed from conventional wisdom—but seemed to work rather well. </p>\n<p>A good index, I believe, should list whatever terms one might actually think of looking up, regardless of whether it’s those literal terms—or just synonyms for them—that appear in the text. If there’s a phrase (like “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>finite automata</a>”) explicitly list it in all the ways people might think of it (“<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>finite automata</a>”, “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>automata, finite</a>”), rather than having some “theory” (that the users of the index are very unlikely to know) about how to list the phrase. And perhaps most important, generously include subterms, “subdividing” until each individual entry references at most a few pages. Because when you’re looking for something, you want to be able to zero in on a particular page, not be confronted with lots of “potentially relevant” pages. And well-chosen subterms immediately give a kind of pointillistic map of the coverage of some area.</p>\n<p>I’ve always enjoyed creating indices. For me it’s an interesting exercise in quickly organizing knowledge and identifying what’s important, as well as engaging in rapid “what are different ways to say that?” association. (And, yes, a similar skill is needed in linguistic curation for the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/natural-language-understanding/'>natural language understanding system</a> of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>.) For the NKS book (and other indices) my basic strategy was to go through the book page by page, adding tags for index entries. But what about consistency? Did I just index “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fig+leaves'>Fig leaves</a>” in one place, and somewhere else index “Leaves, fig” instead? We built Wolfram Language code to identify such issues. But eventually I just generated the alphabetical index, and read through it. And then had Wolfram Language code that could realign tags to correct the source of whatever fixes I made—which most often related to subterms.</p>\n<p>At first I broke the index into an ordinary “Index” and an “Index of Names”. But what counted as a “name”? Only a person’s name? Or also a place name? Or also “rule 30”? Within a couple of months I had combined everything into an “Index of words, names, concepts and systems”—which soon became headed just “Index” (with a pointer to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--index/'>a note about what was in it</a>). </p>\n<p>The final index is remarkably eclectic—reflecting of course the content of the book. After “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Field+theory+(Physics)'>Field theory (physics)</a>” comes “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fields+(agricultural)'>Fields (agricultural)</a>”, followed by “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fifths+(musical+chords)'>Fifths (musical chords)</a>” and so on: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='555' height='614' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the end the index—even printed as it was in 4 columns—ran to 80 pages (or more than 6% of the book). It was obviously a very useful index, and it could even be entertaining to read, not only for its eclectic jumps from one term to the next, but also for the unexpected terms that appeared. What’s “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Flash+photography'>Flash photography</a>” or “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Flint+arrowheads'>Flint arrowheads</a>” doing there, or “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/flo-fz/?search=Frogs'>Frogs</a>” for that matter? What do these terms have to do with a new kind of science? </p>\n<p>But for all its value, I was a bit concerned that the index might be so long that it finally made the book “too long”. Even without the index the book ran to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1197--historical-perspectives/'>1197 pages</a>. But why tell people, I thought, that the whole book is really 1280 pages, including the index? If the pages of the index were numbered, then one could immediately see the number of that last page. But why number the pages of an index? Nobody needs to refer to those pages by numbers; if anything, just use the alphabetized terms. So I decided just quietly to omit the page numbers of the index, so we could report the length of the book as 1192 pages.</p>\n<h2 id='how-to-publish-a-book'>How to Publish a Book</h2>\n<p>OK, so <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was going to be a book. But how was it going to be published? At the time I started writing <em>A New Kind of Science</em> in 1991 the second edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> had just been released, and its publisher (Addison-Wesley) seemed to be doing a good job with it. So it was natural to start talking about my new book with the same publisher. I was quite aware that Addison-Wesley was primarily a publisher of textbook-like books, and in fact the particular division of Addison-Wesley that had published <em>The Mathematica Book</em> was more oriented towards monographs and special projects. But the success of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> generated what seemed like good corporate interest in trying to publish my new book.</p>\n<p>But how would the details work? There were immediate questions even about printing the book. I knew the book would rely heavily on graphics which would need to be printed well. But to print them how they needed to be printed was expensive. So how would that work financially? (And at that point I didn’t yet even know that the book would also be more than a thousand pages long.) </p>\n<p>The basic business model of publishing tends to be: invest up front in making a book, then (hopefully) make money by selling the book. And for most authors, the book can’t happen without that up-front investment. But that wasn’t my situation. I didn’t need an advance to support myself while writing the book. I didn’t need someone to pay for the production of the book. And if necessary I could even make the investment myself to print the books. But what I thought I needed from a publisher was access to distribution channels. I needed someone to actually sell books to bookstores. I needed there to be a sales team that had relationships with bookstore chains, and that would do things like actually visit bookstores and get books into them.</p>\n<p>And in fact quite a lot of the early discussion about the publishing of the book centered around how salespeople would present it. How would the book be positioned relative to the well-known “popular science” books of the time? (That positioning would be key to the size of initial purchases bookstores might make.) What special ways might the salespeople make the book memorable? Could we get enough textile cone shells that the salespeople could drop one off at every bookstore they visited? (The answer, it was determined, was yes: in the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-7--collecting-shells/'>Philippines such shells were quite plentiful</a>.)</p>\n<p>But how exactly would the numbers work? Bookstores took a huge cut (often above 50%). And if the book was expensive to print, that didn’t leave much of a margin. At least at the time, the publishing industry was very much based on formulas. If you spend $x to print a book, you need to spend $y on marketing, and you pay the author $y (yes, same y) as an advance on royalties. For the author, the advance serves as a kind of guarantee of the publisher’s effort—since unless the book sells, the publisher just loses that money.</p>\n<p>Well, I most definitely wanted a guarantee that the publisher would put effort in. But I didn’t need or want an advance; I just wanted the publisher to put as much as possible into distribution. Around and around it went, trying to see how that might work. Exasperated, I found an expert on book deals. They didn’t seem to be able to figure it out either. And I began to think: perhaps I should go to a different publisher, maybe one more familiar with widely distributed books.</p>\n<p>It’s typical for authors not to interact directly with such publishers, but instead to go through an agent. In principle that allows authors not to have to exercise business savvy, and publishers not to be exposed to the foibles of authors. But I just wanted to make what—at least by tech industry standards—was a very simple deal. One agent I’d known for a while insisted that the key was to maximize the advance: “If the book earns out its advance [i.e. brings in more royalties from actual sales than were paid out up front], I haven’t done my job.” But that wasn’t my way of doing business. I wanted both sides in any deal to do well. </p>\n<p>Then there was the question of which publisher would be the right one. “Sell to the highest bidder”, was the typical advice. But what I cared about was successful book distribution, not how much a publisher might (perhaps foolishly) spend to get the book. Particularly at the time, it was a very clubby but strangely dysfunctional industry, full of belief in a kind of magic touch, but also full of stories of confusion and failure. Still, I thought that access to distribution channels was important enough to be worth navigating this.</p>\n<p>And by 1993 quite a bit of time had been spent on discussions about publishing the book. A particular, prominent New York publisher had been identified, and the process of negotiating a contract with them was underway. From a tech industry point of view it all seemed quite Victorian. It started from a printed (as in, on a printing press) 70-page contract that seemed to date from 20 years earlier. Though after not very long, essentially every single clause had been crossed out, and replaced by something different. </p>\n<p>An effort to “show what value they could bring” led to the incident about cover designs mentioned above. And then there was the story about printing, and printing costs. The terms of our potential deal made it quite important to know just how much it would cost to print the book. So to get a sense of that we got quotes from some of our usual printing vendors (and, yes, in those days before the web, a software company like ours did lots of printing). The publisher insisted that our quotes were too high—and that they could print the book much more cheaply. My team was skeptical. But at the center of this discussion was an important technical issue about how the book would actually be printed.</p>\n<p>Most widely distributed (&#8220;trade&#8221;) books are printed on so-called web presses—which are giant industrial machines that take paper from a roll and move it through at perhaps 30 mph. (The term “web” here refers to the “web of paper” on its path through the machine, not the subsequently invented World Wide Web.) A web press is a good way to print a just-read-the-words kind of book. But it doesn’t give one much control for pictures; if everything’s running through at high speed one can’t, for example, carefully inject more ink to deal with a big area of black on a specific page.</p>\n<p>And so if one wanted to print a more “art-quality” book one had to use a different approach: a sheet-fed press in which each collection of pages is “manually” set up to be printed separately on a large sheet of paper. Sheet-fed presses give one much more control—but they’re more expensive to operate. The printing quotes we’d got were for sheet-fed presses, because that was the only way we could see printing the book at the quality level we wanted. (I was sufficiently curious about the whole process that I went to watch a print run for something we were printing. In interacting with our potential publisher, I was rather disappointed to discover that none of the editorial team appeared to have ever actually seen anything being printed.)</p>\n<p>But in any case the publisher was claiming that they knew better than us, and that they could get the quality we needed on a web press, at a much lower price. They offered to run a test to prove it. We were again skeptical: to do the setup for a web press is an expensive process, and it makes no sense to do it for anything other than a real print run of thousands of books. But the publisher insisted they could do it. And our only admonition was “Don’t show us a result claiming it was made on a web press when it wasn’t!”. </p>\n<p>A few weeks went by. Back came the test. “You can’t be serious”, we said. “That’s a sheet from a sheet-fed press; we can see the characteristic registration marks!” I never quite figured out if they thought they could pull the wool over our eyes, or if this was just pure cluelessness. But for me it was basically the last straw. They came back and said “Why don’t we just refactor the contract and give you a really big advance?” “Nope”, I said “you’re profoundly missing the point! We’re done.” And that’s how—in 1995—we came to make the decision to publish <em>A New Kind of Science</em> “ourselves”.</p>\n<p>But when I say “ourselves” there was quite a bit more to that story. Back at the beginning of 1995 we were thinking about the upcoming third edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>, and realizing that we needed to re-jigger its publishing arrangements. And while the machinations with publishers about the NKS book had been a huge waste of time, they had helped me understand more about the publishing industry—and made me decide it was time for us to create our own publishing “imprint”, <a href='https://www.wolfram-media.com/'>Wolfram Media</a>.</p>\n<p><a href='https://web.archive.org/web/19961222151452/https://wolfram-media.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>Its website from 1996</a> (I never liked that logo!) highlights our first title—the co-published third edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='484' height='588' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This was soon joined by other titles, like our <a href='https://www.wolfram-media.com/products/graphica1.html'>heavily illustrated<em> Graphica </em>books</a>. But it wasn’t until 1999 that I began to think more seriously about the final publishing of the NKS book. In the fall of 1999 we duly listed the book with the large bookstore chains and book distributors, as well as with the already-very-successful Amazon. And in late 2000 we started touting the book on our <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20001018202031/https://www.wolfram-media.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>now-more-attractive website</a> as “A major release coming soon&#8230;”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='564' height='456' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Particularly in those days, the typical view was that most of the sales of a book would happen in the first few weeks after it was published. But—as we’ll discuss later—printing a book (and especially one like the NKS book) takes many weeks. So that creates a tricky situation, in which a publisher has to make a high-stakes decision about how many books to print at the beginning. Print too few books and at least for a time, you won’t be able to fill orders, and you’ll lose out on the initial sales peak. Print too many books and you’ll be left with an inventory of unsold books—though the more books you print in a single print run, the more you’ll spread the initial setup cost over more books, and the lower the cost of each individual book will be.</p>\n<p>Bookstores were also an important part of the picture. Books were at the time still predominantly bought through people physically browsing at bookstores. So the more copies of a book a bookstore had, the more likely it was that someone would see it there, and buy it. And all this added up to a big focus of publishing being on the size of the initial orders that bookstores made.</p>\n<p>How was that determined? Mostly it was up to the buyers at bookstores and bookstore chains: they had to understand enough about a book to make an accurate prediction of how many they’d be able to sell. There was a complicated dance through which publishers signaled their expectations, saying for example “X copy initial print run”, “X-city promotional tour”, “$X promotional budget”. But in the end it was a very person-to-person sales process, often done by traveling-around-the-country salespeople who’d developed relationships with book buyers over the course of many years.</p>\n<p>How were we going to handle this? It certainly helped that by late 2000 there were starting to be <a href='https://www.forbes.com/asap/2000/1127/162.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>lengthy news articles</a> anticipating the book. And it also helped that one could see that the book was gaining momentum on Amazon. But would a sales manager we had who was used to selling software be able to sell books? At least in this case the answer was yes, and by the end of 2001 there were starting to be substantial orders from bookstores.</p>\n<p>By the time I finished writing the book at the beginning of 2002 we were in full “book-publishing” mode. There were still lots of issues to resolve. How would we handle distribution outside the US? (We’d actually had a UK co-publisher lined up but we eventually gave up on them.) How would we reach the full range of independent bookstores? And so on. Looking at my archives I find mail from April 2002 in which I was contacting Jeff Bezos about a practical issue with Amazon; Jeff responded that he “couldn’t wait to read [the book]”, noting that “For a serious book like yours, we often account for a substantial fraction of sales.” He was right—and in fact the NKS book would reach the #1 bestseller slot on Amazon.</p>\n<p>By the beginning of 2002 we’d had a design for the front cover of the NKS book for six years. But what about the back cover? It’s traditional to put quotes (“blurbs”) on the backs of books that people will browse in bookstores. So, in February 2002 we sent a few draft copies of the book to people we thought might give us interesting quotes. Probably the most charming response was Arthur C. Clarke’s report of the delivery of the book to his house in Sri Lanka:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='444' height='191' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A few days later, he emailed again “Well, I have &lt;looked&gt; at (almost) every page and am still in a state of shock.

He responded that he thought I really shouldn’t have quotes on the back of the book. “Isaac Newton didn’t have quotes; nor should you.” And, yes, Steve had a point. I was trying to write a book that would have long-term value; it didn’t really make sense to have moment-of-publication quotes printed on it.</p>\n<p>So—feeling bad for having solicited quotes in the first place—we dropped them from the back cover, instead just putting <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/backcoverimages/'>images from the book that we thought would intrigue people</a>:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='325' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Still, my team did use Arthur C.

But there’s a standard method for achieving the appearance of gray, which is to use halftoning, based essentially on an array of dots of different sizes.

That was a difficult question, and was only answered by lots of print testing. One of the main points was: even if you effectively specify dots of a certain size, what will be the actual sizes of dots formed when the ink is absorbed into the paper? And similarly: will the ink from black cells spread into the area of the gray line you’re trying to print between them? In printing it’s typical to talk about “dot gain”. If you think you’re setting up dots to give a certain gray level, what will be the actual gray level you’ll get when those dots are made of ink on paper?</p>\n<p>We were constantly testing things like this, with different printing technology, different paper and so on:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='538' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='14_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='14_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We used a “densitometer” (yes, this was before modern digital cameras) to measure the actual gray level, and deduce the dot gain function. And we tested things like how thin lines could be before they wouldn’t print.</p>\n<p>In halftoning, one effectively applies a global “screen” (as in, something with an array of holes in it, just like in pre-digital printing) to determine the positions of dots. We considered effectively setting up our own <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-7--halftoning/'>dot placement algorithm</a>, that would for example better align with cells in something like a cellular automaton. But tests didn’t show particularly good behavior, and we soon reverted to considering the “traditional approach”, though with various kinds of tweaking. </p>\n<p>Should the halftone dots be round, or elliptical? What should the angle of the array of dots be (it definitely needed to avoid horizontal and vertical directions)?

Given that one already has film, one can make the plate essentially photographically—more or less the same way microprocessor layouts and many other things are made. But by the beginning of the 2000s, there was a new technology: direct-to-plate printing, in which an (ultraviolet) laser directly etches the plate (a kind of much-higher-resolution “plate analog” of what a laser printer does). And in order to get the very crispest results, direct-to-plate printing was what we used for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>What’s the actual setup for printing? In the sheet-fed approach that we were using, one combines multiple pages (in our case 8) as a “signature” to be printed from a single plate onto a single piece of paper. Here’s a (yes, rather-unremarkable-looking) actual plate that was used for the first printing of the NKS book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img19.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='573' height='425' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And here’s an example of a signature printed from it, with pages that will subsequently be cut and folded:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img20.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='573' height='368' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img20_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='20_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='20_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Under a microscope, the plate looks pretty much like what will finally be printed onto the paper:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img21.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='475' height='256' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But now the next big issue is: what kind of paper should one use? If the paper is glossy, ink won’t spread on it, and it’s easier to get things crisp. But adding a glossy coating to paper makes the paper heavier and thicker, and we quickly determined that it wasn’t going to be practical to print the NKS book on glossy paper. Back in the 1980s it had become quite popular to print books on paper that looked good at first, but after a few years would turn yellow and disintegrate. And to avoid that, we knew we needed acid-free paper.</p>\n<p>Any particular kind of paper will come in different “weights”, or thicknesses. And the thicker the paper is, the more opaque it will be, and the less see-through the pages of the book will be—but also the thicker the book will be with a given number of pages. At the beginning we didn’t know how long the NKS book would be, and we were looking at comparatively thick papers; by the end we were trying to use paper that was as thin as possible.</p>\n<p>Back in 1993 we&#8217;d identified Finch Opaque as a possible type of paper. In 1995 our paper rep suggested as an alternative Finch VHF (“Very High Finish”)—which was very smooth, and was quite bright white. But normally this paper was used in very thick pages. Still, it was possible for the paper mill to produce thinner versions as well. We studied the possibilities, and eventually decided that a 50-lb version (i.e. with the paper weighing 50 lbs per 500 uncut sheets) would be the best compromise between bulk and opacity. So 50-lb Finch VHF paper is what the NKS book is printed on.</p>\n<p>Paper, of course, is made from trees. And as I’ll explain below, during the publishing of the NKS book, I became quite aware of the physical location of the trees from which the paper for the NKS book was made: they were in upstate New York (in the Adirondacks). At the time, though, I didn’t know more details about the trees. But a few years ago I learned that they were <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=eastern+hemlock'>eastern hemlock trees</a>. And it turns out that these coniferous trees are unusual in having long fibers—which is what allows the paper to be as smooth as it is. Talking about hemlock makes one think of Socrates. But no, hemlock the poison comes from the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=poison+hemlock'>&#8220;poison hemlock&#8221; plant</a> (<em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Conium+maculatum'>Conium maculatum</a></em>), which is unrelated to <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=tsuga'>hemlock trees</a> (which didn’t grow in Europe and seem to have gotten their hemlock name only fairly recently, and for rather tenuous reasons). So, no, the NKS book is not poisonous!</p>\n<p>Once signatures are printed, the next thing is that the signatures have to be folded and cut—in the end forming little booklet-like objects. And then comes the final step: binding these pieces together into the finished book. By the mid-1990s <em>The Mathematica Book</em> had given us quite a bit of experience with the binding of “big books”—and it wasn’t good. Many copies of multiple versions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> (yes, not printed by us) had basically self-destructed in the hands of customers. </p>\n<p>How were we going to be sure this wouldn’t happen for the NKS book? First, many books—including some versions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>—were basically “bound” by just gluing the signatures into the “case” of the book (with little fake threads added at the ends, for effect). But to robustly bind a big book one really has to actually sew the signatures to the case, and a standard way to do this is what’s called Smythe sewing. And that’s what we determined to use for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>Still, we wanted to test things. So we sent books to a book-testing lab, where the books were “tumbled” inside a steel container, 1200 times per hour, “impacting the tail, binding edge, head and face” of each book 4800 times per hour. After 1 hour, the lab reported “spine tight and intact”. After 2 hours “text block detached from cover”. But that’s basically only after doing the equivalent of dropping the book thousands of times!</p>\n<p>As we approached the final printing of the NKS book, there were other decisions to be made. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--endpapers/'>endpapers</a> were going to have a rule 30 pattern printed on them. But what color should they be? We considered several, picking the goldenrod in the end (and somehow that color now seems to have become the standard for the endpapers of all books I write):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='283' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='22_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the late stages of writing the NKS book one of the big concerns was just how long the book would eventually be. We’d figured out the paper, the binding, and so on. And there was one hard constraint: the binding machines that we were going to use could only bind a book up to a certain thickness. With our specs the limit was 80 signatures—or 1280 pages. The main text clocked in at 1197 pages; with front matter, etc. that was 1213 pages. But then there was the index. And I was writing a very extensive index, that threatened to overrun our absolute maximum page count. We formatted the index in 4 columns as small and tight as we thought we could. And in the end it came in just under the wire: the book was 1280 pages, with not a single page to spare. (Somewhat simplifying the story, I’ve sometimes said that after a decade of work on the NKS book, I had to stop because otherwise I was going to have a book that was too long to bind!) </p>\n<h2 id='the-great-printing-adventure'>The Great Printing Adventure</h2>\n<p>High-quality printing of the kind needed for the NKS book was then—and is now—often done in the Far East. But anticipating that we might need to reprint the book fairly quickly we didn’t consider that an option; it would just take too long to transport books by boat across the Pacific. And conveniently enough, we determined that there was a cost-effective North American alternative: print the book in Canada. And so it was that we chose a printer in Winnipeg, Canada, to print the NKS book.</p>\n<p>On February 7, 2002, the files for the book (which were now PDF, not pure PostScript) were transferred (via FTP) to the printer’s computers—a process which took a mere 90 minutes. (Well, it had to be done twice, because of an initial glitch.) But then the next step was to produce “proofs” for the book. In traditional printing, where printing plates were made from film, one could produce the film first, then make a photographic print of this, check it, and only then make the plates. But we were going to be making plates directly. So for us, “proofing” was a more digital process, that involved using a separate device from the one that would actually make the plates. Supposedly, though, “the bits were the bits”, and the results would be the same.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of days, the printer had the first proofs made, and a few issues were seen—such as white labels inside black cells simply disappearing. The cause was subtle, though didn’t take a long time to find. Some 3D graphics in the book had generated color PostScript—and in all our tests so far these had just automatically been converted to grayscale. But now the presence of color primitives had made the RIP that was converting from PostScript change its settings—and cause other problems. But soon that was worked around, and generating proofs continued. </p>\n<p>By February 14 we had the first batch of proofs in our hands, and my team and I went to work going through them.

But this problem at least we could understand—and it was our fault. Instead of setting the thickness of the arrow in some absolute way, we’d just set it to be “1 pixel”—which in the final printing was too thin to see.</p>\n<p>But what about the other glitches? What were they? And might there be more of them?</p>\n<p>The signatures from the book were ready to start being bound. Should we hold off and reprint the signatures where we’d found glitches? Could we do this without blowing our (already very tight) schedule? Could we even get enough extra paper in time? My team was adamant that we should try to fix the glitches, saying that otherwise they would “nag at us forever”. But I wanted first to see if we could characterize the bug better.</p>\n<p>We knew it was associated with the rendering of the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/PostScript-Language-Reference-Manual-ADOBE/dp/0201101742' target=_blank rel=noopener>PostScript</a> <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator. Even though PostScript is basically a vector graphics description language, the <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator allows one to include bitmaps. Normally these bitmaps are used to represent things like photographs, and have tiny (“few-pixel”) cells. But in the cellular-automaton-like images we were having trouble with, the cells were much larger; in the case of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p157--continuous-cellular-automata/'>page 157</a>, for example, each one was roughly 75 of the final 2400-dpi pixels across. This was absolutely something the <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator was set up to handle. But somehow something was going wrong.</p>\n<p>And what was particularly surprising is that it seemed as if the problem was happening after the PostScript was converted to a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/TIFF.html'>TIFF</a>. Could it perhaps be in the driver for both the proofing and the final plate production system? Time was short, and we needed to make a decision about what to do.</p>\n<p>I fired off an email to the CEO of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creo_(company)' target=_blank rel=noopener>company that made the direct-to-plate system</a>, saying: &#8220;We of course do not know the details of your software and hardware systems. However, we have done a little investigation. It appears that the data &#8230; in the case of this image is a bilevel TIFF with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p565/'>LZW compression</a>. We speculate that the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1072a/'>LZW dictionary</a> contains something close to the actual squares seen in the image, and that somehow pointers to dictionary entries are being corrupted or are not being used correctly in the decompression of the TIFF. The TIFF experts at my company say they have never seen anything like this in developing software based on standard imaging libraries, making us suspect that it may be some kind of buffering or motion optimization bug associated with your actual hardware driver.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The CEO of what was by then quite a large company had personally designed the original hardware, and when we talked by phone he speculated that what we were seeing might be some kind of obscure mechanical issue with the hardware. But his chief of software soon sent mail explaining that “of the several hundred thousand books that go through [their system] each year, there are a couple that have imaging problems like this.” But, he added, “Usually they are books about halftone screening algorithms, which cause an almost-recursive problem&#8230;”. He said the specific issue we were having looked like a “difficult to reproduce problem we have known about for some time but is transient enough that re-imaging the same file can ‘correct’ the problem.” He added that: “Our hypothesis is that it is related to a memory access error in the RIP that manifests only at low-memory conditions, or after many allocation/deallocation cycles of RAM blocks. The particular code path is not one we have source-code access to, and is rumored to be many years old, so not many people on earth are prepared to make substantive changes to it.”</p>\n<p>OK, so what next? The RIP had been developed by Adobe, creators of PostScript. So I emailed <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=john+warnock'>John Warnock</a>, co-founder of Adobe, who I’d met at quite a few software-industry get-togethers before my NKS-book “hermit period”. I commented that “One thing that’s peculiar (at least without knowing how the RIP works) is that the glitch involves overwriting of a column &#8230; even though scanning the underlying PostScript would involve going from one row to the next.” Warnock responded helpfully, copying his team, though saying (in an echo of what we’d already heard) “I don’t know who does PostScript stuff anymore”. </p>\n<p>Well, that seemed like pretty much the end of the road. So we decided to assume that the glitches we’d found were the only ones, and—for perfection’s sake—we’d reprint those signatures, which by that point the printer had helpfully said they could do without blowing the schedule.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Adobe delivered a new version of the RIP, in which they believed the bug had been fixed, noting that there had been significant code cleanup, and they were now using a newer version of the C++ compiler. Meanwhile, I’d realized another issue: a variety of magazines had requested files from us to be able to print high-resolution images from the book. Would they end up using the same software pipeline, and potentially have the same problem? A general release of any fix was still quite far away. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, with the two “glitch” signatures reprinted, the book was off to be bound. The cover had also been printed, now making use of all four stations of the presses. Under a microscope the characteristic <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1078b/'>&#8220;rosettes&#8221; of 4-color printing</a> are visible:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='366' height='291' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Actually, the book in a sense has two covers: a detachable dust jacket (including a dated picture of me!) and a “permanent” hard cover—which I think looks very nice:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/709577304?h=1fb80366b2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>But as I was just now looking back through my archives I found an email from February 2002, expressing concerns about the fading of ink on the cover. The printer assured us that we had “nothing to worry about unless the books were exposed to direct sunlight for an extended amount of time.” But then they added “The reds and yellows will fade faster that the other pigments, but this is not something that would be noticeable in the first 20–40 years.” Well, it’s now been 20 years, and it so happens that I have a copy of the NKS book that’s been exposed to sunlight for much of that time—and look what’s happened to its spine, right on cue:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='319' height='165' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I received a first, hand-bound, finished NKS book on April 22. And very soon books were on their way to bookstores and distribution centers. And people were ordering the book—in large numbers. And that meant that the books we’d printed so far weren’t going to be enough. And on May 12—two days before the May 14 official publication date of the book—another print run was started. </p>\n<p>Fortunately it was possible to reuse the plates from the first print run (well, apart from the one which said “First printing”), so we didn’t have to worry about new glitches showing up. </p>\n<p>But once the book was published, demand continued to be strong, and on June 4 we needed to do another print run. And this time new plates had to be made. Were there going to be new glitches? We decided we should check the plates before we started printing—so we sent the person who’d caught the glitches before on a trip to Canada. Turns out the bug hadn’t yet been fixed, and there it was again on pages <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p583--visual-perception/'>583</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p979--the-phenomenon-of-continuity/'>979</a>. </p>\n<p>Some time later I heard that the bug was finally found and fixed, and had been lurking in the implementation of the PostScript <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator for well over a decade. Yes, software is hard. And computational irreducibility is rampant. But in the years since the NKS book was published, no other weird glitches like this have ever shown up. Or at least nobody has ever told us about any.</p>\n<p>But as I was writing this, I wondered: what became of that other glitch that was in the first printing—the one with the thin arrows that was our fault? I opened an NKS book from my desk. No problem.

We’d just initiated a second printing, which would be finished in a few weeks. But based on apparent demand that printing wasn’t going to be sufficient. And in fact a single bookstore chain had just offered to buy the whole second printing. We initiated a third printing on June 4, and then a fourth on June 18. But if we were going to keep the momentum of sales, we knew we had to keep feeding books into the channel.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s where things got difficult again. It just didn&#8217;t seem possible to get enough books, quickly enough. But after everything we’d done to this point, I wasn’t going to be stopped here. And I went into full “hands-on CEO” mode, trying to see how to juggle logistics to make things work. </p>\n<p>The paper mill was in Glens Falls, NY. Once the paper had been made, it had to be trucked 2752 km to the printer in Winnipeg, Canada. Then the finished “book blocks” had to go 2225 km to the bindery in Toronto (or maybe there was an alternative bindery in Portland, OR, 2400 km away). And finally the bound books had to come to our warehouse in Illinois, or go directly to book distribution centers. </p>\n<p>My archives contain a diagram I made trying to see how to connect these things together, particularly in view of the impending Canada Day holiday on July 1:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='566' height='524' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I have pages and pages of notes, with details of ink drying times (1 day), sheets of paper per skid (20,000), people needed per shift, and so on.

At last it was figured out: multiple truckloads of books had somehow been misplaced at the distribution center. (How do you lose something that big?) And, yes, some sales momentum was lost.

Particularly from the early years of the project, there are endless photographs—and investigations—of examples of complexity in nature, which never made it into <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>Chapter 8</a>. There are also lots of additional results about specific systems from the computational universe—as well as lots of details about history—that could have been notes to the notes, except I didn’t have those.</p>\n<p>Something I didn’t remember is that in 1999—as the book was nearing completion—I considered adding a pictorial “Quick Summary” at the front of the book, here in draft form:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/20.01.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='584' height='680' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I’m not sure if this would have been a good idea, but in the end it effectively got replaced by the textual “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-1--the-foundations-for-a-new-kind-of-science#sect-1-1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas'>An Outline of Basic Ideas</a>” that appears at the very beginning of the book. Still, right when the book was being published, I did produce an “outside the book” <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/CAandNature.pdf'>pictorial 1-pager</a> about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>Chapter 2</a> that saw quite a bit of use, especially for media briefings:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='398' height='553' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But as I was looking through my archives, my biggest “rediscovery” is the “Epilog” to the book. There are versions of it from quite early in the development of the book, but the last time it appears is in the December 15, 2000, draft—right before “Alpha 1”. Then it’s gone. Well, that is, until I just found it again:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='339' height='435' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So what’s in this “lost epilog”, with its intriguing title “The Future of the Science in This Book”?

But it’s interesting to see how what I jotted down more than 20 years ago has actually panned out. And in fact I think much of it is surprisingly close to the mark. Plenty of small extensions did indeed get made in the first few years, with larger ones—both in studying abstract systems and in building practical models—coming later. (One notable extension was the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/10/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/'>2,3 Turing machine universality proof</a> at year 5, stimulated by our <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/'>2,3 Turing Machine Prize</a>.) </p>\n<p>How about “major new directions”? We’re remarkably “on cue” there. At year 18 was our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>Physics Project</a>, and from that has emerged the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>, which I consider to be the next major direction building on the ideas of the NKS book. I have to say that when I wrote down these expectations 20+ years ago, I didn’t imagine that I would personally be involved in the “major new direction” I mentioned—but, unexpected as it has been, I feel very fortunate that that’s the way it’s worked out. </p>\n<p>What about technology? Already at year 7 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> was in many ways a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2009/05/7-years-of-nks-and-its-first-killer-app/'>major &#8220;philosophical spinoff&#8221;</a> of the NKS book. And although one doesn’t know its detailed origins, the proof-of-work concept of bitcoin (which also first appeared at year 7) has fundamental connections to the idea of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>. Meanwhile, the general methodology of searching the computational universe for useful programs is something that has continued to grow. And although the details are more complicated, the whole notion of deep learning in neural nets <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#machine-learning-and-the-neural-net-renaissance'>can also be thought of as related</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s very hard to assess just what’s happened in “becoming a part of everyday thought”—though it’s been wonderful over the years to run into so many people who’ve told me how much the NKS book affected their way of thinking about things. But my impression is that—despite quite a few specific applications—the truly widespread absorption of ideas like computational irreducibility and their implications is a bit “behind schedule”, though definitely now building well. (One piece of absorption that did happen in the 4–10 year window was into areas like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/06/oh-my-gosh-its-covered-in-rule-30s/'>art and architecture</a>.)</p>\n<p>What about education? 1D cellular automata have certainly become widely used as “do-a-little-extra” examples for both programming and math. But more serious integration of ideas from the NKS book as foundational elements of computational thinking—or as a kind of “pre-computer science”—is basically still a “work in progress”.</p>\n<p>Beyond the main text of the “lost epilog”, I found something else: “Notes for the Epilog”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img9.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img9.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='574' height='275' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And after short (and unfinished) notes on “The sociology of the new science” and “The role of amateurs”, there’s the most significant “find”: a list of altogether 283 “Open questions” for each of the chapters of the book, most still unanswered. </p>\n<p>In preparation for our first <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Wolfram Summer School</a> (then called the NKS Summer School) in June 2003, I worked on a more detailed version of something similar—but left it incomplete after getting up to the middle of Chapter 4, and didn’t include much if anything from the “Notes to the Epilog” even though I’d been accumulating those for much of the time I worked on the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img10.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img10.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='221' height='283' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img10_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='10_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='10_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>During the decade I worked on the NKS book I generated a vast amount of material. Most of it I kept in my still-very-much-extant computer filesystem, and while I can’t say that I’ve reexamined everything there, my impression is that—perhaps apart from some “notes to the notes” material—a large fraction of what should have made it into the NKS book did. But in the course of working on the book there was definitely quite a bit of more ephemeral material. Some was preserved in my computer filesystem. But some was printed out and discarded, and some was simply handwritten. But all these years I’ve kept archive boxes of that material.</p>\n<p>Some of those boxes have now been sealed for nearly 30 years. But I thought it’d be interesting to see what they contain. So I pulled out a box labeled 6/93–10/93. It’s slightly the worse for wear after all these years, but what’s inside is well preserved. I turn over a few pages of notes, printouts and ancient company memos (some sent as faxes). And then: what’s this? </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img11.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img11.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='578' height='364' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img11_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='11_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='11_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s a note about multiway systems: things that are now central to the multicomputational paradigm I’ve just been pursuing.

But back then there’d been a big rush to get books to bookstores, but on the actual “day of publication” there wasn’t much for me to do.</p>\n<p>It had been a long journey getting to this point, though, and for example the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/pxii--preface/'>acknowledgements at the front of the book</a> listed 376 people who’d helped in one way or another over the decade devoted to writing the book, or in the years beforehand. But in terms of the physical production of the book one clue about what had been involved could be found on the very last page—<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/colophon/'>its “Colophon</a>&rdquo;:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='397' height='527' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And, yes, as I’ve explained here, there was quite a story behind the simple paragraph: “The book was printed on 50-pound Finch VHF paper on a sheet-fed press. It was imaged directly to plates at 2400 dpi, with halftones rendered using a 175-line screen with round dots angled at 45°. The binding was Smythe sewn.” And whatever other awards the book would win, it was rather lovely to win one for its creative use of paper: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img2.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='225' height='269' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So much about the NKS book was unusual. It was a book about new discoveries on the frontiers of science written for anyone to read. It was a book full of algorithmic pictures like none seen before. It was a book about science produced to a level of quality probably never equaled except by books about art.

For 20 years we’ve meticulously tracked them. And I think it’s fair to say that all the careful checking we did originally really paid off, because in all the text and pictures in the book remarkably few errors have been found. For example, here’s the list of everything in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-4--systems-based-on-numbers/'>Chapter 4</a>, indicating a few errors that were fixed in early printings—and a couple that remain, and that we are now fixing online:</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img15.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img15.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='210' /></a></p>\n<p>People ask me if there’ll be a second edition of the NKS book. I say no. Yes, there are gradually starting to be more things one can say—and in the past couple of years the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a> and the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> has added significantly more. But there’s nothing wrong with what’s in the NKS book. It remains as valid and coherent as it was 20 years ago. And any “second-edition surgery” would run the risk of degrading its crispness and integrity—and detract from its unique perspective of presenting science at the time of its discovery. </p>\n<p>But, OK, so all those NKS books that were printed on all those tons of paper from hemlock trees 20 years ago: what happened to them? Looking on the web today, one can find a few out there in the wild, sitting on bookshelves alongside a remarkable variety of other books:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img16.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='466' /></a></p>\n<p>I myself have many NKS books on my shelves (though admittedly a few more as convenient 2.5-inch “filler bookends”). And—at least when I’m in a “science phase”—I find myself using the online NKS book (if not a physical book) all the time, to see an example of some remarkable phenomenon in the computational universe, or to remind myself of some elaborate explanation or result that I put so much effort into finding all those years ago.</p>\n<p>I consider the NKS book one the great achievements of my life—as well as one of the great “stepping-stone” points in my life, that was made possible by what I’d done before, and that in turn has made possible what I’ve done since. Twenty years later it’s interesting to think back—as I’ve done here—on just what it took to produce the NKS book, and how all those individual steps that I worked so hard on for a decade came together to make the whole that is the NKS book. </p>\n<p>To me it’s a satisfying and inspiring story of what can be achieved with clear vision, sustained effort and a willingness to go where discoveries lead. And as I reflect on achievements of the past it makes me all the more enthusiastic about what’s now possible—and why it’s worth putting great effort today into what we can now build for the future. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kind-Science-Twentieth-Anniversary-Collection/dp/1579550568/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GL9BLLSBPEAF&#038;keywords=new+kind+of+science+20th&#038;qid=1652459905&#038;s=books&#038;sprefix=new+kind+of+science+20th%2Cstripbooks%2C80&#038;sr=1-1\" target='blank'><img class=\"\" title=\"A New Kind of Science Twentieth Anniversary Collection\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw-writing-banner-ad.png\" alt=\"A New Kind of Science Twentieth Anniversary Collection\" width=\"620\" height=\"185\" /></a></p>\n",

We might have imagined that physics would have certain laws, and mathematics would have certain theories, and that while they might be historically related, there wouldn’t be any fundamental formal correspondence between them. </p>\n<p>But what our Physics Project suggests is that underneath everything we physically experience there is a single very general abstract structure—that we call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>—and that our physical laws arise in an inexorable way from the particular samples we take of this structure. We can think of the ruliad as the entangled limit of all possible computations—or in effect a representation of all possible formal processes. And this then leads us to the idea that perhaps the ruliad might underlie not only physics but also mathematics—and that everything in mathematics, like everything in physics, might just be the result of sampling the ruliad. <span id=\"more-34645\"></span></p>\n<p><a name='mathematical-observer'></a>Of course, mathematics as it’s normally practiced doesn’t look the same as physics. But the idea is that they can both be seen as views of the same underlying structure. What makes them different is that physical and mathematical observers sample this structure in somewhat different ways. But since in the end both kinds of observers are associated with human experience they inevitably have certain core characteristics in common. And the result is that there should be “fundamental laws of mathematics” that in some sense mirror the perceived laws of physics that we derive from our physical observation of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>So what might those fundamental laws of mathematics be like? And how might they inform our conception of the foundations of mathematics, and our view of what mathematics really is?</p>\n<p>The most obvious manifestation of the mathematics that we humans have developed over the course of many centuries is the few million mathematical theorems that have been published in the literature of mathematics. But what can be said in generality about this thing we call mathematics? Is there some notion of what mathematics is like “in bulk”? And what might we be able to say, for example, about the structure of mathematics in the limit of infinite future development?</p>\n<p>When we do physics, the traditional approach has been to start from our basic sensory experience of the physical world, and of concepts like space, time and motion—and then to try to formalize our descriptions of these things, and build on these formalizations. And in its early development—for example by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>Euclid</a>—mathematics took the same basic approach. But beginning a little more than a century ago there emerged the idea that one could build mathematics purely from formal axioms, without necessarily any reference to what is accessible to sensory experience.</p>\n<p>And in a way our Physics Project begins from a similar place. Because at the outset it just considers purely abstract structures and abstract rules—typically described in terms of hypergraph rewriting—and then tries to deduce their consequences. Many of these consequences are incredibly complicated, and full of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>. But the remarkable discovery is that when sampled by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers with certain general characteristics that make them like us</a>, the behavior that emerges must generically have regularities that we can recognize, and in fact must follow exactly known core laws of physics.</p>\n<p>And already this begins to suggest a new perspective to apply to the foundations of mathematics. But there’s another piece, and that’s the idea of the ruliad. We might have supposed that our universe is based on some particular chosen underlying rule, like an axiom system we might choose in mathematics. But the concept of the ruliad is in effect to represent the entangled result of “running all possible rules”. And the key point is then that it turns out that an “observer like us” sampling the ruliad must perceive behavior that corresponds to known laws of physics. In other words, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>without “making any choice” it&#8217;s inevitable</a>—given what we’re like as observers—that our “experience of the ruliad” will show fundamental laws of physics.</p>\n<p>But now we can make a bridge to mathematics. Because in embodying all possible computational processes the ruliad also necessarily embodies the consequences of all possible axiom systems. As humans doing physics we’re effectively taking a certain sampling of the ruliad. And we realize that as humans doing mathematics we’re also doing essentially the same kind of thing. </p>\n<p>But will we see “general laws of mathematics” in the same kind of way that we see “general laws of physics”? It depends on what we’re like as “mathematical observers”. In physics, there turn out to be general laws—and concepts like space and motion—that we humans can assimilate. And in the abstract it might not be that anything similar would be true in mathematics. But it seems as if the thing mathematicians typically call mathematics is something for which it is—and where (usually in the end leveraging our experience of physics) it’s possible to successfully carve out a sampling of the ruliad that’s again one we humans can assimilate. </p>\n<p>When we think about physics we have the idea that there’s an actual physical reality that exists—and that we experience physics within this. But in the formal axiomatic view of mathematics, things are different. There’s no obvious “underlying reality” there; instead there’s just a certain choice we make of axiom system. But now, with the concept of the ruliad, the story is different. Because now we have the idea that “deep underneath” both physics and mathematics there’s the same thing: the ruliad. And that means that insofar as physics is “grounded in reality”, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>so also must mathematics be</a>.</p>\n<p>When most working mathematicians do mathematics it seems to be typical for them to reason as if the constructs they’re dealing with (whether they be numbers or sets or whatever) are “real things”. But usually there’s a concept that in principle one could “drill down” and formalize everything in terms of some axiom system. And indeed if one wants to get a global view of mathematics and its structure as it is today, it seems as if the best approach is to work from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p773--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>formalization that’s been done with axiom systems</a>.</p>\n<p>In starting from the ruliad and the ideas of our Physics Project we’re in effect positing a certain “theory of mathematics”. And to validate this theory we need to study the “phenomena of mathematics”. And, yes, we could do this in effect by directly “reading the whole literature of mathematics”. But it’s more efficient to start from what’s in a sense the “current prevailing underlying theory of mathematics” and to begin by building on the methods of formalized mathematics and axiom systems.</p>\n<p>Over the past century a certain amount of metamathematics has been done by looking at the general properties of these methods. But most often when the methods are systematically used today, it’s to set up some particular mathematical derivation, normally with the aid of a computer. But here what we want to do is think about what happens if the methods are used “in bulk”. Underneath there may be all sorts of specific detailed formal derivations being done. But somehow what emerges from this is something higher level, something “more human”—and ultimately something that corresponds to our experience of pure mathematics.</p>\n<p>How might this work? We can get an idea from an analogy in physics. Imagine we have a gas. Underneath, it consists of zillions of molecules bouncing around in detailed and complicated patterns. But most of our “human” experience of the gas is at a much more coarse-grained level—where we perceive not the detailed motions of individual molecules, but instead continuum fluid mechanics.</p>\n<p>And so it is, I think, with mathematics. All those detailed formal derivations—for example of the kind <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>automated theorem proving</a> might do—are like molecular dynamics. But most of our “human experience of mathematics”—where we talk about concepts like integers or morphisms—is like fluid dynamics. The molecular dynamics is what builds up the fluid, but for most questions of “human interest” it’s possible to “reason at the fluid dynamics level”, without dropping down to molecular dynamics.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly not obvious that this would be possible. It could be that one might start off describing things at a “fluid dynamics” level—say in the case of an actual fluid talking about the motion of vortices—but that everything would quickly get “shredded”, and that there’d soon be nothing like a vortex to be seen, only elaborate patterns of detailed microscopic molecular motions. And similarly in mathematics one might imagine that one would be able to prove theorems in terms of things like real numbers but actually find that everything gets “shredded” to the point where one has to start talking about elaborate issues of mathematical logic and different possible axiomatic foundations.</p>\n<p>But in physics we effectively have the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>—which we now <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>understand in terms of computational irreducibility</a>—that tells us that there’s a robust sense in which the microscopic details are systematically “washed out” so that things like fluid dynamics “work”. Just sometimes—like in studying Brownian motion, or hypersonic flow—the molecular dynamics level still “shines through”. But for most “human purposes” we can describe fluids just using ordinary fluid dynamics.</p>\n<p>So what’s the analog of this in mathematics? Presumably it’s that there’s some kind of “general law of mathematics” that explains why one can so often do mathematics “purely in the large”. Just like in fluid mechanics there can be “corner-case” questions that probe down to the “molecular scale”—and indeed that’s where we can expect to see things like undecidability, as a rough analog of situations where we end up tracing the potentially infinite paths of single molecules rather than just looking at “overall fluid effects”. But somehow in most cases there’s some much stronger phenomenon at work—that effectively aggregates low-level details to allow the kind of “bulk description” that ends up being the essence of what we normally in practice call mathematics.</p>\n<p>But is such a phenomenon something formally inevitable, or does it somehow depend on us humans “being in the loop”? In the case of the Second Law it’s crucial that we only get to track coarse-grained features of a gas—as we humans with our current technology typically do. Because if instead we watched and decoded what every individual molecule does, we wouldn’t end up identifying anything like the usual bulk “Second-Law” behavior. In other words, the emergence of the Second Law is in effect a direct consequence of the fact that it’s us humans—with our limitations on measurement and computation—who are observing the gas.</p>\n<p>So is something similar happening with mathematics? At the underlying “molecular level” there’s a lot going on. But the way we humans think about things, we’re effectively taking just particular kinds of samples. And those samples turn out to give us “general laws of mathematics” that give us our usual experience of “human-level mathematics”.</p>\n<p><a name='axiomatic-level'></a>To ultimately ground this we have to go down to the fully abstract level of the ruliad, but we’ll already see many core effects by looking at mathematics essentially just at a traditional “axiomatic level”, albeit “in bulk”. </p>\n<p>The full story—and the full correspondence between physics and mathematics—requires in a sense “going below” the level at which we have recognizable formal axiomatic mathematical structures; it requires going to a level at which we’re just talking about making everything out of completely abstract elements, which in physics we might interpret as “atoms of space” and in mathematics as some kind of “symbolic raw material” below variables and operators and everything else familiar in traditional axiomatic mathematics.</p>\n<p>The deep correspondence we’re describing between physics and mathematics might make one wonder to what extent the methods we use in physics can be applied to mathematics, and vice versa. In axiomatic mathematics the emphasis tends to be on looking at particular theorems and seeing how they can be knitted together with proofs. And one could certainly imagine an analogous “axiomatic physics” in which one does particular experiments, then sees how they can “deductively” be knitted together. But our impression that there’s an “actual reality” to physics makes us seek broader laws. And the correspondence between physics and mathematics implied by the ruliad now suggests that we should be doing this in mathematics as well.</p>\n<p>What will we find? Some of it in essence just confirms impressions that working pure mathematicians already have. But it provides a definite framework for understanding these impressions and for seeing what their limits may be. It also lets us address questions like why undecidability is so comparatively rare in practical pure mathematics, and why it is so common to discover remarkable correspondences between apparently quite different areas of mathematics. And beyond that, it suggests a host of new questions and approaches both to mathematics and metamathematics—that help frame the foundations of the remarkable intellectual edifice that we call mathematics. </p>\n<h2 id='the-underlying-structure-of-mathematics-and-physics'><span>2 | </span>The Underlying Structure of Mathematics and Physics</h2>\n<p>If we “drill down” to what we’ve called above the “molecular level” of mathematics, what will we find there? There are many technical details (some of which we’ll discuss later) about the historical conventions of mathematics and its presentation. But in broad outline we can think of there as being a kind of “gas” of “mathematical statements”—like 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 or <em>x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>x</em>—represented in some specified symbolic language. (And, yes, <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> provides a well-developed example of what that language can be like.)</p>\n<p>But how does the “gas of statements” behave? The essential point is that new statements are derived from existing ones by “interactions” that implement laws of inference (like that <em>q</em> can be derived from the statement <em>p</em> and the statement “<em>p</em> implies <em>q</em>”). And if we trace the paths by which one statement can be derived from others, these correspond to proofs. And the whole graph of all these derivations is then a representation of the possible historical development of mathematics—with slices through this graph corresponding to the sets of statements reached at a given stage.</p>\n<p>By talking about things like a “gas of statements” we’re making this sound a bit like physics. But while in physics a gas consists of actual, physical molecules, in mathematics our statements are just abstract things. But this is where the discoveries of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> start to be important. Because in our project we’re “drilling down” beneath for example the usual notions of space and time to an “ultimate machine code” for the physical universe. And we can think of that ultimate machine code as operating on things that are in effect just abstract constructs—very much like in mathematics.</p>\n<p>In particular, we imagine that space and everything in it is made up of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>giant network (hypergraph) of “atoms of space”</a>—with each “atom of space” just being an abstract element that has certain relations with other elements. The evolution of the universe in time then corresponds to the application of computational rules that (much like laws of inference) take abstract relations and yield new relations—thereby progressively updating the network that represents space and everything in it.</p>\n<p>But while the individual rules may be very simple, the whole detailed pattern of behavior to which they lead is normally very complicated—and typically shows <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>, so that there’s no way to systematically find its outcome except in effect by explicitly tracing each step. But despite all this underlying complexity it turns out—much like in the case of an ordinary gas—that at a coarse-grained level there are much simpler (“bulk”) laws of behavior that one can identify. And the remarkable thing is that these turn out to be exactly general relativity and quantum mechanics (which, yes, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>end up being the same theory</a> when looked at in terms of an appropriate generalization of the notion of space). </p>\n<p>But down at the lowest level, is there some specific computational rule that’s “running the universe”? I don’t think so. Instead, I think that in effect all possible rules are always being applied. And the result is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>: the entangled structure associated with performing all possible computations. </p>\n<p>But what then gives us our experience of the universe and of physics? Inevitably we are observers embedded within the ruliad, sampling only certain features of it. But what features we sample are determined by the characteristics of us as observers. And what seem to be critical to have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>“observers like us” are basically two characteristics</a>. First, that we are computationally bounded. And second, that we somehow persistently maintain our coherence—in the sense that we can consistently identify what constitutes “us” even though the detailed atoms of space involved are continually changing.</p>\n<p><a name='rulial-space'></a>But we can think of different “observers like us” as taking different specific samples, corresponding to different reference frames in rulial space, or just different positions in rulial space. These different observers may describe the universe as evolving according to different specific underlying rules. But the crucial point is that the general structure of the ruliad implies that so long as the observers are “like us”, it’s inevitable that their perception of the universe will be that it follows things like general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>It’s very much like what happens with a gas of molecules: to an “observer like us” there are the same gas laws and the same laws of fluid dynamics essentially independent of the detailed structure of the individual molecules. </p>\n<p>So what does all this mean for mathematics? The crucial and at first surprising point is that the ideas we’re describing in physics can in effect immediately be carried over to mathematics. And the key is that the ruliad represents not only all physics, but also all mathematics—and it shows that these are not just related, but in some sense fundamentally the same.</p>\n<p>In the traditional formulation of axiomatic mathematics, one talks about deriving results from particular axiom systems—say <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--axioms-for-arithmetic/'>Peano Arithmetic</a>, or <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC set theory</a>, or the axioms of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>Euclidean geometry</a>. But the ruliad in effect represents the entangled consequences not just of specific axiom systems but of all possible axiom systems (as well as all possible laws of inference). </p>\n<p>But from this structure that in a sense corresponds to all possible mathematics, how do we pick out any particular mathematics that we’re interested in? The answer is that just as we are limited observers of the physical universe, so we are also limited observers of the “mathematical universe”. </p>\n<p>But what are we like as “mathematical observers”? As I’ll argue in more detail later, we inherit our core characteristics from those we exhibit as “physical observers”. And that means that when we “do mathematics” we’re effectively sampling the ruliad in much the same way as when we “do physics”. </p>\n<p>We can operate in different rulial reference frames, or at different locations in rulial space, and these will correspond to picking out different underlying “rules of mathematics”, or essentially using different axiom systems. But now we can make use of the correspondence with physics to say that we can also expect there to be certain “overall laws of mathematics” that are the result of general features of the ruliad as perceived by observers like us.</p>\n<p>And indeed we can expect that in some formal sense these overall laws will have exactly the same structure as those in physics—so that in effect in mathematics we’ll have something like the notion of space that we have in physics, as well as formal analogs of things like general relativity and quantum mechanics. </p>\n<p>What does this mean? It implies that—just as it’s possible to have coherent “higher-level descriptions” in physics that don’t just operate down at the level of atoms of space, so also this should be possible in mathematics. And this in a sense is why we can expect to consistently do what I described above as “human-level mathematics”, without usually having to drop down to the “molecular level” of specific axiomatic structures (or below).</p>\n<p>Say we’re talking about the Pythagorean theorem. Given some particular detailed axiom system for mathematics we can imagine using it to build up a precise—if potentially very long and pedantic—representation of the theorem. But let’s say we change some detail of our axioms, say associated with the way they talk about sets, or real numbers. We’ll almost certainly still be able to build up something we consider to be “the Pythagorean theorem”—even though the details of the representation will be different.</p>\n<p>In other words, this thing that we as humans would call “the Pythagorean theorem” is not just a single point in the ruliad, but a whole cloud of points. And now the question is: what happens if we try to derive other results from the Pythagorean theorem? It might be that each particular representation of the theorem—corresponding to each point in the cloud—would lead to quite different results. But it could also be that essentially the whole cloud would coherently lead to the same results.</p>\n<p>And the claim from the correspondence with physics is that there should be “general laws of mathematics” that apply to “observers like us” and that ensure that there’ll be coherence between all the different specific representations associated with the cloud that we identify as “the Pythagorean theorem”.</p>\n<p>In physics it could have been that we’d always have to separately say what happens to every atom of space. But we know that there’s a coherent higher-level description of space—in which for example we can just imagine that objects can move while somehow maintaining their identity. And we can now expect that it’s the same kind of thing in mathematics: that just as there’s a coherent notion of space in physics where things can for example move without being “shredded”, so also this will happen in mathematics. And this is why it’s possible to do “higher-level mathematics” without always dropping down to the lowest level of axiomatic derivations.</p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that even in physical space a concept like “pure motion” in which objects can move while maintaining their identity doesn’t always work. For example, close to a spacetime singularity, one can expect to eventually be forced to see through to the discrete structure of space—and for any “object” to inevitably be “shredded”. But most of the time it’s possible for observers like us to maintain the idea that there are coherent large-scale features whose behavior we can study using “bulk” laws of physics.</p>\n<p>And we can expect the same kind of thing to happen with mathematics. Later on, we’ll discuss more specific correspondences between phenomena in physics and mathematics—and we’ll see the effects of things like general relativity and quantum mechanics in mathematics, or, more precisely, in metamathematics. </p>\n<p>But for now, the key point is that we can think of mathematics as somehow being made of exactly the same stuff as physics: they’re both just features of the ruliad, as sampled by observers like us. And in what follows we’ll see the great power that arises from using this to combine the achievements and intuitions of physics and mathematics—and how this lets us think about new “general laws of mathematics”, and view the ultimate foundations of mathematics in a different light.</p>\n<h2 id='the-metamodeling-of-axiomatic-mathematics'><span>3 | </span>The Metamodeling of Axiomatic Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Consider all the mathematical statements that have appeared in mathematical books and papers. We can view these in some sense as the “observed phenomena” of (human) mathematics. And if we’re going to make a “general theory of mathematics” a first step is to do something like we’d typically do in natural science, and try to “drill down” to find a uniform underlying model—or at least representation—for all of them.</p>\n<p>At the outset, it might not be clear what sort of representation could possibly capture all those different mathematical statements. But what’s emerged over the past century or so—with particular clarity in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> and the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>—is that there is in fact a rather simple and general representation that works remarkably well: a representation in which everything is a symbolic expression. </p>\n<p>One can view a symbolic expression such as <tt>f[g[x][y, h[z]], w]</tt> as a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/33-expressions-and-their-structure.html'>hierarchical or tree structure</a>, in which at every level some particular “head” (like <tt>f</tt>) is “applied to” one or more arguments. Often in practice one deals with expressions in which the heads have “known meanings”—as in <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Times.html'>Times</a>[<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a>[2, 3], 4]</tt> in Wolfram Language. And with this kind of setup symbolic expressions are reminiscent of human natural language, with the heads basically corresponding to “known words” in the language. </p>\n<p>And presumably it’s this familiarity from human natural language that’s caused “human natural mathematics” to develop in a way that can so readily be represented by symbolic expressions. </p>\n<p>But in typical mathematics there’s an important wrinkle. One often wants to make statements not just about particular things but about whole classes of things. And it’s common to then just declare that some of the “symbols” (like, say, <em>x</em>) that appear in an expression are “variables”, while others (like, say, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a></tt>) are not. But in our effort to capture the essence of mathematics as uniformly as possible it seems much better to burn the idea of an object representing a whole class of things right into the structure of the symbolic expression. </p>\n<p><a name='pattern-expression'></a>And indeed this is a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/32-patterns.html'>core idea in the Wolfram Language</a>, where something like <em>x</em> or <tt>f</tt> is just a “symbol that stands for itself”, while <em>x_</em> is a pattern (named <em>x</em>) that can stand for anything. (More precisely, <em>_</em> on its own is what stands for “anything”, and <em>x_</em>—which can also be written <em>x:_</em>—just says that whatever <em>_</em> stands for in a particular instance will be called <em>x</em>.) </p>\n<p>Then with this notation an example of a “mathematical statement” might be: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/04-sw0219img1.png\" alt='' title='' width='170' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/04-sw0219img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='04-1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='04-1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In more explicit form we could write this as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Equal.html'>Equal</a>[f[x_, y_], f[f[y_, x_],y_]]</tt>&mdash;where <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Equal.html'>Equal</a></tt> (<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-equalA.png\" width= '13' height='23' align='absmiddle'></span>) has the “known meaning” of representing equality.

But what if we are given a statement, and asked whether it can be proved within the specified axiom system? In effect this asks whether if we make a sufficiently large multiway graph we can find a path of any length that corresponds to the statement.</p>\n<p>If our system was computationally reducible we could expect always to be able to find a finite answer to this question. But in general—with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> and the ubiquitous presence of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>—it’ll be common that there is no fundamentally better way to determine whether a path exists than effectively to try explicitly generating it. If we knew, for example, that the intermediate expressions generated always remained of bounded length, then this would still be a bounded problem.

For example, if one changes an expression at a particular step in the evolution of a multiway system, it can only affect a region of the branchial graph that essentially expands by one edge per step. </p>\n<p><a name='entailment-cone'></a>One can think of the affected region—in analogy with a light cone in spacetime—as being the “entailment cone” of a particular expression. The edge of the entailment cone in effect expands at a certain “maximum metamathematical speed” in metamathematical (i.e. branchial) space—which one can think of as being measured in units of “expression change per multiway step”.</p>\n<p>By analogy with physics one can start talking in general about motion in metamathematical space. A particular proof path in the multiway graph will progressively “move around” in the branchial graph that defines metamathematical space. (Yes, there are many subtle issues here, not least the fact that one has to imagine a certain kind of limit being taken so that the structure of the branchial graph is “stable enough” to “just be moving around” in something like a “fixed background space”.)</p>\n<p>By the way, the shortest proof path in the multiway graph is the analog of a geodesic in spacetime. And later we’ll talk about how the “density of activity” in the branchial graph is the analog of energy in physics, and how it can be seen as “deflecting” the path of geodesics, just as gravity does in spacetime.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning just one further subtlety. Branchial graphs are in effect associated with <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/foliations-of-the-multiway-graph-and-the-structure-of-branchial-space/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“transverse slices”</a> of the multiway graph—but there are many consistent ways to make these slices. In physics terms one can think of the foliations that define different choices of sequences of slices as being like “reference frames” in which one is specifying a sequence of “simultaneity surfaces” (here “branchtime hypersurfaces”). The particular branchial graphs we’ve shown here are ones associated with what in physics might be called the cosmological rest frame in which every node is the result of the same number of updates since the beginning.</p>\n<h2 id='the-issue-of-generated-variables'><span>6 | </span>The Issue of Generated Variables</h2>\n<p>A rule like</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img1A.png\" alt='' title='' width='172' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>defines transformations for any expressions <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img2A.png\" width= '18' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img3A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>.

But between expressions there’s no such constraint.

Because then our final result was the expression <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img30A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> which can match <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img31A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> but not <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img32A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>—whereas now the final result is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img33A.png\" width= '49' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> which can match both <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img34A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img35A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>This may seem like a subtle issue. But it’s critically important in practice. Not least because generated variables are in effect what make up all “truly new stuff” that can be produced. With a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img36A.png\" width= '165' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> one’s essentially just taking whatever one started with, and successively rearranging the pieces of it. But with a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img37A.png\" width= '163' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> there’s something “truly new” generated every time <em>z</em>_ appears. </p>\n<p>By the way, the basic issue of “generated variables” isn’t something specific to the particular symbolic expression setup we’ve been using here. For example, there’s a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-in-our-models/updating-events-and-causal-dependence/' target=_blank rel=noopener>direct analog of it in the hypergraph rewriting systems</a> that appear in our Physics Project. But in that case there’s a particularly clear interpretation: the analog of “generated variables” are new “atoms of space” produced by the application of rules. And far from being some kind of footnote, these “generated atoms of space” are what make up everything we have in our universe today. </p>\n<p>The issue of generated variables—and especially their naming—is the bane of all sorts of formalism for mathematical logic and programming languages. As we’ll see later, it’s perfectly possible to “go to a lower level” and set things up with no names at all, for example using <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>combinators</a>. But without names, things tend to seem quite alien to us humans—and certainly if we want to understand the correspondence with standard presentations of mathematics it’s pretty necessary to have names.

But if everything is a symbolic expression there shouldn’t really need to be a distinction between “rules” and “ordinary expressions”. They’re all just expressions. And so we should as well be able to apply rules to rules as to ordinary expressions.</p>\n<p><a name='two-way-rule'></a>And indeed the concept of “applying rules to rules” is something that has a familiar analog in standard mathematics. The “two-way rules” we’ve been using effectively define equivalences—which are very common kinds of statements in mathematics, though in mathematics they’re usually written with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-equalA.png\" width= '13' height='23' align='absmiddle'></span> rather than with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/double-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width='20' height='22' align='absmiddle'></span>. And indeed, many axioms and many theorems are specified as equivalences—and in equational logic one takes everything to be defined using equivalences. And when one’s dealing with theorems (or axioms) specified as equivalences, the basic way one derives new theorems is by applying one theorem to another—or in effect by applying rules to rules.</p>\n<p>As a specific example, let’s say we have the “axiom”:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img3A.png\" alt='' title='' width='172' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We can now apply this to the rule</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img4A.png\" alt='' title='' width='106' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>to get (where since <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img5A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is equivalent to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img6A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we’re sorting each two-way rule that arises)</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img7A.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='177' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>or after a few more steps:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img8A.png\" alt='' title='' width='552' height='312' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='8-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='8-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In this example all that’s happening is that the substitutions specified by the axiom are getting separately applied to the left- and right-hand sides of each rule that is generated.

But in an effort to maintain contact with standard mathematics we’ll for now have the “meta rule” that <em>x</em>_ can’t match an expression whose top-level operator is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width='20' height='24' align='absmiddle'></span>. (As we’ll discuss later, including such matches would allow us to do exotic things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p815--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>encode set theory within arithmetic</a>, which is again something usually considered to be “syntactically prevented” in mathematical logic.)</p>\n<p>Another—still more obscure—meta rule we have is that <em>x</em>_ can’t “match inside a variable”. In Wolfram Language, for example, <em>a</em>_ has the full form <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Pattern.html'>Pattern</a>[a,<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Blank.html'>Blank</a>[]]</tt>, and one could imagine that <em>x</em>_ could match “internal pieces” of this. But for now, we’re going to treat all variables as atomic—even though later on, when we “descend below the level of variables”, the story will be different. </p>\n<p>When we apply a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img13A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img14A.png\" width= '87' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we’re taking a rule with pattern variables, and doing substitutions with it on a “literal expression” without pattern variables. But it’s also perfectly possible to apply pattern rules to pattern rules<span style=\"font-size:14px\">&mdash;</span>and indeed that’s what we’ll mostly do below. But in this case there’s another subtle issue that can arise.

But when everything is a symbolic expression, it’s perfectly possible—as we saw above—to “treat code like data”, and in particular to generate rules as output. But this now raises a new possibility.

In any given proof we can in principle always just keep using the axioms over and over again—but it’ll be much more efficient to progressively build a library of more and more lemmas, and use these.

actually work in very different ways. The string rule can apply to characters anywhere within a string, but what it inserts is always of fixed size. The expression rule deals with trees, and only applies to “whole subtrees”, but what it inserts can be a tree of any size. (One can align these setups by thinking of strings as expressions in which characters are “bound together” by an associative operator, as in A·B·A·A. But if one explicitly gives associativity axioms these will lead to additional pieces in the token-event graph.)</p>\n<p>A rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/10sw0223img14A.png\" width= '97' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> also has the feature of involving patterns.

The proof is a subgraph of the “relevant part” of the full token-event graph. Often—in analogy to the simpler case of finding proofs of equivalences between expressions in a multiway graph—we’ll call this subgraph a “proof path”. </p>\n<p>But in addition to just “finding a proof” in a fully constructed token-event graph, we can ask whether, given a statement, we can directly construct a proof for it. As discussed in the context of proofs in ordinary multiway graphs, computational irreducibility implies that in general there’s no “shortcut” way to find a proof. In addition, for any statement, there may be no upper bound on the length of proof that will be required (or on the size or number of intermediate “lemmas” that will have to be used). And this, again, is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p779--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>shadow of undecidability in our systems</a>: that there can be statements whose provability may be arbitrarily difficult to determine. </p>\n<h2 id='beyond-substitution-cosubstitution-and-bisubstitution'><span>12 | </span>Beyond Substitution: Cosubstitution and Bisubstitution</h2>\n<p>In making our “metamodel” of mathematics we’ve been discussing the rewriting of expressions according to rules. But there’s a subtle issue that we’ve so far avoided, that has to do with the fact that the expressions we’re rewriting are often themselves patterns that stand for whole classes of expressions. And this turns out to allow for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--substitution-strategies-in-proofs/'>additional kinds of transformations</a> that we’ll call cosubstitution and bisubstitution.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk first about cosubstitution. Imagine we have the expression <tt>f[a]</tt>. The rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img1A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> would do a substitution for <em>a</em> to give <tt>f[b]</tt>. But if we have the expression <tt>f[c]</tt> the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img2A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> will do nothing.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that we have the expression <tt>f[x_]</tt>. This stands for a whole class of expressions, including <tt>f[a]</tt>, <tt>f[c]</tt>, etc. For most of this class of expressions, the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img3A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> will do nothing. But in the specific case of <tt>f[a]</tt>, it applies, and gives the result <tt>f[b]</tt>.</p>\n<p>If our rule is <tt>f[x_]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> then this will apply as an ordinary substitution to <tt>f[a]</tt>, giving the result <em>s</em>. But if the rule is <tt>f[b]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> this will not apply as an ordinary substitution to <tt>f[a]</tt>. However, it can apply as a cosubstitution to <tt>f[x_]</tt> by picking out the specific case where <tt>x_</tt> stands for <em>b</em>, then using the rule to give <em>s</em>.</p>\n<p>In general, the point is that ordinary substitution specializes patterns that appear in rules—while what one can think of as the “dual operation” of cosubstitution specializes patterns that appear in the expressions to which the rules are being applied. If one thinks of the rule that’s being applied as like an operator, and the expression to which the rule is being applied as an operand, then in effect substitution is about making the operator fit the operand, and cosubstitution is about making the operand fit the operator.</p>\n<p>It’s important to realize that as soon as one’s operating on expressions involving patterns, cosubstitution is not something “optional”: it’s something that one has to include if one is really going to interpret patterns—wherever they occur—as standing for classes of expressions.</p>\n<p>When one’s operating on a literal expression (without patterns) only substitution is ever possible, as in</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img4A.png\" alt='' title='' width='201' height='27' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/13sw0223img4X_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4X-13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4X-13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>corresponding to this fragment of a token-event graph:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img5A.png\" alt='' title='' width='546' height='118' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/13sw0223img5X_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5-13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5-13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Let’s say we have the rule <tt>f[a]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> (where <tt>f[a]</tt> is a literal expression).

But typical strategies for automated theorem proving don’t naturally produce such graphs. In principle automated theorem proving could work by directly searching for a “path” that leads to the theorem one’s trying to prove. But usually it’s much easier instead to have as the “target” a simple tautology.</p>\n<p>At least conceptually automated theorem proving must still try to “navigate” through the full token-event graph that makes up the entailment cone. And the main issue in doing this is that there are many places where one does not know “which branch to take”. But here there’s a crucial—if at first surprising—fact: at least so long as one is using full bisubstitution it ultimately doesn’t matter which branch one takes; there’ll always be a way to “merge back” to any other branch.</p>\n<p>This is a consequence of the fact that the accumulative systems we’re using automatically have the property of confluence which says that every branch is accompanied by a subsequent merge. There’s an almost trivial way in which this is true by virtue of the fact that for every edge the system also includes the reverse of that edge. But there’s a more substantial reason as well: that given any two statements on two different branches, there’s always a way to combine them using a bisubstitution to get a single statement.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal invariance</a>—which effectively generalizes confluence—is an important one, that leads among other things to ideas like relativistic invariance. Later on we’ll discuss the idea that “regardless of what order you prove theorems in, you’ll always get the same math”, and its relationship to causal invariance and to the notion of relativity in metamathematics. But for now the importance of confluence is that it has the potential to simplify automated theorem proving—because in effect it says one can never ultimately “make a wrong turn” in getting to a particular theorem, or, alternatively, that if one keeps going long enough every path one might take will eventually be able to reach every theorem. </p>\n<p>And indeed this is exactly how things work in the full entailment cone. But the challenge in automated theorem proving is to generate only a tiny part of the entailment cone, yet still “get to” the theorem we want. And in doing this we have to carefully choose which “branches” we should try to merge using bisubstitution events. In automated theorem proving these bisubstitution events are typically called “critical pair lemmas”, and there are a variety of strategies for defining an order in which critical pair lemmas should be tried. </p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that there’s absolutely no guarantee that such procedures will find the shortest proof of any given theorem (or in fact that they’ll find a proof at all with a given amount of computational effort). One can imagine “higher-order proofs” in which one attempts to transform not just statements of the form <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/15sw0224img24A.png\" width= '64' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, but full proofs (say represented as token-event graphs). And one can imagine <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04057.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>using such transformations to try to simplify proofs</a>. </p>\n<p>A general feature of the proofs we’ve been showing is that they are accumulative, in the sense they continually introduce lemmas which are then reused. But in principle any proof can be “unrolled” into one that just repeatedly uses the original axioms (and in fact, purely by substitution)—and never introduces other lemmas. The necessary “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--proof-structures/'>cut elimination</a>” can effectively be done by always recreating each lemma from the axioms whenever it’s needed—a process which can become exponentially complex.</p>\n<p>As an example, from the axiom above we can generate the proof</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/15sw0224img25A.png\" alt='' title='' width='484' height='464' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/15sw0224img25_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='25-15_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='25-15_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>where for example the first lemma at the top is reused in four events.

Yes, it can provide incontrovertible evidence that a theorem is valid. But that evidence is typically far away from being any kind of “narrative” suitable for human consumption. In the analogy to molecular dynamics, an automated proof gives detailed “turn-by-turn instructions” that show how a molecule can reach a certain place in a gas. Typical “human-style” mathematics, on the other hand, operates on a higher level, analogous to talking about overall motion in a fluid. And a core part of what&#8217;s achieved by our physicalization of metamathematics is understanding why it&#8217;s possible for mathematical observers like us to perceive mathematics as operating at this higher level.</p>\n<h2 id='axiom-systems-of-present-day-mathematics'><span>15 | </span>Axiom Systems of Present-Day Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The axiom systems we’ve been talking about so far were chosen largely for their axiomatic simplicity.

We can think of an axiom system as defining a collection of abstract constraints. But what can we say about objects that might satisfy those constraints? A model is in effect telling us about these objects. Or, put another way, it’s telling what “things” the axiom system “describes”.

Well, yes. They essentially correspond to (representations of) particular finite groups. The original axioms define constraints to be satisfied by any group. These models now correspond to particular groups with specific finite numbers of elements (and in fact specific representations of these groups). And just like in the Boolean algebra case this interpretation now allows us to start saying what the models are “about”. The first three, for example, correspond to cyclic groups which can be thought of as being “about” addition of integers mod <em>k</em>.</p>\n<p>For axiom systems that haven’t traditionally been studied in mathematics, there typically won’t be any such preexisting identification of what they’re “about”. But we can still think of models as being a way that a mathematical observer can characterize—or summarize—an axiom system. And in a sense we can see the collection of possible finite models for an axiom system as being a kind of “model signature” for the axiom system.</p>\n<p>But let’s now consider what models tell us about “theorems” associated with a given axiom system.

But for the non-valid models, different “patches” in the entailment cone are tagged with different codes. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we’re trying to see if two expressions are equal according to the underlying axiom system. The definitive way to tell this is to find a “proof path” from one expression to the other. But as an “approximation” we can just “evaluate” these two expressions according to a model, and see if the resulting codes are the same. Even if it’s a valid model, though, this can only definitively tell us that two expressions aren’t equal; it can’t confirm that they are. In principle we can refine things by checking in multiple models—particularly ones with more elements. But without essentially pre-checking all possible equalities we can’t in general be sure that this will give us the complete story.</p>\n<p>Of course, generating explicit proofs from the underlying axiom system can also be hard—because in general the proof can be arbitrarily long. And in a sense there is a tradeoff. Given a particular equivalence to check we can either search for a path in the entailment graph, often effectively having to try many possibilities. Or we can “do the work up front” by finding a model or collection of models that we know will correctly tell us whether the equivalence is correct.</p>\n<p>Later we’ll see how these choices relate to how mathematical observers can “parse” the structure of metamathematical space. In effect observers can either explicitly try to trace out “proof paths” formed from sequences of abstract symbolic expressions—or they can “globally predetermine” what expressions “mean” by identifying some overall model. In general there may be many possible choices of models—and what we’ll see is that these different choices are essentially analogous to different choices of reference frames in physics.</p>\n<p>One feature of our discussion of models so far is that we’ve always been talking about making models for axioms, and then applying these models to expressions. But in the accumulative systems we’ve discussed above (and that seem like closer metamodels of actual mathematics), we’re only ever talking about “statements”—with “axioms” just being statements we happen to start with.

Yes, one wants to know that a theorem has a proof (and perhaps the proof will be helpful in understanding the theorem), but the main focus is on theorems and not on proofs. In our effort to “go underneath” mathematics, however, we want to study not only what theorems there are, but also the process by which the theorems are reached. We can view it as an important simplifying assumption of typical mathematical observers that all that matters is theorems—and that different proofs aren’t relevant.

But in the middle it breaks into multiple disconnected components—in effect reflecting the emergence of multiple distinct regions of metamathematical space with something like event horizons temporarily existing between them.</p>\n<p>How should we interpret this? First and foremost, it’s something that reveals that there’s structure “below” the “fluid dynamics” level of mathematics; it’s something that depends on the discrete “axiomatic infrastructure” of metamathematics. And from the point of view of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>, we can think of it as a kind of metamathematical analog of a “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/basic-concepts-of-quantum-mechanics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>quantum effect</a>”.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine different paths in the multiway system to correspond to different possible quantum histories. The observer is in effect spread over multiple paths, which they coarse grain or conflate together. An “observable quantum effect” occurs when there are paths that can be followed by the system, but that are somehow “too far apart” to be immediately coarse-grained together by the observer. </p>\n<p>Put another way, there is “noticeable quantum interference” when the different paths corresponding to different histories that are “simultaneously happening” are “far enough apart” to be distinguished by the observer. “Destructive interference” is presumably associated with paths that are so far apart that to conflate them would effectively require conflating essentially every possible path. (And <a href='#the-notion-of-truth'>our later discussion</a> of the relationship between falsity and the “principle of explosion” then suggests a connection between destructive interference in physics and falsity in mathematics.) </p>\n<p>In essence what determines the extent of “quantum effects” is then our “size” as observers in branchial space relative to the size of features in branchial space such as the “topological holes” we’ve been discussing. In the metamathematical case, the “size” of us as observers is in effect related to our ability (or choice) to distinguish slight differences in axiomatic formulations of things. And what we’re saying here is that when there is nontrivial topology in proof space, there is an intrinsic dynamics in metamathematical entailment that leads to the development of distinctions at some scale—though whether these become “visible” to us as mathematical observers depends on how “strong a metamathematical microscope” we choose to use relative to the scale of the “topological holes”.</p>\n<h2 id='time-timelessness-and-entailment-fabrics'><span>19 | </span>Time, Timelessness and Entailment Fabrics</h2>\n<p>A fundamental feature of our metamodel of mathematics is the idea that a given set of mathematical statements can entail others. But in this picture what does “mathematical progress” look like?</p>\n<p>In analogy with physics one might imagine it would be like the evolution of the universe through time. One would start from some limited set of axioms and then—in a kind of “mathematical Big Bang”—these would lead to a progressively larger entailment cone containing more and more statements of mathematics. And in analogy with physics, one could imagine that the process of following chains of successive entailments in the entailment cone would correspond to the passage of time.</p>\n<p>But realistically this isn’t how most of the actual history of human mathematics has proceeded. Because people—and even their computers—basically never try to extend mathematics by axiomatically deriving all possible valid mathematical statements. Instead, they come up with particular mathematical statements that for one reason or another they think are valid and interesting, then try to prove these.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the proof may be difficult, and may involve a long chain of entailments. Occasionally—especially if automated theorem proving is used—the entailments may approximate a geodesic path all the way from the axioms. But the practical experience of human mathematics tends to be much more about identifying “nearby statements” and then trying to “fit them together” to deduce the statement one’s interested in.</p>\n<p>And in general human mathematics seems to progress not so much through the progressive “time evolution” of an entailment graph as through the assembly of what one might call an “entailment fabric” in which different statements are being knitted together by entailments.</p>\n<p>In physics, the analog of the entailment graph is basically the causal graph which builds up over time to define the content of a light cone (or, more accurately, an entanglement cone). The analog of the entailment fabric is basically the (more-or-less) instantaneous state of space (or, more accurately, branchial space). </p>\n<p>In our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> we typically take our lowest-level structure to be a hypergraph—and informally we often say that this <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>hypergraph “represents the structure of space”</a>. But really we should be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/#causal-balls-vs-geodesic-balls'>deducing the “structure of space”</a> by taking a particular time slice from the “dynamic evolution” represented by the causal graph—and for example we should think of two “atoms of space” as “being connected” in the “instantaneous state of space” if there’s a causal connection between them defined within the slice of the causal graph that occurs within the time slice we’re considering. In other words, the “structure of space” is knitted together by the causal connections represented by the causal graph. (In traditional physics, we might say that space can be “mapped out” by looking at overlaps between lots of little light cones.)</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how this works out in our metamathematical setting, using string rewrites to simplify things.

Yes, this structure can in principle be viewed as part of the branchial graph obtained from a slice of an entailment graph (and technically this will be a useful way to think about it). But a different view—closer to the practice of human mathematics—is that it’s a “fabric” formed by fitting together many different mathematical statements. It’s not something where one’s tracking the overall passage of time, and seeing causal connections between things—as one might in “running a program”. Rather, it’s something where one’s fitting pieces together in order to satisfy <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p210--systems-based-on-constraints/'>constraints—as one might in creating a tiling</a>.</p>\n<p>Underneath everything is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. And entailment cones and entailment fabrics can be thought of just as different samplings or slicings of the ruliad. The ruliad is ultimately the entangled limit of all possible computations. But one can think of it as being built up by starting from all possible rules and initial conditions, then running them for an infinite number of steps. An entailment cone is essentially a “slice” of this structure where one’s looking at the “time evolution” from a particular rule and initial condition. An entailment fabric is an “orthogonal” slice, looking “at a particular time” across different rules and initial conditions. (And, by the way, rules and initial conditions are essentially equivalent, particularly in an accumulative system.)</p>\n<p>One can think of these different slices of the ruliad as being what different kinds of observers will perceive within the ruliad. Entailment cones are essentially what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers who persist through time</a> but are localized in rulial space will perceive. Entailment fabrics are what observers who ignore time but explore more of rulial space will perceive. </p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>Elsewhere I’ve argued</a> that a crucial part of what makes us perceive the laws of physics we do is that we are observers who consider ourselves to be persistent through time. But now we’re seeing that in the way human mathematics is typically done, the “mathematical observer” will be of a different character. And whereas for a physical observer what’s crucial is causality through time, for a mathematical observer (at least one who’s doing mathematics the way it’s usually done) what seems to be crucial is some kind of consistency or coherence across metamathematical space. </p>\n<p>In physics it’s far from obvious that a persistent observer would be possible. It could be that with all those detailed computationally irreducible processes happening down at the level of atoms of space there might be nothing in the universe that one could consider consistent through time. But the point is that there are certain “coarse-grained” attributes of the behavior that are consistent through time. And it is by concentrating on these that we end up describing things in terms of the laws of physics we know.</p>\n<p>There’s something very analogous going on in mathematics. The detailed branchial structure of metamathematical space is complicated, and presumably full of computational irreducibility. But once again there are “coarse-grained” attributes that have a certain consistency and coherence across it. And it is on these that we concentrate as human “mathematical observers”. And it is in terms of these that we end up being able to do “human-level mathematics”—in effect operating at a “fluid dynamics” level rather than a “molecular dynamics” one. </p>\n<p>The possibility of “doing physics in the ruliad” depends crucially on the fact that as physical observers we assume that we have certain persistence and coherence through time. The possibility of “doing mathematics (the way it’s usually done) in the ruliad” depends crucially on the fact that as “mathematical observers” we assume that the mathematical statements we consider will have a certain coherence and consistency—or, in effect, that it’s possible for us to maintain and grow a coherent body of mathematical knowledge, even as we try to include all sorts of new mathematical statements. </p>\n<h2 id='the-notion-of-truth'><span>20 | </span>The Notion of Truth</h2>\n<p>Logic was originally conceived as a way to characterize human arguments—in which the concept of “truth” has always seemed quite central. And when logic was applied to the foundations of mathematics, “truth” was also usually assumed to be quite central. But the way we’ve modeled mathematics here has been much more about what statements can be derived (or entailed) than about any kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--truth-and-falsity-in-formal-systems/'>abstract notion of what statements can be “tagged as true”</a>. In other words, we’ve been more concerned with “structurally deriving” that “<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img1A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>” than in saying that “1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is true”.</p>\n<p>But what is the relation between this kind of “constructive derivation” and the logical notion of truth? We might just say that “if we can construct a statement then we should consider it true”. And if we’re starting from axioms, then in a sense we’ll never have an “absolute notion of truth”—because whatever we derive is only “as true as the axioms we started from”. </p>\n<p>One issue that can come up is that our axioms might be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p781--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>inconsistent</a>—in the sense that from them we can derive two obviously inconsistent statements. But to get further in discussing things like this we really need not only to have a notion of truth, but also a notion of falsity.</p>\n<p>In traditional logic it has tended to be assumed that truth and falsity are very much “the same kind of thing”—like 1 and 0. But one feature of our view of mathematics here is that actually truth and falsity seem to have a rather different character. And perhaps this is not surprising—because in a sense if there’s one true statement about something there are typically an infinite number of false statements about it. So, for example, the single statement <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img3A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is true, but the infinite collection of statements <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img4A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> for any other <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img5A.png\" width= '9' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> are all false. </p>\n<p>There is another aspect to this, discussed since at least the Middle Ages, often under the name of the “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion' target=_blank rel=noopener>principle of explosion</a>”: that as soon as one assumes any statement that is false, one can logically derive absolutely any statement at all. In other words, introducing a single “false axiom” will start an explosion that will eventually “blow up everything”.</p>\n<p>So within our model of mathematics we might say that things are “true” if they can be derived, and are “false” if they lead to an “explosion”. But let’s say we’re given some statement. How can we tell if it’s true or false? One thing we can do to find out if it’s true is to construct an entailment cone from our axioms and see if the statement appears anywhere in it. Of course, given computational irreducibility there’s in general no upper bound on how far we’ll need to go to determine this. But now to find out if a statement is false we can imagine introducing the statement as an additional axiom, and then seeing if the entailment cone that’s now produced contains an explosion—though once again there’ll in general be no upper bound on how far we’ll have to go to guarantee that we have a “genuine explosion” on our hands.</p>\n<p>So is there any alternative procedure? Potentially the answer is yes: we can just try to see if our statement is somehow equivalent to “true” or “false”. But in our model of mathematics where we’re just talking about transformations on symbolic expressions, there’s no immediate built-in notion of “true” and “false”. To talk about these we have to add something. And for example what we can do is to say that “true” is equivalent to what seems like an “obvious tautology” such as <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img6A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, or in our computational notation, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img7A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, while “false” is equivalent to something “obviously explosive”, like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img8A.png\" width= '65' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> (or in our particular setup something more like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img9A.png\" width= '101' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>). </p>\n<p>But even though something like “Can we find a way to reach <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img10A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> from a given statement?” seems like a much more practical question for an actual theorem-proving system than “Can we fish our statement out of a whole entailment cone?”, it runs into many of the same issues—in particular that there’s no upper limit on the length of path that might be needed.</p>\n<p>Soon we’ll return to the question of how all this relates to our interpretation of mathematics as a slice of the ruliad—and to the concept of the entailment fabric perceived by a mathematical observer. But to further set the context for what we’re doing let’s explore how what we’ve discussed so far relates to things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--godels-theorem/'>Gödel’s theorem</a>, and to phenomena like incompleteness. </p>\n<p>From the setup of basic logic we might assume that we could consider any statement to be either true or false. Or, more precisely, we might think that given a particular axiom system, we should be able to determine whether any statement that can be syntactically constructed with the primitives of that axiom system is true or false. We could explore this by asking whether every statement is either derivable or leads to an explosion—or can be proved equivalent to an “obvious tautology” or to an “obvious explosion”. </p>\n<p>But as a simple “approximation” to this, let’s consider a string rewriting system in which we define a “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p780--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>local negation operation</a>”. In particular, let’s assume that given a statement like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img11A.png\" width= '82' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> the “negation” of this statement just exchanges A and B, in this case yielding <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img12A.png\" width= '83' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s ask what statements are generated from a given axiom system. Say we start with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img13A.png\" width= '60' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.

But now let’s “negate” the statements, by exchanging A and B. And if we do this, we’ll see that there’s never a statement where both it and its negation occur. In other words, there’s no obvious inconsistency being generated within this axiom system.</p>\n<p>But if we consider instead the axiom <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img16A.png\" width= '72' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> then this gives:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img17A.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='19' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/22sw0227img17Z_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17-22_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17-22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And since this includes both <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img18A.png\" width= '71' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and its “negation” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img19A.png\" width= '73' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, by our criteria we must consider this axiom system to be inconsistent. </p>\n<p>In addition to inconsistency, we can also ask about incompleteness. For all possible statements, does the axiom system eventually generate either the statement or its negation? Or, in other words, can we always decide from the axiom system whether any given statement is true or false?</p>\n<p>With our simple assumption about negation, questions of inconsistency and incompleteness become at least in principle very simple to explore. Starting from a given axiom system, we generate its entailment cone, then we ask within this cone what fraction of possible statements, say of a given length, occur.</p>\n<p>If the answer is more than 50% we know there’s inconsistency, while if the answer is less than 50% that’s evidence of incompleteness. So what happens with different possible axiom systems?</p>\n<p>Here are some <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>results from <em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>, in each case showing both what amounts to the raw entailment cone (or, in this case, multiway system evolution from “true”), and the number of statements of a given length reached after progressively more steps:</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22-nks-p798-implications-for-mathematics-2A.png' alt='Page 798' title='Page 798' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>\n<p>At some level this is all rather straightforward. But from the pictures above we can already get a sense that there’s a problem. For most axiom systems the fraction of statements reached of a given length changes as we increase the number of steps in the entailment cone. Sometimes it’s straightforward to see what fraction will be achieved even after an infinite number of steps. But often it’s not.</p>\n<p>And in general we’ll run into computational irreducibility—so that in effect the only way to determine whether some particular statement is generated is just to go to ever more steps in the entailment cone and see what happens. In other words, there’s no guaranteed-finite way to decide what the ultimate fraction will be—and thus whether or not any given axiom system is inconsistent, or incomplete, or neither.</p>\n<p>For some axiom systems it may be possible to tell. But for some axiom systems it’s not, in effect because we don’t in general know how far we’ll have to go to determine whether a given statement is true or not. </p>\n<p>A certain amount of additional technical detail is required to reach the standard versions of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. (Note that these theorems were originally stated specifically for the Peano axioms for arithmetic, but the Principle of Computational Equivalence suggests that they’re in some sense much more general, and even ubiquitous.) But the important point here is that given an axiom system there may be statements that either can or cannot be reached—but there’s no upper bound on the length of path that might be needed to reach them even if one can.</p>\n<p>OK, so let’s come back to talking about the notion of truth in the context of the ruliad. We’ve discussed axiom systems that might show inconsistency, or incompleteness—and the difficulty of determining if they do. But the ruliad in a sense contains all possible axiom systems—and generates all possible statements.</p>\n<p>So how then can we ever expect to identify which statements are “true” and which are not? When we talked about particular axiom systems, we said that any statement that is generated can be considered true (at least with respect to that axiom system). But in the ruliad every statement is generated. So what criterion can we use to determine which we should consider “true”?</p>\n<p>The key idea is any computationally bounded observer (like us) can perceive only a tiny slice of the ruliad. And it’s a perfectly meaningful question to ask whether a particular statement occurs within that perceived slice.</p>\n<p>One way of picking a “slice” is just to start from a given axiom system, and develop its entailment cone. And with such a slice, the criterion for the truth of a statement is exactly what we discussed above: does the statement occur in the entailment cone?</p>\n<p>But how do typical “mathematical observers” actually sample the ruliad? As we discussed in the previous section, it seems to be much more by forming an entailment fabric than by developing a whole entailment cone. And in a sense progress in mathematics can be seen as a process of adding pieces to an entailment fabric: pulling in one mathematical statement after another, and checking that they fit into the fabric.</p>\n<p>So what happens if one tries to add a statement that “isn’t true”? The basic answer is that it produces an “explosion” in which the entailment fabric can grow to encompass essentially any statement. From the point of view of underlying rules—or the ruliad—there’s really nothing wrong with this. But the issue is that it’s incompatible with an “observer like us”—or with any realistic idealization of a mathematician. </p>\n<p>Our view of a mathematical observer is essentially an entity that accumulates mathematical statements into an entailment fabric. But we assume that the observer is computationally bounded, so in a sense they can only work with a limited collection of statements. So if there’s an explosion in an entailment fabric that means the fabric will expand beyond what a mathematical observer can coherently handle. Or, put another way, the only kind of entailment fabrics that a mathematical observer can reasonably consider are ones that “contain no explosions”. And in such fabrics, it’s reasonable to take the generation or entailment of a statement as a signal that the statement can be considered true.</p>\n<p>The ruliad is in a sense a unique and absolute thing. And we might have imagined that it would lead us to a unique and absolute definition of truth in mathematics. But what we’ve seen is that that’s not the case. And instead our notion of truth is something based on how we sample the ruliad as mathematical observers. But now we must explore what this means about what mathematics as we perceive it can be like.</p>\n<h2 id='what-can-human-mathematics-be-like'><span>21 | </span>What Can Human Mathematics Be Like?</h2>\n<p>The ruliad in a sense contains all structurally possible mathematics—including all mathematical statements, all axiom systems and everything that follows from them. But mathematics as we humans conceive of it is never the whole ruliad; instead it is always just some tiny part that we as mathematical observers sample.</p>\n<p>We might imagine, however, that this would mean that there is in a sense a complete arbitrariness to our mathematics—because in a sense we could just pick any part of the ruliad we want. Yes, we might want to start from a specific axiom system. But we might imagine that that axiom system could be chosen arbitrarily, with no further constraint. And that the mathematics we study can therefore be thought of as an essentially arbitrary choice, determined by its detailed history, and perhaps by cognitive or other features of humans.</p>\n<p>But there is a crucial additional issue. When we “sample our mathematics” from the ruliad we do it as mathematical observers and ultimately as humans. And it turns out that even very general features of us as mathematical observers turn out to put strong constraints on what we can sample, and how.</p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>When we discussed physics</a>, we said that the central features of observers are their computational boundedness and their assumption of their own persistence through time. In mathematics, observers are again computationally bounded. But now it is not persistence through time that they assume, but rather a certain coherence of accumulated knowledge. </p>\n<p>We can think of a mathematical observer as progressively expanding the entailment fabric that they consider to “represent mathematics”. And the question is what they can add to that entailment fabric while still “remaining coherent” as observers. In the previous section, for example, we argued that if the observer adds a statement that can be considered “logically false” then this will lead to an “explosion” in the entailment fabric. </p>\n<p>Such a statement is certainly present in the ruliad. But if the observer were to add it, then they wouldn’t be able to maintain their coherence—because, whimsically put, their mind would necessarily explode. </p>\n<p>In thinking about axiomatic mathematics it’s been standard to say that any axiom system that’s “reasonable to use” should at least be consistent (even though, yes, for a given axiom system it’s in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--consistency-in-axiom-systems/'>general ultimately undecidable</a> whether this is the case). And certainly consistency is one criterion that we now see is necessary for a “mathematical observer like us”. But one can expect that it’s not the only criterion.</p>\n<p>In other words, although it’s perfectly possible to write down any axiom system, and even start generating its entailment cone, only some axiom systems may be compatible with “mathematical observers like us”. </p>\n<p>And so, for example, something like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-4--continuum-and-cardinality/'>Continuum Hypothesis</a>—which is known to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>independent of the “established axioms” of set theory</a>—may well have the feature that, say, it has to be assumed to be true in order to get a metamathematical structure compatible with mathematical observers like us.</p>\n<p>In the case of physics, we know that the general characteristics of observers lead to certain key perceived features and laws of physics. In statistical mechanics, we’re dealing with “coarse-grained observers” who don’t trace and decode the paths of individual molecules, and therefore perceive the Second Law of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, etc. And in our Physics Project we’re also dealing with coarse-grained observers who don’t track all the details of the atoms of space, but instead perceive space as something coherent and effectively continuous. </p>\n<p>And it seems as if in metamathematics there’s something very similar going on. As we began to discuss in the <a href='#mathematics-and-physics-have-the-same-foundations'>very first section above</a>, mathematical observers tend to “coarse grain” metamathematical space. In operational terms, one way they do this is by talking about something like the Pythagorean theorem without always going down to the detailed level of axioms, and for example saying just how real numbers should be defined. And something related is that they tend to concentrate more on mathematical statements and theorems than on their proofs. <a href='#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>Later we&#8217;ll see</a> how in the context of the ruliad there’s an even deeper level to which one can go. But the point here is that in actually doing mathematics one tends to operate at the “human scale” of talking about mathematical concepts rather than the “molecular-scale details” of axioms.</p>\n<p>But why does this work? Why is one not continually “dragged down” to the detailed axiomatic level—or below? How come it’s possible to reason at what we described above as the “fluid dynamics” level, without always having to go down to the detailed “molecular dynamics” level?</p>\n<p>The basic claim is that this works for mathematical observers for essentially the same reason as the perception of space works for physical observers. With the “coarse-graining” characteristics of the observer, it’s inevitable that the slice of the ruliad they sample will have the kind of coherence that allows them to operate at a higher level. In other words, mathematics can be done “at a human level” for the same basic reason that we have a “human-level experience” of space in physics.</p>\n<p>The fact that it works this way depends both on necessary features of the ruliad—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>and in general of multicomputation</a>—as well as on characteristics of us as observers. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, there are “corner cases” where what we’ve described starts to break down. In physics, for example, the “human-level experience” of space breaks down near <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>spacetime singularities</a>. And in mathematics, there are cases where for example <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p789--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>undecidability forces one to take a lower-level</a>, more axiomatic and ultimately more metamathematical view. </p>\n<p>But the point is that there are large regions of physical space—and metamathematical space—where these kinds of issues don’t come up, and where our assumptions about physical—and mathematical—observers can be maintained. And this is what ultimately allows us to have the “human-scale” views of physics and mathematics that we do.</p>\n<h2 id='going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'><span>22 | </span>Going below Axiomatic Mathematics</h2>\n<p>In the traditional view of the foundations of mathematics one imagines that axioms—say stated in terms of symbolic expressions—are in some sense the lowest level of mathematics. But thinking in terms of the ruliad suggests that in fact there is a still-lower “ur level”—a kind of analog of machine code in which everything, including axioms, is broken down into ultimate “raw computation”.</p>\n<p>Take an axiom like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img1A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>, or, in more precise computational language:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img2A.png\" alt='' title='' width='140' height='21' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/24sw0228img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2-24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2-24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Compared to everything we’re used to seeing in mathematics this looks simple. But actually it’s already got a lot in it. For example, it assumes the notion of a binary operator, which it’s in effect naming “∘”. And for example it also assumes the notion of variables, and has two distinct pattern variables that are in effect “tagged” with the names <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. </p>\n<p>So how can we define what this axiom ultimately “means”? Somehow we have to go from its essentially textual symbolic representation to a piece of actual computation. And, yes, the particular representation we’ve used here can immediately be interpreted as computation in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. But the ultimate computational concept we’re dealing with is more general than that. And in particular it can exist in any <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>universal computational system</a>.</p>\n<p>Different universal computational systems (say particular languages or CPUs or Turing machines) may have different ways to represent computations. But ultimately any computation can be represented in any of them—with the differences in representation being like different “coordinatizations of computation”.</p>\n<p>And however we represent computations there is one thing we can say for sure: all possible computations are somewhere in the ruliad. Different representations of computations correspond in effect to different coordinatizations of the ruliad. But all computations are ultimately there.</p>\n<p>For our Physics Project it’s been convenient use a “parametrization of computation” that can be thought of as being based on rewriting of hypergraphs. The elements in these hypergraphs are ultimately purely abstract, but we tend to talk about them as “atoms of space” to indicate the beginnings of our interpretation.</p>\n<p><a name='expression-rewriting'></a>It’s perfectly possible to use hypergraph rewriting as the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/equivalence-and-computation-in-our-models/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“substrate” for representing axiom systems stated in terms of symbolic expressions</a>. But it’s a bit more convenient (though ultimately equivalent) to instead use systems based on expression rewriting—or in effect tree rewriting.</p>\n<p>At the outset, one might imagine that different axiom systems would somehow have to be represented by “different rules” in the ruliad. But as one might expect from the phenomenon of universal computation, it’s actually perfectly possible to think of different axiom systems as just being specified by different “data” operated on by a single set of rules. There are many rules and structures that we could use. But one set that has the benefit of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/'>century of history</a> are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>S, K combinators</a>.</p>\n<p>The basic concept is to represent everything in terms of “combinator expressions” containing just the two objects S and K. (It’s also possible to have just one fundamental object, and indeed <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/06/1920-2020-and-a-20000-prize-announcing-the-s-combinator-challenge/'>S alone may be enough</a>.)</p>\n<p>It’s worth saying at the outset that when we go this “far down” things get pretty non-human and obscure. Setting things up in terms of axioms may already seem pedantic and low level. But going to a substrate below axioms—that we can think of as getting us to raw “atoms of existence”—will lead us to a whole other level of obscurity and complexity.

Basically what we’re seeing is that in the “raw machine code” of S, K combinators it’s possible to “find” a representation for something we consider to be a piece of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Earlier we talked about starting from structures like axiom systems and then “compiling them down” to raw machine code. But what about just “finding mathematics” in a sense “naturally occurring” in “raw machine code”? We can think of the ruliad as containing “all possible machine code”. And somewhere in that machine code must be all the conceivable “structures of mathematics”. But the question is: in the wildness of the raw ruliad, what structures can we as mathematical observers successfully pick out? </p>\n<p>The situation is quite directly analogous to what happens at multiple levels in physics. Consider for example a fluid full of molecules bouncing around. As we’ve discussed several times, observers like us usually aren’t sensitive to the detailed dynamics of the molecules. But we can still successfully pick out large-scale structures—like overall fluid motions, vortices, etc. And—much like in mathematics—we can talk about physics just at this higher level. </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project all this becomes much more extreme. For example, we imagine that space and everything in it is just a giant network of atoms of space. And now within this network we imagine that there are “repeated patterns”—that correspond to things like electrons and quarks and black holes. </p>\n<p>In a sense it is the big achievement of natural science to have managed to find these regularities so that we can describe things in terms of them, without always having to go down to the level of atoms of space. But the fact that these are the kinds of regularities we have found is also a statement about us as physical observers.</p>\n<p>And the point is that even at the level of the raw ruliad our characteristics as physical observers will inevitably lead us to such regularities. The fact that we are computationally bounded and assume ourselves to have a certain persistence will lead us to consider things that are localized and persistent—that in physics we <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/elementary-particles/' target=_blank rel=noopener>identify for example as particles</a>.</p>\n<p>And it’s very much the same thing in mathematics. As mathematical observers we’re interested in picking out from the raw ruliad “repeated patterns” that are somehow robust. But now instead of identifying them as particles, we’ll identify them as mathematical constructs and definitions. In other words, just as a repeated pattern in the ruliad might in physics be interpreted as an electron, in mathematics a repeated pattern in the ruliad might be interpreted as an integer. </p>\n<p>We might think of physics as something “emergent” from the structure of the ruliad, and now we’re thinking of mathematics the same way. And of course not only is the “underlying stuff” of the ruliad the same in both cases, but also in both cases it’s “observers like us” that are sampling and perceiving things.</p>\n<p>There are lots of analogies to the process we’re describing of “fishing constructs out of the raw ruliad”. As one example, consider the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p229--the-emergence-of-order/'>evolution of a (“class 4”) cellular automaton</a> in which <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p292--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>localized structures</a> emerge:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img26A.png\" alt='' title='' width='579' height='356' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/24sw0228img26_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='26-24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='26-24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Underneath, just as throughout the ruliad, there’s lots of detailed computation going on, with rules repeatedly getting applied to each cell. But out of all this underlying computation we can identify a certain set of persistent structures—which we can use to make a “higher-level description” that may capture the aspects of the behavior that we care about. </p>\n<p>Given an “ocean” of S, K combinator expressions, how might we set about “finding mathematics” in them? One straightforward approach is just to identify certain “mathematical properties” we want, and then go searching for S, K combinator expressions that satisfy these.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want to “search for (propositional) logic” we first need to pick combinator expressions to symbolically represent “true” and “false”. There are many pairs of expressions that will work.

Obviously any combinator expression does what it does at the level of raw combinators. But the question is whether it can be given a “higher-level”—and potentially “mathematical”—interpretation.</p>\n<p>And in a sense this is directly an issue of what a mathematical observer “perceives” in it. Does it contain some kind of robust structure—say a kind of analog for mathematics of a particle in physics? </p>\n<p>Axiom systems can be viewed as a particular way to “summarize” certain “raw machine code” in the ruliad. But from the point of a “raw coordinatization of the ruliad” like combinators there doesn’t seem to be anything immediately special about them. At least for us humans, however, they do seem to be an obvious “waypoint”. Because by distinguishing operators and variables, establishing arities for operators and introducing names for things, they reflect the kind of structure that’s familiar from human language.</p>\n<p>But now that we think of the ruliad as what’s “underneath” both mathematics and physics there’s a different path that’s suggested. With the axiomatic approach we’re effectively trying to leverage human language as a way of summarizing what’s going on. But an alternative is to leverage our direct experience of the physical world, and our perception and intuition about things like space. And as we’ll discuss later, this is likely in many ways a better “metamodel” of the way pure mathematics is actually practiced by us humans.</p>\n<p>In some sense, this goes straight from the “raw machine code” of the ruliad to “human-level mathematics”, sidestepping the axiomatic level. But given how much “reductionist” work has already been done in mathematics to represent its results in axiomatic form, there is definitely still great value in seeing how the whole axiomatic setup can be “fished out” of the “raw ruliad”.</p>\n<p>And there’s certainly no lack of complicated technical issues in doing this. As one example, how should one deal with “generated variables”? If one “coordinatizes” the ruliad in terms of something like hypergraph rewriting this is fairly straightforward: it just involves creating new elements or hypergraph nodes (which in physics would be interpreted as atoms of space). But for something like S, K combinators it’s a bit more subtle. In the examples we’ve given above, we have combinators that, when “run”, eventually reach a fixed point. But to deal with generated variables we probably also need combinators <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#combinators-in-the-wild-some-zoology'>that never reach fixed points</a>, making it considerably more complicated to identify correspondences with definite symbolic expressions.</p>\n<p>Another issue involves rules of entailment, or, in effect, the metalogic of an axiom system. In the full axiomatic setup we want to do things like create <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graphs</a>, where each event corresponds to an entailment. But what rule of entailment should be used? The underlying rules for S, K combinators, for example, define a particular choice—though they can be used to emulate others. But the ruliad in a sense contains all choices. And, once again, it’s up to the observer to “fish out” of the raw ruliad a particular “slice”—which captures not only the axiom system but also the rules of entailment used.</p>\n<p>It may be worth mentioning a slightly different existing “reductionist” approach to mathematics: the idea of describing things in terms of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Typed.html'>types</a>. A type is in effect an equivalence class that characterizes, say, all integers, or all functions from tuples of reals to truth values. But in our terms we can interpret a type as a kind of “template” for our underlying “machine code”: we can say that some piece of machine code represents something of a particular type if the machine code matches a particular pattern of some kind. And the issue is then whether that pattern is somehow robust “like a particle” in the raw ruliad.</p>\n<p>An important part of what made our Physics Project possible is the idea of going “underneath” space and time and other traditional concepts of physics. And in a sense what we’re doing here is something very similar, though for mathematics. We want to go “underneath” concepts like functions and variables, and even the very idea of symbolic expressions. In our Physics Project a convenient “parametrization” of what’s “underneath” is a hypergraph made up of elements that we often refer to as “atoms of space”. In mathematics we’ve discussed using combinators as our “parametrization” of what’s “underneath”.</p>\n<p>But what are these “made of”? We can think of them as corresponding to raw elements of metamathematics, or raw elements of computation. But in the end, they’re “made of” whatever the ruliad is “made of”. And perhaps the best description of the elements of the ruliad is that they are “atoms of existence”—the smallest units of anything, from which everything, in mathematics and physics and elsewhere, must be made. </p>\n<p><a name='eme'></a>The atoms of existence aren’t bits or points or anything like that. They’re something fundamentally lower level that’s come into focus only with our Physics Project, and particularly with the identification of the ruliad. And for our purposes here I’ll call such atoms of existence “emes” (pronounced “eemes”, like phonemes etc.). </p>\n<p>Everything in the ruliad is made of emes. The atoms of space in our Physics Project are emes. The nodes in our combinator trees are emes. An eme is a deeply abstract thing. And in a sense all it has is an identity. Every eme is distinct. We could give it a name if we wanted to, but it doesn’t intrinsically have one. And in the end the structure of everything is built up simply from relations between emes. </p>\n<h2 id='the-physicalized-laws-of-mathematics'><span>23 | </span>The Physicalized Laws of Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad suggests there is a deep connection between the foundations of mathematics and physics. And now that we have discussed how some of the familiar formalism of mathematics can “fit into” the ruliad, we are ready to use the “bridge” provided by the ruliad to start exploring how to apply some of the successes and intuitions of physics to mathematics.</p>\n<p>A foundational part of our everyday experience of physics is our perception that we live in continuous space. But our Physics Project implies that at sufficiently small scales <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>space is actually made of discrete elements</a>—and it is only because of the coarse-grained way in which we experience it that we perceive it as continuous.</p>\n<p>In mathematics—unlike physics—we’ve long thought of the foundations as being based on things like symbolic expressions that have a fundamentally discrete structure. Normally, though, the elements of those expressions are, for example, given human-recognizable names (like 2 or <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a></tt>). But what we saw in the previous section is that these recognizable forms can be thought of as existing in an “anonymous” lower-level substrate made of what we can call atoms of existence or emes.</p>\n<p>But the crucial point is that this substrate is directly based on the ruliad. And its structure is identical between the foundations of mathematics and physics. In mathematics the emes aggregate up to give us our universe of mathematical statements. In physics they aggregate up to give us our physical universe.</p>\n<p>But now the commonality of underlying “substrate” makes us realize that we should be able to take our experience of physics, and apply it to mathematics. So what is the analog in mathematics of our perception of the continuity of space in physics? We’ve discussed the idea that we can think of mathematical statements as being laid out in a metamathematical space—or, more specifically, in what we’ve called an <a href='#time-timelessness-and-entailment-fabrics'>entailment fabric</a>. We initially talked about “coordinatizing” this using axioms, but in the previous section we saw how to go “below axioms” to the level of “pure emes”. </p>\n<p>When we do mathematics, though, we’re sampling this on a much higher level. And just like as physical observers we coarse grain the emes (that we usually call “atoms of space”) that make up physical space, so too as “mathematical observers” we coarse grain the emes that make up metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>Foundational approaches to mathematics—particularly over the past century or so—have almost always been based on axioms and on their fundamentally discrete symbolic structure. But by going to a lower level and seeing the correspondence with physics we are led to consider what we might think of as a higher-level “experience” of mathematics—operating not at the “molecular dynamics” level of specific axioms and entailments, but rather at what one might call the “fluid dynamics” level of larger-scale concepts.</p>\n<p>At the outset one might not have any reason to think that this higher-level approach could consistently be applied. But this is the first big place where ideas from physics can be used. If both physics and mathematics are based on the ruliad, and if our general characteristics as observers apply in both physics and mathematics, then we can expect that similar features will emerge. And in particular, we can expect that our everyday perception of physical space as continuous will carry over to mathematics, or, more accurately, to metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>The picture is that we as mathematical observers have a certain <a href='#counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'>“size” in metamathematical space</a>. We identify concepts—like integers or the Pythagorean theorem—as “regions” in the space of possible configurations of emes (and ultimately of slices of the ruliad). At an axiomatic level we might think of ways to capture what a typical mathematician might consider “the same concept” with slightly different formalism (say, different large cardinal axioms or different models of real numbers). But when we get down to the level of emes there’ll be vastly more freedom in how we capture a given concept—so that we’re in effect using a whole region of “emic space” to do so. </p>\n<p>But now the question is what happens if we try to make use of the concept defined by this “region”? Will the “points in the region” behave coherently, or will everything be “shredded”, with different specific representations in terms of emes leading to different conclusions?</p>\n<p>The expectation is that in most cases it will work much like physical space, and that what we as observers perceive will be quite independent of the detailed underlying behavior at the level of emes. Which is why we can expect to do “higher-level mathematics”, without always having to descend to the level of emes, or even axioms.</p>\n<p>And this we can consider as the first great “physicalized law of mathematics”: that coherent higher-level mathematics is possible for us for the same reason that physical space seems coherent to observers like us. </p>\n<p>We’ve discussed several times before the analogy to the Second Law of thermodynamics—and the way it makes possible a higher-level description of things like fluids for “observers like us”. There are certainly cases where the higher-level description breaks down. Some of them may involve specific probes of molecular structure (like Brownian motion). Others may be slightly more “unwitting” (like hypersonic flow). </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we’re very interested in where similar breakdowns might occur—because they’d allow us to “see below” the traditional continuum description of space. Potential targets involve various extreme or singular configurations of spacetime, where in effect the “coherent observer” gets “shredded”, because different atoms of space “within the observer” do different things. </p>\n<p><a name='shredding-of-observers'></a>In mathematics, this kind of “shredding” of the observer will tend to be manifest in the need to “drop below” higher-level mathematical concepts, and go down to a very detailed axiomatic, metamathematical or even eme level—where computational irreducibility and phenomena like undecidability are rampant.</p>\n<p>It’s worth emphasizing that from the point of view of pure axiomatic mathematics it’s not at all obvious that higher-level mathematics should be possible. It could be that there’d be no choice but to work through every axiomatic detail to have any chance of making conclusions in mathematics. </p>\n<p>But the point is that we now know there could be exactly the same issue in physics. Because our Physics Project implies that at the lowest level our universe is effectively made of emes that have all sorts of complicated—and computationally irreducible—behavior. Yet we know that we don’t have to trace through all the details of this to make conclusions about what will happen in the universe—at least at the level we normally perceive it. </p>\n<p>In other words, the fact that we can successfully have a “high-level view” of what happens in physics is something that fundamentally has the same origin as the fact that we can successfully have a high-level view of what happens in mathematics. Both are just features of how observers like us sample the ruliad that underlies both physics and mathematics.</p>\n<h2 id='uniformity-and-motion-in-metamathematical-space'><span>24 | </span>Uniformity and Motion in Metamathematical Space</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed how the basic concept of space as we experience it in physics leads us to our first great physicalized law of mathematics—and how this provides for the very possibility of higher-level mathematics. But this is just the beginning of what we can learn from thinking about the correspondences between physical and metamathematical space implied by their common origin in the structure of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>A key idea is to think of a limit of mathematics in which one is dealing with so many mathematical statements that one can treat them “in bulk”—as forming something we could consider a continuous metamathematical space. But what might this space be like?</p>\n<p>Our experience of physical space is that at our scale and with our means of perception it seems to us for the most part quite simple and uniform. And this is deeply connected to the concept that pure motion is possible in physical space—or, in other words, that it’s possible for things to move around in physical space without fundamentally changing their character.</p>\n<p>Looked at from the point of view of the atoms of space it’s not at all obvious that this should be possible. After all, whenever we move we’ll almost inevitably be made up of different atoms of space. But it’s fundamental to our character as observers that the features we end up perceiving are ones that have a certain persistence—so that we can imagine that we, and objects around us, can just “move unchanged”, at least with respect to those aspects of the objects that we perceive. And this is why, for example, we can discuss laws of mechanics without having to “drop down” to the level of the atoms of space.</p>\n<p>So what’s the analog of all this in metamathematical space? At the present stage of our physical universe, we seem to be able to experience physical space as having features like being basically three-dimensional. Metamathematical space probably doesn’t have such familiar mathematical characterizations. But it seems very likely (and we’ll see some evidence of this from <a href='#empirical-metamathematics'>empirical metamathematics below</a>) that at the very least we’ll perceive metamathematical space as having a certain uniformity or homogeneity.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine that we can think of physical space as <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/cosmology-expansion-and-singularities/' target=_blank rel=noopener>beginning “at the Big Bang”</a> with what amounts to some small collection of atoms of space, but then growing to the vast number of atoms in our current universe through the repeated application of particular rules. But with a small set of rules being applied a vast number of times, it seems almost inevitable that some kind of uniformity must result.</p>\n<p>But then the same kind of thing can be expected in metamathematics. In axiomatic mathematics one imagines the mathematical analog of the Big Bang: everything starts from a small collection of axioms, and then expands to a huge number of mathematical statements through repeated application of laws of inference. And from this picture (which gets a bit more elaborate when one considers emes and the full ruliad) one can expect that at least after it’s “developed for a while” metamathematical space, like physical space, will have a certain uniformity.</p>\n<p>The idea that physical space is somehow uniform is something we take very much for granted, not least because that’s our lifelong experience. But the analog of this idea for metamathematical space is something we don’t have immediate everyday intuition about—and that in fact may at first seem surprising or even bizarre. But actually what it implies is something that increasingly rings true from modern experience in pure mathematics. Because by saying that metamathematical space is in a sense uniform, we’re saying that different parts of it somehow seem similar—or in other words that there’s parallelism between what we see in different areas of mathematics, even if they’re not “nearby” in terms of entailments.</p>\n<p>But this is exactly what, for example, the success of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--category-theory/'>category theory</a> implies. Because it shows us that even in completely different areas of mathematics it makes sense to set up the same basic structures of objects, morphisms and so on. As such, though, category theory defines only the barest outlines of mathematical structure. But what our concept of perceived uniformity in metamathematical space suggests is that there should in fact be closer correspondences between different areas of mathematics.</p>\n<p>We can view this as another fundamental “physicalized law of mathematics”: that different areas of mathematics should ultimately have structures that are in some deep sense “perceived the same” by mathematical observers. For several centuries we’ve known there’s a certain correspondence between, for example, geometry and algebra. But it’s been a major achievement of recent mathematics to identify more and more such correspondences or “dualities”. </p>\n<p>Often the existence of these has seemed remarkable, and surprising. But what our view of metamathematics here suggests is that this is actually a general physicalized law of mathematics—and that in the end essentially all different areas of mathematics must share a deep structure, at least in some appropriate “bulk metamathematical limit” when enough statements are considered.</p>\n<p>But it’s one thing to say that two places in metamathematical space are “similar”; it’s another to say that “motion between them” is possible. Once again we can make an analogy with physical space. We’re used to the idea that we can move around in space, maintaining our identity and structure. But this in a sense requires that we can maintain some kind of continuity of existence on our path between two positions.</p>\n<p>In principle it could have been that we would have to be “atomized” at one end, then “reconstituted” at the other end. But our actual experience is that we perceive ourselves to continually exist all the way along the path. In a sense this is just an assumption about how things work that physical observers like us make; but what’s nontrivial is that the underlying structure of the ruliad implies that this will always be consistent.</p>\n<p>And so we expect it will be in metamathematics. Like a physical observer, the way a mathematical observer operates, it’ll be possible to “move” from one area of mathematics to another “at a high level”, without being “atomized” along the way. Or, in other words, that a mathematical observer will be able to make correspondences between different areas of mathematics without having to go down to the level of emes to do so.</p>\n<p>It’s worth realizing that as soon as there’s a way of representing mathematics in computational terms the concept of universal computation (and, more tightly, the Principle of Computational Equivalence) implies that at some level there must always be a way to translate between any two mathematical theories, or any two areas of mathematics. But the question is whether it’s possible to do this in “high-level mathematical terms” or only at the level of the underlying “computational substrate”. And what we’re saying is that there’s a general physicalized law of mathematics that implies that higher-level translation should be possible.</p>\n<p>Thinking about mathematics at a traditional axiomatic level can sometimes obscure this, however. For example, in axiomatic terms we usually think of Peano arithmetic as not being as powerful as ZFC set theory (for example, it lacks <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--universality-of-set-theory/'>transfinite induction</a>)—and so nothing like “dual” to it. But Peano arithmetic can perfectly well support universal computation, so inevitably a “formal emulator” for ZFC set theory can be built in it. But the issue is that to do this essentially requires going down to the “atomic” level and operating not in terms of mathematical constructs but instead directly in terms of “metamathematical” symbolic structure (and, for example, explicitly emulating things like equality predicates).</p>\n<p>But the issue, it seems, is that if we think at the traditional axiomatic level, we’re not dealing with a “mathematical observer like us”. In the analogy we’ve used above, we’re operating at the “molecular dynamics” level, not at the human-scale “fluid dynamics” level. And so we see all sorts of details and issues that ultimately won’t be relevant in typical approaches to actually doing pure mathematics. </p>\n<p>It’s somewhat ironic that our physicalized approach shows this by going below the axiomatic level—to the level of emes and the raw ruliad. But in a sense it’s only at this level that there’s the uniformity and coherence to conveniently construct a general picture that can encompass observers like us.</p>\n<p>Much as with ordinary matter we can say that “everything is made of atoms”, we’re now saying that everything is “made of computation” (and its structure and behavior is ultimately described by the ruliad). But the crucial idea that emerged from our Physics Project—and that is at the core of what I’m calling the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>—is that when we ask what observers perceive there is a whole additional level of inexorable structure. And this is what makes it possible to do both human-scale physics and higher-level mathematics—and for there to be what amounts to “pure motion”, whether in physical or metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>There’s another way to think about this, that we alluded to earlier. A key feature of an observer is to have a coherent identity. In physics, that involves having a consistent thread of experience in time. In mathematics, it involves bringing together a consistent view of “what’s true” in the space of mathematical statements. </p>\n<p>In both cases the observer will in effect involve many separate underlying elements (ultimately, emes). But in order to maintain the observer’s view of having a coherent identity, the observer must somehow conflate all these elements, effectively treating them as “the same”. In physics, this means “coarse-graining” across physical or branchial (or, in fact, rulial) space. In mathematics, this means “coarse-graining” across metamathematical space—or in effect treating different mathematical statements as “the same”.</p>\n<p>In practice, there are several ways this happens. First of all, one tends to be more concerned about mathematical results than their proofs, so two statements that have the same form can be considered the same even if the proofs (or other processes) that generated them are different (and indeed this is something we have routinely done in constructing entailment cones here). But there’s more. One can also imagine that any statements that entail each other can be considered “the same”. </p>\n<p>In a simple case, this means that if <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img1A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img2A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> then one can always assume <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img3A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. But there’s a much more general version of this embodied in the <a href='https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201309/rnoti-p1164.pdf?trk=2013091164&#038;cat=collection' target=_blank rel=noopener>univalence axiom of homotopy type theory</a>—that in our terms can be interpreted as saying that mathematical observers consider equivalent things the same.</p>\n<p>There’s another way that mathematical observers conflate different statements—that’s in many ways more important, but less formal. As we mentioned above, when mathematicians talk, say, about the Pythagorean theorem, they typically think they have a definite concept in mind. But at the axiomatic level—and even more so at the level of emes—there are a huge number of different “metamathematical configurations” that are all “considered the same” by the typical working mathematician, or by our “mathematical observer”. (At the level of axioms, there might be different axiom systems for real numbers; at the level of emes there might be different ways of representing concepts like addition or equality.)</p>\n<p>In a sense we can think of mathematical observers as having a certain <a href='#counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'>“extent” in metamathematical space</a>. And much like human-scale physical observers see only the aggregate effects of huge numbers of atoms of space, so also mathematical observers see only the “aggregate effects” of huge numbers of emes of metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>But now the key question is whether a “whole mathematical observer” can “move in metamathematical space” as a single “rigid” entity, or whether it will inevitably be distorted—or shredded—by the structure of metamathematical space. In the next section we’ll discuss the analog of gravity—and curvature—in metamathematical space. But our physicalized approach tends to suggest that in “most” of metamathematical space, a typical mathematical observer will be able to “move around freely”, implying that there will indeed be paths or “bridges” between different areas of mathematics, that involve only higher-level mathematical constructs, and don’t require dropping down to the level of emes and the raw ruliad.</p>\n<h2 id='gravitational-and-relativistic-effects-in-metamathematics'><span>25 | </span>Gravitational and Relativistic Effects in Metamathematics</h2>\n<p>If metamathematical space is like physical space, does that mean that it has <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-gravity'>analogs of gravity</a>, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#deriving-special-relativity'>relativity</a>? The answer seems to be “yes”—and these provide our next examples of physicalized laws of mathematics. </p>\n<p>In the end, we’re going to be able to talk about at least gravity in a largely “static” way, referring mostly to the “instantaneous state of metamathematics”, captured as an entailment fabric. But in leveraging ideas from physics, it’s important to start off formulating things in terms of the analog of time for metamathematics—which is entailment.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, the entailment cone is the direct analog of the light cone in physics. Starting with some mathematical statement (or, more accurately, some event that transforms it) the forward entailment cone contains all statements (or, more accurately, events) that follow from it. Any possible “instantaneous state of metamathematics” then corresponds to a “transverse slice” through this entailment cone—with the slice in effect being laid out in metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>An individual entailment of one statement by another corresponds to a path in the entailment cone, and this path (or, more accurately for accumulative evolution, subgraph) can be thought of as a proof of one statement given another. And in these terms the shortest proof can be thought of as a geodesic in the entailment cone. (In practical mathematics, it’s very unlikely one will find—or care about—the strictly shortest proof. But even having a “fairly short proof” will be enough to give the general conclusions we’ll discuss here.)</p>\n<p>Given a path in the entailment cone, we can imagine projecting it onto a transverse slice, i.e. onto an entailment fabric. Being able to consistently do this depends on having a certain uniformity in the entailment cone, and in the sequence of “metamathematical hypersurfaces” that are defined by whatever “metamathematical reference frame” we’re using. But assuming, for example, that underlying computational irreducibility successfully generates a kind of “statistical uniformity” that cannot be “decoded” by the observer, we can expect to have meaningful paths—and geodesics—on entailment fabrics.</p>\n<p>But what these geodesics are like then depends on the emergent geometry of entailment fabrics. In physics, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/' target=_blank rel=noopener>limiting geometry</a> of the analog of this for physical space is presumably a fairly simple 3D manifold. For <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-forms-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space, it&#8217;s more complicated</a>, probably for example being “exponential dimensional”. And for metamathematics, the limiting geometry is also undoubtedly more complicated—and almost certainly exponential dimensional. </p>\n<p>We’ve <a href='#uniformity-and-motion-in-metamathematical-space'>argued that we expect</a> metamathematical space to have a certain perceived uniformity. But what will affect this, and therefore potentially modify the local geometry of the space? The basic answer is exactly the same as in our Physics Project. If there’s “more activity” somewhere in an entailment fabric, this will in effect lead to “more local connections”, and thus effective “positive local curvature” in the emergent geometry of the network. Needless to say, exactly what “more activity” means is somewhat subtle, especially given that the fabric in which one is looking for this is itself defining the ambient geometry, measures of “area”, etc.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we make things more precise by associating <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/matter-energy-and-gravitation/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“activity” with energy density</a>, and saying that energy effectively corresponds to the flux of causal edges through spacelike hypersurfaces. So this suggests that we think about an analog of energy in metamathematics: essentially defining it to be the density of update events in the entailment fabric. Or, put another way, energy in metamathematics depends on the “density of proofs” going through a region of metamathematical space, i.e. involving particular “nearby” mathematical statements.</p>\n<p>There are lots of caveats, subtleties and details. But the notion that “activity AKA energy” leads to increasing curvature in an emergent geometry is a general feature of the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> that the ruliad captures. And in fact we expect a quantitative relationship between energy density (or, strictly, energy-momentum) and induced curvature of the “transversal space”—that corresponds exactly to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/the-vacuum-einstein-equations/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Einstein&#8217;s equations in general relativity</a>. It’ll be more difficult to see this in the metamathematical case because metamathematical space is geometrically more complicated—and less familiar—than physical space.</p>\n<p>But even at a qualitative level, it seems very helpful to think in terms of physics and spacetime analogies. The basic phenomenon is that geodesics are deflected by the presence of “energy”, in effect being “attracted to it”. And this is why we can think of regions of higher energy (or energy-momentum/mass)—in physics and in metamathematics—as “generating gravity”, and deflecting geodesics towards them. (Needless to say, in metamathematics, as in physics, the vast majority of overall activity is just devoted to knitting together the structure of space, and when gravity is produced, it’s from slightly increased activity in a particular region.)</p>\n<p>(In our Physics Project, a key result is that the same kind of dependence of “spatial” structure on energy happens not only in physical space, but also in branchial space—where there’s a direct analog of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>general relativity that basically yields the path integral</a> of quantum mechanics.)</p>\n<p>What does this mean in metamathematics? Qualitatively, the implication is that “proofs will tend to go through where there’s a higher density of proofs”. Or, in an analogy, if you want to drive from one place to another, it’ll be more efficient if you can do at least part of your journey on a freeway.</p>\n<p>One question to ask about metamathematical space is whether one can always get from any place to any other. In other words, starting from one area of mathematics, can one somehow derive all others? A key issue here is whether the area one starts from is computation universal. Propositional logic is not, for example. So if one starts from it, one is essentially trapped, and cannot reach other areas.</p>\n<p>But results in mathematical logic have established that most traditional areas of axiomatic mathematics are in fact computation universal (and the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> suggests that this will be ubiquitous). And given computation universality there will at least be some “proof path”. (In a sense this is a reflection of the fact that the ruliad is unique, so everything is connected in “the same ruliad”.)</p>\n<p>But a big question is whether the “proof path” is “big enough” to be appropriate for a “mathematical observer like us”. Can we expect to get from one part of metamathematical space to another without the observer being “shredded”? Will we be able to start from any of a whole collection of places in metamathematical space that are considered “indistinguishably nearby” to a mathematical observer and have all of them “move together” to reach our destination? Or will different specific starting points follow quite different paths—preventing us from having a high-level (“fluid dynamics”) description of what’s going on, and instead forcing us to drop down to the “molecular dynamics” level?</p>\n<p>In practical pure mathematics, this tends to be an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>issue of whether there is an “elegant proof using high-level concepts”</a>, or whether one has to drop down to a very detailed level that’s more like low-level computer code, or the output of an automated theorem proving system. And indeed there’s a very visceral sense of “shredding” in cases where one’s confronted with a proof that consists of page after page of “machine-like details”. </p>\n<p>But there’s another point here as well. If one looks at an individual proof path, it can be computationally irreducible to find out where the path goes, and the question of whether it ever reaches a particular destination can be undecidable. But in most of the current practice of pure mathematics, one’s interested in “higher-level conclusions”, that are “visible” to a mathematical observer who doesn’t resolve individual proof paths. </p>\n<p>Later we’ll discuss the dichotomy between explorations of computational systems that routinely run into undecidability—and the typical experience of pure mathematics, where undecidability is rarely encountered in practice. But the basic point is that what a typical mathematical observer sees is at the “fluid dynamics level”, where the potentially circuitous path of some individual molecule is not relevant.</p>\n<p>Of course, by asking specific questions—about metamathematics, or, say, about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p787--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>very specific equations</a>—it’s still perfectly possible to force tracing of individual “low-level” proof paths. But this isn’t what’s typical in current pure mathematical practice. And in a sense we can see this as an extension of our first physicalized law of mathematics: not only is higher-level mathematics possible, but it’s ubiquitously so, with the result that, at least in terms of the questions a mathematical observer would readily formulate, phenomena like undecidability are not generically seen.</p>\n<p>But even though undecidability may not be directly visible to a mathematical observer, its underlying presence is still crucial in coherently “knitting together” metamathematical space. Because without undecidability, we won’t have computation universality and computational irreducibility. But—just like in our Physics Project—computational irreducibility is crucial in producing the low-level apparent randomness that is needed to support any kind of “continuum limit” that allows us to think of large collections of what are ultimately discrete emes as building up some kind of coherent geometrical space. </p>\n<p>And when undecidability is not present, one will typically not end up with anything like this kind of coherent space. An extreme example occurs in rewrite systems that eventually terminate—in the sense that they reach a “fixed-point” (or “normal form”) state where no more transformations can be applied.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, this kind of termination can be <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>interpreted as a spacelike singularity</a> at which “time stops” (as at the center of a non-rotating black hole). But in general decidability is associated with “limits on how far paths can go”—just like the limits on causal paths associated with event horizons in physics.</p>\n<p>There are many details to work out, but the qualitative picture can be developed further. In physics, the singularity theorems imply that in essence the eventual formation of spacetime singularities is inevitable. And there should be a direct analog in our context that implies the eventual formation of “metamathematical singularities”. In qualitative terms, we can expect that the presence of proof density (which is the analog of energy) will “pull in” more proofs until eventually there are so many proofs that one has decidability and a “proof event horizon” is formed.</p>\n<p>In a sense this implies that the long-term future of mathematics is strangely similar to the long-term future of our physical universe. In our physical universe, we expect that while the expansion of space may continue, many parts of the universe will form black holes and essentially be “closed off”. (At least ignoring expansion in branchial space, and quantum effects in general.)</p>\n<p>The analog of this in mathematics is that while there can be continued overall expansion in metamathematical space, more and more parts of it will “burn out” because they’ve become decidable. In other words, as more work and more proofs get done in a particular area, that area will eventually be “finished”—and there will be no more “open-ended” questions associated with it.</p>\n<p>In physics there’s sometimes discussion of white holes, which are imagined to effectively be time-reversed black holes, spewing out all possible material that could be captured in a black hole. In metamathematics, a white hole is like a statement that is false and therefore “leads to an explosion”. The presence of such an object in metamathematical space will in effect cause observers to be shredded—making it inconsistent with the coherent construction of higher-level mathematics. </p>\n<p>We’ve talked at some length about the “gravitational” structure of metamathematical space. But what about seemingly simpler things like special relativity? In physics, there’s a notion of basic, flat spacetime, for which it’s easy to construct families of reference frames, and in which parallel trajectories stay parallel. In metamathematics, the analog is presumably metamathematical space in which “parallel proof geodesics” remain “parallel”—so that in effect one can continue “making progress in mathematics” by just “keeping on doing what you’ve been doing”.</p>\n<p>And somehow relativistic invariance is associated with the idea that there are many ways to do math, but in the end they’re all able to reach the same conclusions. Ultimately this is something one expects as a consequence of fundamental features of the ruliad—and the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/multiway-systems-in-the-space-of-all-possible-rules/#p-474' target=_blank rel=noopener>inevitability of causal invariance</a> in it resulting from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. It’s also something that might seem quite familiar from practical mathematics and, say, from the ability to do derivations using different methods—like from either geometry or algebra—and yet still end up with the same conclusions. </p>\n<p>So if there’s an analog of relativistic invariance, what about analogs of phenomena like time dilation? In our Physics Project <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/motion-and-special-relativity/' target=_blank rel=noopener>time dilation has a rather direct interpretation</a>. To “progress in time” takes a certain amount of computational work. But motion in effect also takes a certain amount of computational work—in essence to continually recreate versions of something in different places. But from the ruliad on up there is ultimately only a certain amount of computational work that can be done—and if computational work is being “used up” on motion, there is less available to devote to progress in time, and so time will effectively run more slowly, leading to the experience of time dilation.</p>\n<p>So what is the metamathematical analog of this? Presumably it’s that when you do derivations in math you can either stay in one area and directly make progress in that area, or you can “base yourself in some other area” and make progress only by continually translating back and forth. But ultimately that translation process will take computational work, and so will slow down your progress—leading to an analog of time dilation. </p>\n<p>In physics, the speed of light defines the maximum amount of motion in space that can occur in a certain amount of time. In metamathematics, the analog is that there’s a maximum “translation distance” in metamathematical space that can be “bridged” with a certain amount of derivation. In physics we’re used to measuring spatial distance in meters—and time in seconds. In metamathematics we don’t yet have familiar units in which to measure, say, distance between mathematical concepts—or, for that matter, “amount of derivation” being done. But with the empirical metamathematics we’ll discuss in the next section we actually have the beginnings of a way to define such things, and to use what’s been achieved in the history of human mathematics to at least imagine “empirically measuring” what we might call “maximum metamathematical speed”.</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that we are only at the very beginning of exploring things like the analogs of relativity in metamathematics. One important piece of formal structure that we haven’t really discussed here is causal dependence, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-graph-of-causal-relationships'>causal graphs</a>. We’ve talked at length about statements entailing other statements. But we haven’t talked about questions like which part of which statement is needed for some event to occur that will entail some other statement. And—while there’s no fundamental difficulty in doing it—we haven’t concerned ourselves with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#causal-graphs-and-the-physicalization-of-combinators'>constructing causal graphs</a> to represent causal relationships and causal dependencies between events. </p>\n<p>When it comes to physical observers, there is a very direct interpretation of causal graphs that relates to what a physical observer can experience. But for mathematical observers—where the notion of time is less central—it’s less clear just what the interpretation of causal graphs should be. But one certainly expects that they will enter in the construction of any general “observer theory” that characterizes “observers like us” across both physics and mathematics. </p>\n<h2 id='empirical-metamathematics'><span>26 | </span>Empirical Metamathematics</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed the overall structure of metamathematical space, and the general kind of sampling that we humans do of it (as “mathematical observers”) when we do mathematics. But what can we learn from the specifics of human mathematics, and the actual mathematical statements that humans have published over the centuries?</p>\n<p>We might imagine that these statements are just ones that—as “accidents of history”—humans have “happened to find interesting”. But there’s definitely more to it—and potentially what’s there is a rich source of “empirical data” relevant to our physicalized laws of mathematics, and to what amounts to their “experimental validation”.</p>\n<p>The situation with “human settlements” in metamathematical space is in a sense rather similar to the situation with human settlements in physical space. If we look at where humans have chosen to live and build cities, we’ll find a bunch of locations in 3D space. The details of where these are depend on history and many factors. But there’s a clear overarching theme, that’s in a sense a direct reflection of underlying physics: all the locations lie on the more-or-less spherical surface of the Earth.</p>\n<p>It’s not so straightforward to see what’s going on in the metamathematical case, not least because any notion of coordinatization seems to be much more complicated for metamathematical space than for physical space. But we can still begin by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>doing “empirical metamathematics”</a> and asking questions about for example what amounts to where in metamathematical space we humans have so far established ourselves.

We <a href='#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>discussed above</a> how constructs like numbers and logic can be obtained from a combinator representation of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>We can view the definition dependency graph above as being an empirical example of how somewhat higher-level definitions can be built up. From a computer science perspective, we can think of it as being like a type hierarchy. From a physics perspective, it’s as if we’re starting from atoms, then building up to molecules and beyond. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out, however, that even the top of the definition hierarchy in something like Metamath is still operating very much at an axiomatic kind of level. In the analogy we&#8217;ve been using, it&#8217;s still for the most part “formulating math at the molecular dynamics level” not at the more human “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>We’ve been talking about “the Pythagorean theorem”. But even on the basis of set theory there are many different possible formulations one can give. In Metamath, for example, there is the <a href='https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pythag.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>pythag version</a> (which is what we’ve been using), and there is also a (somewhat more general) <a href='https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pythi.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>pythi version</a>.

But the framework we’ve built here in a sense blends them both into a rather unexpected synthesis.</p>\n<p>The starting point is the idea that mathematics—like physics—is rooted in the ruliad, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>which is a representation of formal necessity</a>. Actual mathematics as we “experience” it is—like physics—based on the particular sampling we make of the ruliad. But then the crucial point is that very basic characteristics of us as “observers” are sufficient to constrain that experience to be our general mathematics—or our physics.</p>\n<p>At some level we can say that “mathematics is always there”—because every aspect of it is ultimately encoded in the ruliad. But in another sense we can say that the mathematics we have is all “up to us”—because it’s based on how we sample the ruliad. But the point is that that sampling is not somehow “arbitrary”: if we’re talking about mathematics for us humans then it’s us ultimately doing the sampling, and the sampling is inevitably constrained by general features of our nature.</p>\n<p>A major discovery from our Physics Project is that it doesn’t take much in the way of constraints on the observer to deeply constrain the laws of physics they will perceive. And similarly we posit here that for “observers like us” there will inevitably be general (“physicalized”) laws of mathematics, that make mathematics inevitably have the general kinds of characteristics we perceive it to have (such as the possibility of doing mathematics at a high level, without always having to drop down to an “atomic” level).</p>\n<p>Particularly over the past century there’s been the idea that mathematics can be specified in terms of axiom systems, and that these axiom systems can somehow be “invented at will”. But our framework does two things. First, it says that “far below” axiom systems is the raw ruliad, which in a sense represents all possible axiom systems. And second, it says that whatever axiom systems we perceive to be “operating” will be ones that we as observers can pick out from the underlying structure of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>At a formal level we can “invent” an arbitrary axiom system (and it’ll be somewhere in the ruliad), but only certain axiom systems will be ones that describe what we as “mathematical observers” can perceive. In a physics setting we might construct some formal physical theory that talks about detailed patterns in the atoms of space (or molecules in a gas), but the kind of “coarse-grained” observations that we can make won’t capture these. Put another way, observers like us can perceive certain kinds of things, and can describe things in terms of these perceptions. But with the wrong kind of theory—or “axioms”—these descriptions won’t be sufficient—and only an observer who’s “shredded” down to a more “atomic” level will be able to track what’s going on.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of different possible math—and physics—in the ruliad. But observers like us can only “access” a certain type. Some putative alien not like us might access a different type—and might end up with both a different math and a different physics. Deep underneath they—like us—would be talking about the ruliad. But they’d be taking different samples of it, and describing different aspects of it.</p>\n<p>For much of the history of mathematics there was a close alignment between the mathematics that was done and what we perceive in the world. For example, Euclidean geometry—with its whole axiomatic structure—was originally conceived just as an idealization of geometrical things that we observe about the world. But by the late 1800s the idea had emerged that one could create “disembodied” axiomatic systems with no particular grounding in our experience in the world. </p>\n<p>And, yes, there are many possible <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p804--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>disembodied axiom systems that one can set up</a>. And in doing <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a> and generally <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>exploring the computational universe</a> it’s interesting to investigate what they do. But the point is that this is something quite different from mathematics as mathematics is normally conceived. Because in a sense mathematics—like physics—is a “more human” activity that’s based on what “observers like us” make of the raw formal structure that is ultimately embodied in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>When it comes to physics there are, it seems, two crucial features of “observers like us”. First, that we’re computationally bounded. And second, that we have the perception that we’re persistent—and have a definite and continuous thread of experience. At the level of atoms of space, we’re in a sense constantly being “remade”. But we nevertheless perceive it as always being the “same us”.</p>\n<p>This single seemingly simple assumption <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>has far-reaching consequences</a>. For example, it leads us to experience a single thread of time. And from the notion that we maintain a continuity of experience from every successive moment to the next we are inexorably led to the idea of a perceived continuum—not only in time, but also for motion and in space. And when combined with intrinsic features of the ruliad and of multicomputation in general, what comes out in the end is a surprisingly precise description of how we’ll perceive our universe to operate—that seems to correspond exactly with known core laws of physics.</p>\n<p>What does that kind of thinking tell us about mathematics? The basic point is that—since in the end both relate to humans—there is necessarily a close correspondence between physical and mathematical observers. Both are computationally bounded. And the assumption of persistence in time for physical observers becomes for mathematical observers the concept of maintaining coherence as more statements are accumulated. And when combined with intrinsic features of the ruliad and multicomputation this then turns out to imply the kind of physicalized laws of mathematics that we’ve discussed.</p>\n<p>In a formal axiomatic view of mathematics one just imagines that one invents axioms and sees their consequences. But what we’re describing here is a view of mathematics that is ultimately just about the ways that we as mathematical observers sample and experience the ruliad. And if we use axiom systems it has to be as a kind of “intermediate language” that helps us make a slightly higher-level description of some corner of the raw ruliad. But actual “human-level” mathematics—like human-level physics—operates at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Our everyday experience of the physical world gives us the impression that we have a kind of “direct access” to many foundational features of physics, like the existence of space and the phenomenon of motion. But our Physics Project implies that these are not concepts that are in any sense “already there”; they are just things that emerge from the raw ruliad when you “parse” it in the kinds of ways observers like us do. </p>\n<p>In mathematics it’s less obvious (at least to all but perhaps experienced pure mathematicians) that there’s “direct access” to anything. But in our view of mathematics here, it’s ultimately just like physics—and ultimately also rooted in the ruliad, but sampled not by physical observers but by mathematical ones. </p>\n<p>So from this point view there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>just as much that&#8217;s “real” underneath mathematics as there is underneath physics</a>. The mathematics is sampled slightly differently (though very similarly)—but we should not in any sense consider it “fundamentally more abstract”. </p>\n<p>When we think of ourselves as entities within the ruliad, we can build up what we might consider a “fully abstract” description of how we get our “experience” of physics. And we can basically do the same thing for mathematics. So if we take the commonsense point of view that physics fundamentally exists “for real”, we’re <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>forced into the same point of view for mathematics</a>. In other words, if we say that the physical universe exists, so must we also say that in some fundamental sense, mathematics also exists.</p>\n<p>It’s not something we as humans “just make”, but it is something that is made through our particular way of observing the ruliad, that is ultimately defined by our particular characteristics as observers, with our particular core assumptions about the world, our particular kinds of sensory experience, and so on.</p>\n<p>So what can we say in the end about whether mathematics is “invented” or “discovered”? It is neither. Its underpinnings are the ruliad, whose structure is a matter of formal necessity. But its perceived form for us is determined by our intrinsic characteristics as observers. We neither get to “arbitrarily invent” what’s underneath, nor do we get to “arbitrarily discover” what’s already there. The mathematics we see is the result of a combination of formal necessity in the underlying ruliad, and the particular forms of perception that we—as entities like us—have. Putative aliens could have quite different mathematics, but not because the underlying ruliad is any different for them, but because their forms of perception might be different. And it’s the same with physics: even though they “live in the same physical universe” their perception of the laws of physics could be quite different.</p>\n<h2 id='what-axioms-can-there-be-for-human-mathematics'><span>28 | </span>What Axioms Can There Be for Human Mathematics?</h2>\n<p>When they were first developed in antiquity the axioms of Euclidean geometry were presumably intended basically as a kind of “tightening” of our everyday impressions of geometry—that would aid in being able to deduce what was true in geometry. But by the mid-1800s—between non-Euclidean geometry, group theory, Boolean algebra and quaternions—it had become clear that there was a range of abstract axiom systems one could in principle consider. And by the time of Hilbert’s program around 1900 the pure process of deduction was in effect being viewed as an end in itself—and indeed the core of mathematics—with axiom systems being seen as “starter material” pretty much just “determined by convention”.</p>\n<p>In practice even today very few different axiom systems are ever commonly used—and indeed in <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> I was able to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p773--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>list essentially all of them comfortably on a couple of pages</a>. But why these axiom systems and not others? Despite the idea that axiom systems could ultimately be arbitrary, the concept was still that in studying some particular area of mathematics one should basically have an axiom system that would provide a “tight specification” of whatever mathematical object or structure one was trying to talk about. And so, for example, the Peano axioms are what became used for talking about arithmetic-style operations on integers.</p>\n<p>In 1931, however, Gödel’s theorem showed that actually these axioms weren’t strong enough to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p800--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>constrain one to be talking only about integers</a>: there were also other possible models of the axiom system, involving all sorts of exotic “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--non-standard-arithmetic/'>non-standard arithmetic</a>”. (And moreover, there was no finite way to “patch” this issue.) In other words, even though the Peano axioms had been invented—like Euclid’s axioms for geometry—as a way to describe a definite “intuitive” mathematical thing (in this case, integers) their formal axiomatic structure “had a life of its own” that extended (in some sense, infinitely) beyond its original intended purpose.</p>\n<p>Both geometry and arithmetic in a sense had foundations in everyday experience. But for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>set theory dealing with infinite sets</a> there was never an obvious intuitive base rooted in everyday experience. Some extrapolations from finite sets were clear. But in covering infinite sets various axioms (like the Axiom of Choice) were gradually added to capture what seemed like “reasonable” mathematical assertions.</p>\n<p>But one example whose status for a long time wasn’t clear was the Continuum Hypothesis—which asserts that the “next distinct possible cardinality” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img1A.png\" width= '17' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> after the cardinality <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img2A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> of the integers is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img3A.png\" width= '25' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>: the cardinality of real numbers (i.e. of “the continuum”). Was this something that followed from previously accepted axioms of set theory? And if it was added, would it even be consistent with them? In the early 1960s it was established that actually the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of the other axioms.</p>\n<p>With the axiomatic view of the foundations of mathematics that’s been popular for the past century or so it seems as if one could, for example, just choose at will whether to include the Continuum Hypothesis (or its negation) as an axiom in set theory. But with the approach to the foundations of mathematics that we’ve developed here, this is no longer so clear.</p>\n<p>Recall that in our approach, everything is ultimately rooted in the ruliad—with whatever mathematics observers like us “experience” just being the result of the particular sampling we do of the ruliad. And in this picture, axiom systems are a particular representation of fairly low-level features of the sampling we do of the raw ruliad. </p>\n<p>If we could do any kind of sampling we want of the ruliad, then we’d presumably be able to get all possible axiom systems—as intermediate-level “waypoints” representing different kinds of slices of the ruliad. But in fact by our nature we are observers capable of only certain kinds of sampling of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>We could imagine “alien observers” not like us who could for example make whatever choice they want about the Continuum Hypothesis. But given our general characteristics as observers, we may be forced into a particular choice. Operationally, as we’ve discussed above, the wrong choice could, for example, be incompatible with an observer who “maintains coherence” in metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a particular axiom stated in standard symbolic form. “Underneath” this axiom there will typically be at the level of the raw ruliad a huge cloud of possible configurations of emes that can represent the axiom. But an “observer like us” can only deal with a coarse-grained version in which all these different configurations are somehow considered equivalent. And if the entailments from “nearby configurations” remain nearby, then everything will work out, and the observer can maintain a coherent view of what’s going, for example just in terms of symbolic statements about axioms.</p>\n<p>But if instead different entailments of raw configurations of emes lead to very different places, the observer will in effect be “shredded”—and instead of having definite coherent “single-minded” things to say about what happens, they’ll have to separate everything into all the different cases for different configurations of emes. Or, as we’ve said it before, the observer will inevitably end up getting “shredded”—and not be able to come up with definite mathematical conclusions.</p>\n<p>So what specifically can we say about the Continuum Hypothesis? It’s not clear. But conceivably we can start by thinking of <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img4A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> as characterizing the “base cardinality” of the ruliad, while <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img5A.png\" width= '25' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> characterizes the base cardinality of a first-level <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#whats-beyond-the-ruliad?'>hyperruliad</a> that could for example be based on Turing machines with oracles for their halting problems. And it could be that for us to conclude that the Continuum Hypothesis is false, we’d have to somehow be straddling the ruliad and the hyperruliad, which would be inconsistent with us maintaining a coherent view of mathematics. In other words, the Continuum Hypothesis might somehow be equivalent to what we’ve argued before is in a sense the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#is-this-the-only-universe?'>most fundamental “contingent fact”</a>—that just as we live in a particular location in physical space—so also we live in the ruliad and not the hyperruliad. </p>\n<p>We might have thought that whatever we might see—or construct—in mathematics would in effect be “entirely abstract” and independent of anything about physics, or our experience in the physical world. But particularly insofar as we’re thinking about mathematics as done by humans we’re dealing with “mathematical observers” that are “made of the same stuff” as physical observers. And this means that whatever general constraints or features exist for physical observers we can expect these to carry over to mathematical observers—so it’s no coincidence that both physical and mathematical observers have the same core characteristics, of computational boundedness and “assumption of coherence”. </p>\n<p>And what this means is that there’ll be a fundamental correlation between things familiar from our experience in the physical world and what shows up in our mathematics. We might have thought that the fact that Euclid’s original axioms were based on our human perceptions of physical space would be a sign that in some “overall picture” of mathematics they should be considered arbitrary and not in any way central. But the point is that in fact our notions of space are central to our characteristics as observers. And so it’s inevitable that “physical-experience-informed” axioms like those for Euclidean geometry will be what appear in mathematics for “observers like us”. </p>\n<h2 id='counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'><span>29 | </span>Counting the Emes of Mathematics and Physics</h2>\n<p>How does the “size of mathematics” compare to the size of our physical universe? In the past this might have seemed like an absurd question, that tries to compare something abstract and arbitrary with something real and physical. But with the idea that both mathematics and physics as we experience them emerge from our sampling of the ruliad, it begins to seem less absurd.</p>\n<p>At the lowest level the ruliad can be thought of as being made up of atoms of existence that we call emes. As physical observers we interpret these emes as atoms of space, or in effect the ultimate raw material of the physical universe. And as mathematical observers we interpret them as the ultimate elements from which the constructs of mathematics are built. </p>\n<p>As the entangled limit of all possible computations, the whole ruliad is infinite. But we as physical or mathematical observers sample only limited parts of it. And that means we can meaningfully ask questions like how the number of emes in these parts compare—or, in effect, how big is physics as we experience it compared to mathematics.</p>\n<p>In some ways an eme is like a bit. But the concept of emes is that they’re “actual atoms of existence”—from which “actual stuff” like the physical universe and its history are made—rather than just “static informational representations” of it. As soon as we imagine that everything is ultimately computational we are immediately led to start thinking of representing it in terms of bits. But the ruliad is not just a representation. It’s in some way something lower level. It’s the “actual stuff” that everything is made of. And what defines our particular experience of physics or of mathematics is the particular samples we as observers take of what’s in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>So the question is now how many emes there are in those samples. Or, more specifically, how many emes “matter to us” in building up our experience. </p>\n<p>Let’s return to an analogy we’ve used several times before: a gas made of molecules. In the volume of a room there might be <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img1A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> individual molecules, each on average colliding every <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img2A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> seconds. So that means that our “experience of the room” over the course of a minute or so might sample <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img3A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> collisions. Or, in terms closer to our Physics Project, we might say that there are perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img4A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> “collision events” in the causal graph that defines what we experience.</p>\n<p>But these “collision events” aren’t something fundamental; they have what amounts to “internal structure” with many associated parameters about location, time, molecular configuration, etc. </p>\n<p>Our Physics Project, however, suggests that—far below for example our usual notions of space and time—we can in fact have a truly fundamental definition of what’s happening in the universe, ultimately in terms of emes. We don’t yet know the “physical scale” for this—and in the end we presumably need experiments to determine that. But <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/units-and-scales/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rather rickety estimates</a> based on a variety of assumptions suggest that the elementary length might be around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img5A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> meters, with the elementary time being around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img6A.png\" width= '44' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> seconds.</p>\n<p>And with these estimates we might conclude that our “experience of a room for a minute” would involve sampling perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img7A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> update events, that create about this number of atoms of space.</p>\n<p>But it’s immediately clear that this is in a sense a gross underestimate of the total number of emes that we’re sampling. And the reason is that we’re not accounting for quantum mechanics, and for the multiway nature of the evolution of the universe. We’ve so far only considered one “thread of time” at one “position in branchial space”. But in fact there are many threads of time, constantly branching and merging. So how many of these do we experience?</p>\n<p>In effect that depends on our size in branchial space. In physical space “human scale” is of order a meter—or perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img8A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> elementary lengths. But how big is it in branchial space? </p>\n<p>The fact that we’re so large compared to the elementary length is the reason that we consistently experience space as something continuous. And the analog in branchial space is that if we’re big compared to the “elementary branchial distance between branches” then we won’t experience the different individual histories of these branches, but only an aggregate “objective reality” in which we conflate together what happens on all the branches. Or, put another way, being large in branchial space is what makes us experience classical physics rather than quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>Our estimates for branchial space are even more rickety than for physical space. But conceivably there are on the order of <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img9A.png\" width= '36' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> “instantaneous parallel threads of time” in the universe, and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img10A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> encompassed by our instantaneous experience—implying that in our minute-long experience we might sample a total of on the order of close to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img11A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes.</p>\n<p>But even this is a vast underestimate. Yes, it tries to account for our extent in physical space and in branchial space. But then <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>there&#8217;s also rulial space</a>—which in effect is what “fills out” the whole ruliad. So how big are we in that space? In essence that’s like asking how many different possible sequences of rules there are that are consistent with our experience. </p>\n<p>The total conceivable number of sequences associated with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img12A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes is roughly the number of possible hypergraphs with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img13A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> nodes—or around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img14A.png\" width= '78' height='22' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>. But the actual number consistent with our experience is smaller, in particular as reflected by the fact that we attribute specific laws to our universe. But when we say “specific laws” we have to recognize that there is a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#living-in-rulial-space'>finiteness to our efforts at inductive inference</a> which inevitably makes these laws at least somewhat uncertain to us. And in a sense that uncertainty is what represents our “extent in rulial space”. </p>\n<p>But if we want to count the emes that we “absorb” as physical observers, it’s still going to be a huge number. Perhaps the base may be lower—say <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img15A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>—but there’s still a vast exponent, suggesting that if we include our extent in rulial space, we as physical observers may experience numbers of emes like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img16A.png\" width= '70' height='22' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>But let’s say we go beyond our “everyday human-scale experience”. For example, let’s ask about “experiencing” our whole universe. In physical space, the volume of our current universe is about <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img17A.png\" width= '30' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than “human scale” (while human scale is perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img18A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than the “scale of the atoms of space”). In branchial space, conceivably our current universe is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img19A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than “human scale”. But these differences absolutely pale in comparison to the sizes associated with rulial space. </p>\n<p>We might try to go beyond “ordinary human experience” and for example measure things using tools from science and technology. And, yes, we could then think about “experiencing” lengths down to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img20A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> meters, or something close to “single threads” of quantum histories. But in the end, it’s still the rulial size that dominates, and that’s where we can expect most of the vast number of emes that form of our experience of the physical universe to come from.</p>\n<p>OK, so what about mathematics? When we think about what we might call human-scale mathematics, and talk about things like the Pythagorean theorem, how many emes are there “underneath”? “Compiling” our theorem down to typical traditional mathematical axioms, we’ve seen that we’ll routinely end up with expressions containing, say, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img21A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> symbolic elements. But what happens if we go “below that”, compiling these symbolic elements—which might include things like variables and operators—into “pure computational elements” that we can think of as emes? We’ve seen a few examples, say with combinators, that suggest that for the traditional axiomatic structures of mathematics, we might need another factor of maybe roughly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img22A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>These are incredibly rough estimates, but perhaps there’s a hint that there’s “further to go” to get from human-scale for a physical observer down to atoms of space that correspond to emes, than there is to get from human-scale for a mathematical observer down to emes.</p>\n<p>Just like in physics, however, this kind of “static drill-down” isn’t the whole story for mathematics. When we talk about something like the Pythagorean theorem, we’re really referring to a whole cloud of “human-equivalent” points in metamathematical space. The total number of “possible points” is basically the size of the entailment cone that contains something like the Pythagorean theorem. The “height” of the entailment cone is related to typical lengths of proofs—which for current human mathematics might be perhaps hundreds of steps. </p>\n<p>And this would lead to overall sizes of <a href='#empirical-metamathematics'>entailment cones</a> of very roughly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img23A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> theorems. But within this “how big” is the cloud of variants corresponding to particular “human-recognized” theorems? Empirical metamathematics could provide additional data on this question. But if we very roughly imagine that half of every proof is “flexible”, we’d end up with things like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img24A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> variants. So if we asked how many emes correspond to the “experience” of the Pythagorean theorem, it might be, say, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img25A.png\" width= '32' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>. </p>\n<p>To give an analogy of “everyday physical experience” we might consider a mathematician thinking about mathematical concepts, and maybe in effect pondering a few tens of theorems per minute—implying according to our extremely rough and speculative estimates that while typical “specific human-scale physics experience” might involve <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img26A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes, specific human-scale mathematics experience might involve <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img27A.png\" width= '32' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes (a number comparable, for example, to the number of physical atoms in our universe). </p>\n<p>What if instead of considering “everyday mathematical experience” we consider <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>all humanly explored mathematics</a>? On the scales we’re describing, the factors are not large. In the history of human mathematics, only a few million theorems have been published. If we think about all the computations that have been done in the service of mathematics, it’s a somewhat larger factor. I suspect <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica'>Mathematica</a> is the dominant contributor here—and we can estimate that the total number of <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language'>Wolfram Language</a> operations corresponding to “human-level mathematics” done so far is perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img28A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>But just like for physics, all these numbers pale in comparison with those introduced by rulial sizes. We’ve talked essentially about a particular path from emes through specific axioms to theorems. But the ruliad in effect contains all possible axiom systems. And if we start thinking about enumerating these—and effectively “populating all of rulial space”—we’ll end up with exponentially more emes. </p>\n<p>But as with the perceived laws of physics, in mathematics as done by humans it’s actually just a narrow slice of rulial space that we’re sampling. It’s like a generalization of the idea that something like arithmetic as we imagine it can be derived from a whole cloud of possible axiom systems. It’s not just one axiom system; but it’s also not all possible axiom systems. </p>\n<p>One can imagine doing some combination of ruliology and empirical metamathematics to get an estimate of “how broad” human-equivalent axiom systems (and their construction from emes) might be. But the answer seems likely to be much smaller than the kinds of sizes we have been estimating for physics.</p>\n<p>It’s important to emphasize that what we’ve discussed here is extremely rough—and speculative. And indeed I view its main value as being to provide an example of how to imagine thinking through things in the context of the ruliad and the framework around it. But on the basis of what we’ve discussed, we might make the very tentative conclusion that “human-experienced physics” is bigger than “human-experienced mathematics”. Both involve vast numbers of emes. But physics seems to involve a lot more. In a sense—even with all its abstraction—the suspicion is that there’s “less ultimately in mathematics” as far as we’re concerned than there is in physics. Though by any ordinary human standards, mathematics still involves absolutely vast numbers of emes. </p>\n<h2 id='some-historical-and-philosophical-background'><span>30 | </span>Some Historical (and Philosophical) Background</h2>\n<p>The human activity that we now call “mathematics” can presumably trace its origins into prehistory. What might have started as “a single goat”, “a pair of goats”, etc. became a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/how-inevitable-is-the-concept-of-numbers/'>story of abstract numbers</a> that could be indicated purely by things like tally marks. In Babylonian times the practicalities of a city-based society led to all sorts of calculations involving arithmetic and geometry—and basically everything we now call “mathematics” <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p792--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>can ultimately be thought of as a generalization of these ideas</a>.</p>\n<p>The tradition of philosophy that emerged in Greek times saw mathematics as a kind of reasoning. But while much of arithmetic (apart from issues of infinity and infinitesimals) could be thought of in explicit calculational ways, precise geometry immediately required an idealization—specifically the concept of a point having no extent, or equivalently, the continuity of space. And in an effort to reason on top of this idealization, there emerged the idea of defining axioms and making abstract deductions from them.</p>\n<p>But what kind of a thing actually was mathematics? Plato talked about things we sense in the external world, and things we conceptualize in our internal thoughts. But he considered mathematics to be at its core an example of a third kind of thing: something from an abstract world of ideal forms. And with our current thinking, there is an immediate resonance between this concept of ideal forms and the concept of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>But for most of the past two millennia of the actual development of mathematics, questions about what it ultimately was lay in the background. An important step was taken in the late 1600s when Newton and others “mathematicized” mechanics, at first presenting what they did in the form of axioms similar to Euclid’s. Through the 1700s mathematics as a practical field was viewed as some kind of precise idealization of features of the world—though with an increasingly elaborate tower of formal derivations constructed in it. Philosophy, meanwhile, typically viewed mathematics—like logic—mostly as an example of a system in which there was a formal process of derivation with a “necessary” structure not requiring reference to the real world.</p>\n<p>But in the first half of the 1800s there arose several examples of systems where axioms—while inspired by features of the world—ultimately seemed to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--history-of-concept-of-mathematics/'>“just invented” (e.g. group theory, curved space, quaternions, Boolean algebra, &#8230;)</a>. A push towards increasing rigor (especially for calculus and the nature of real numbers) led to more focus on axiomatization and formalization—which was still further emphasized by the appearance of a few non-constructive “purely formal” proofs.</p>\n<p>But if mathematics was to be formalized, what should its underlying primitives be? One obvious choice seemed to be logic, which had originally been developed by Aristotle as a kind of catalog of human arguments, but two thousand years later felt basic and inevitable. And so it was that Frege, followed by Whitehead and Russell, tried to start “constructing mathematics” from “pure logic” (along with set theory). Logic was in a sense a rather low-level “machine code”, and it took hundreds of pages of unreadable (if impressive-looking) “code” for Whitehead and Russell, in their <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2010/11/100-years-since-principia-mathematica/'>1910 <em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>, to get to 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. </p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.org/details/principiamathema01anwh/page/366/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/32-principia-mathematica-1910A.png' alt='Pages 366–367' title='Pages 366–367' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, starting around 1900, Hilbert took a slightly different path, essentially representing everything with what we would now call symbolic expressions, and setting up axioms as relations between these. But what axioms should be used? Hilbert seemed to feel that the core of mathematics lay not in any “external meaning” but in the pure formal structure built up from whatever axioms were used. And he imagined that somehow all the truths of mathematics could be “mechanically derived” from axioms, a bit, as he said in a certain resonance with our current views, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/where-did-combinators-come-from-hunting-the-story-of-moses-schonfinkel/#gottingen,-center-of-the-mathematical-universe'>like the “great calculating machine, Nature”</a> does it for physics. </p>\n<p>Not all mathematicians, however, bought into this “formalist” view of what mathematics is. And in 1931 Gödel managed to prove from inside the formal axiom system traditionally used for arithmetic that this system had a fundamental incompleteness that prevented it from ever having anything to say about certain mathematical statements. But Gödel seems to have maintained a more Platonic belief about mathematics: that even though the axiomatic method falls short, the truths of mathematics are in some sense still “all there”, and it’s potentially possible for the human mind to have “direct access” to them. And while this is not quite the same as our picture of the mathematical observer accessing the ruliad, there’s again some definite resonance here.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so how has mathematics actually conducted itself over the past century? Typically there’s at least lip service paid to the idea that there are “axioms underneath”—usually assumed to be those from set theory. There’s been significant emphasis placed on the idea of formal deduction and proof—but not so much in terms of formally building up from axioms as in terms of giving narrative expositions that help humans understand why some theorem might follow from other things they know.</p>\n<p>There’s been a field of “mathematical logic” concerned with using mathematics-like methods to explore mathematics-like aspects of formal axiomatic systems. But (at least until very recently) there’s been rather little interaction between this and the “mainstream” study of mathematics. And for example phenomena like undecidability that are central to mathematical logic have seemed rather remote from typical pure mathematics—even though many actual long-unsolved problems in mathematics do seem likely to run into it.</p>\n<p>But even if formal axiomatization may have been something of a sideshow for mathematics, its ideas have brought us what is without much doubt the single most important intellectual breakthrough of the twentieth century: the abstract concept of computation. And what’s now become clear is that computation is in some fundamental sense much more general than mathematics.</p>\n<p>At a philosophical level one can view the ruliad as containing all computation. But mathematics (at least as it’s done by humans) is defined by what a “mathematical observer like us” samples and perceives in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>The most common “core workflow” for mathematicians doing pure mathematics is first to imagine what might be true (usually through a process of intuition that feels a bit like making “direct access to the truths of mathematics”)—and then to “work backwards” to try to construct a proof. As a practical matter, though, the vast majority of “mathematics done in the world” doesn’t follow this workflow, and instead just “runs forward”—doing computation. And there’s no reason for at least the innards of that computation to have any “humanized character” to it; it can just involve the raw processes of computation.</p>\n<p>But the traditional pure mathematics workflow in effect depends on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>using “human-level” steps</a>. Or if, as we described earlier, we think of low-level axiomatic operations as being like molecular dynamics, then it involves operating at a “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>A century ago efforts to “globally understand mathematics” centered on trying to find common axiomatic foundations for everything. But as different areas of mathematics were explored (and particularly ones like algebraic topology that cut across existing disciplines) it began to seem as if there might also be “top-down” commonalities in mathematics, in effect directly at the “fluid dynamics” level. And within the last few decades, it’s become increasingly common to use ideas from category theory as a general framework for thinking about mathematics at a high level.</p>\n<p>But there’s also been an effort to progressively build up—as an abstract matter—formal “higher category theory”. A notable feature of this has been the appearance of connections to both geometry and mathematical logic—and for us a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#the-view-from-mathematics'>connection to the ruliad</a> and its features. </p>\n<p>The success of category theory has led in the past decade or so to interest in other high-level structural approaches to mathematics. A notable example is homotopy type theory. The basic concept is to characterize mathematical objects not by using axioms to describe properties they should have, but instead to use “types” to say “what the objects are” (for example, “mapping from reals to integers”). Such type theory has the feature that it tends to look much more “immediately computational” than traditional mathematical structures and notation—as well as making explicit proofs and other metamathematical concepts. And in fact questions about types and their equivalences wind up <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#the-view-from-mathematics'>being very much like</a> the questions we’ve discussed for the multiway systems we’re using as metamodels for mathematics.</p>\n<p>Homotopy type theory can itself be set up as a formal axiomatic system—but with axioms that include what amount to metamathematical statements. A key example is the univalence axiom which essentially states that things that are equivalent can be treated as the same. And now from our point of view here we can see this being essentially a statement of metamathematical coarse graining—and a piece of defining what should be considered “mathematics” on the basis of properties assumed for a mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>When Plato introduced ideal forms and their distinction from the external and internal world the understanding of even the fundamental concept of computation—let alone <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputation</a> and the ruliad—was still more than two millennia in the future. But now our picture is that everything can in a sense be viewed as part of the world of ideal forms that is the ruliad—and that not only mathematics but also physical reality are in effect just manifestations of these ideal forms.</p>\n<p>But a crucial aspect is how we sample the “ideal forms” of the ruliad. And this is where the “contingent facts” about us as human “observers” enter. The formal axiomatic view of mathematics can be viewed as providing one kind of low-level description of the ruliad. But the point is that this description isn’t aligned with what observers like us perceive—or with what we will successfully be able to view as human-level mathematics. </p>\n<p>A century ago there was a movement to take mathematics (as well, as it happens, as other fields) beyond its origins in what amount to human perceptions of the world. But what we now see is that while there is an underlying “world of ideal forms” embodied in the ruliad that has nothing to do with us humans, mathematics as we humans do it must be associated with the particular sampling we make of that underlying structure.</p>\n<p>And it’s not as if we get to pick that sampling “at will”; the sampling we do is the result of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>fundamental features of us as humans</a>. And an important point is that those fundamental features determine our characteristics both as mathematical observers and as physical observers. And this fact leads to a deep connection between our experience of physics and our definition of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Mathematics historically began as a formal idealization of our human perception of the physical world. Along the way, though, it began to think of itself as a more purely abstract pursuit, separated from both human perception and the physical world. But now, with the general idea of computation, and more specifically with the concept of the ruliad, we can in a sense see what the limit of such abstraction would be. And interesting though it is, what we’re now discovering is that it’s not the thing we call mathematics. And instead, what we call mathematics is something that is subtly but deeply determined by general features of human perception—in fact, essentially the same features that also determine our perception of the physical world.</p>\n<p>The intellectual foundations and justification are different now. But in a sense our view of mathematics has come full circle. And we can now see that mathematics is in fact deeply connected to the physical world and our particular perception of it. And we as humans can do what we call mathematics for basically the same reason that we as humans manage to parse the physical world to the point where we can do science about it.</p>\n<h2 id='implications-for-the-future-of-mathematics'><span>31 | </span>Implications for the Future of Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Having talked a bit about historical context let’s now talk about what the things we’ve discussed here mean for the future of mathematics—both in theory and in practice. </p>\n<p>At a theoretical level we’ve characterized the story of mathematics as being the story of a particular way of exploring the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a>. And from this we might think that in some sense the ultimate limit of mathematics would be to just deal with the ruliad as a whole. But observers like us—at least doing mathematics the way we normally do it—simply can’t do that. And in fact, with the limitations we have as mathematical observers we can inevitably sample only tiny slices of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But as we’ve discussed, it is exactly this that leads us to experience the kinds of “general laws of mathematics” that we’ve talked about. And it is from these laws that we get a picture of the “large-scale structure of mathematics”—that turns out to be in many ways similar to the picture of the large-scale structure of our physical universe that we get from physics.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, what corresponds to the coherent structure of physical space is the possibility of doing mathematics in terms of high-level concepts—without always having to drop down to the “atomic” level. Effective uniformity of metamathematical space then leads to the idea of “pure metamathematical motion”, and in effect the possibility of translating at a high level between different areas of mathematics. And what this suggests is that in some sense “all high-level areas of mathematics” should ultimately be connected by “high-level dualities”—some of which have already been seen, but many of which remain to be discovered.</p>\n<p>Thinking about metamathematics in physicalized terms also suggests another phenomenon: essentially an <a href='#gravitational-and-relativistic-effects-in-metamathematics'>analog of gravity for metamathematics</a>. As we discussed earlier, in direct analogy to the way that &#8220;larger densities of activity&#8221; in the spatial hypergraph for physics lead to a deflection in geodesic paths in physical space, so also larger &#8220;entailment density&#8221; in metamathematical space will lead to deflection in geodesic paths in metamathematical space. And when the entailment density gets sufficiently high, it presumably becomes inevitable that these paths will all converge, leading to what one might think of as a &#8220;metamathematical singularity&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the spacetime case, a typical analog would be a place where all geodesics have finite length, or in effect “time stops”. In our view of metamathematics, it corresponds to a situation where “all proofs are finite”—or, in other words, where everything is decidable, and there is no more “fundamental difficulty” left. </p>\n<p>Absent other effects we might imagine that in the physical universe the effects of gravity would eventually lead everything to collapse into black holes. And the analog in metamathematics would be that everything in mathematics would “collapse” into decidable theories. But among the effects not accounted for is continued expansion—or in effect the creation of new physical or metamathematical space, formed in a sense by underlying raw computational processes.</p>\n<p>What will observers like us make of this, though? In statistical mechanics an observer who does coarse graining might perceive the “heat death of the universe”. But at a molecular level there is all sorts of detailed motion that reflects a continued irreducible process of computation. And inevitably there will be an infinite collection of possible “slices of reducibility” to be found in this—just not necessarily ones that align with any of our current capabilities as observers. </p>\n<p>What does this mean for mathematics? Conceivably it might suggest that there’s only so much that can fundamentally be discovered in “high-level mathematics” without in effect “expanding our scope as observers”—or in essence changing our definition of what it is we humans mean by doing mathematics. </p>\n<p>But underneath all this is still raw computation—and the ruliad. And this we know goes on forever, in effect continually generating “irreducible surprises”. But how should we study “raw computation”?</p>\n<p>In essence we want to do unfettered exploration of the computational universe, of the kind I did in <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and that we now call the science of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>. It’s something we can view as more abstract and more fundamental than mathematics—and indeed, as we’ve argued, it’s for example what’s underneath not only mathematics but also physics.</p>\n<p>Ruliology is a rich intellectual activity, important for example as a source of models for many processes in nature and elsewhere. But it’s one where computational irreducibility and undecidability are seen at almost every turn—and it’s not one where we can readily expect “general laws” accessible to observers like us, of the kind we’ve seen in physics, and now see in mathematics.</p>\n<p>We’ve argued that with its foundation in the ruliad mathematics is ultimately based on structures lower level than axiom systems. But given their familiarity from the history of mathematics, it’s convenient to use axiom systems—as we have done here—as a kind of “intermediate-scale metamodel” for mathematics.</p>\n<p>But what is the “workflow” for using axiom systems? One possibility in effect inspired by ruliology is just to systematically construct the entailment cone for an axiom system, progressively generating all possible theorems that the axiom system implies. But while doing this is of great theoretical interest, it typically isn’t something that will in practice reach much in the way of (currently) familiar mathematical results.</p>\n<p>But let’s say one’s thinking about a particular result. A proof of this would correspond to a path within the entailment cone. And the idea of <a href='#relations-to-automated-theorem-proving'>automated theorem proving</a> is to systematically find such a path—which, with a variety of tricks, can usually be done vastly more efficiently than just by enumerating everything in the entailment cone. In practice, though, despite half a century of history, automated theorem proving has seen very little use in mainstream mathematics. Of course it doesn’t help that in typical mathematical work a proof is seen as part of the high-level exposition of ideas—but automated proofs tend to operate at the level of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>“axiomatic machine code”</a> without any connection to human-level narrative.</p>\n<p>But if one doesn’t already know the result one’s trying to prove? Part of the intuition that comes from <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is that there can be “interesting results” that are still simple enough that they can conceivably be found by some kind of explicit search—and then verified by automated theorem proving. But so far as I know, only one significant unexpected result has so far ever been found in this way with automated theorem proving: <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>my 2000 result on the simplest axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>.</p>\n<p>And the fact is that when it comes to using computers for mathematics, the overwhelming fraction of the time they’re used not to construct proofs, but instead to do “forward computations” and “get results” (yes, often with <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a>). Of course, within those forward computations, there are many operations—like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Reduce.html'>Reduce</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SatisfiableQ.html'>SatisfiableQ</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PrimeQ.html'>PrimeQ</a></tt>, etc.—that essentially work by internally finding proofs, but their output is “just results” not “why-it’s-true explanations”. (<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>—as its name suggests—is a case where an actual proof is generated.)</p>\n<p>Whether one’s thinking in terms of axioms and proofs, or just in terms of “getting results”, one’s ultimately always dealing with computation. But the key question is how that computation is “packaged”. Is one dealing with arbitrary, raw, low-level constructs, or with something higher level and more “humanized”?</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, at the lowest level, everything can be represented in terms of the ruliad. But when we do both mathematics and physics what we’re perceiving is not the raw ruliad, but rather just certain high-level features of it. But how should these be represented? Ultimately we need a language that we humans understand, that captures the particular features of the underlying raw computation that we’re interested in.</p>\n<p>From our computational point of view, mathematical notation can be thought of as a rough attempt at this. But the most complete and systematic effort in this direction is the one I’ve worked towards for the past several decades: what’s now the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>full-scale computational language</a> that is the Wolfram Language (and Mathematica).</p>\n<p>Ultimately the Wolfram Language can represent any computation. But the point is to make it easy to represent the computations that people care about: to capture the high-level constructs (whether they’re polynomials, geometrical objects or chemicals) that are part of modern human thinking. </p>\n<p>The <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>process of language design</a> (on which, yes, I’ve spent immense amounts of time) is a curious mixture of art and science, that requires both drilling down to the essence of things, and creatively devising ways to make those things accessible and cognitively convenient for humans. At some level it’s a bit like deciding on words as they might appear in a human language—but it’s something more structured and demanding.</p>\n<p>And it’s our best way of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>representing “high-level” mathematics</a>: mathematics not at the axiomatic (or below) “machine code” level, but instead at the level human mathematicians typically think about it. </p>\n<p>We’ve definitely not “finished the job”, though. Wolfram Language currently has around 7000 built-in primitive constructs, of which at least a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/#HigherMathematicalComputation'>couple of thousand can be considered “primarily mathematical”</a>. But while the language has long contained constructs for <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AlgebraicNumbers.html'>algebraic numbers</a>, <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/RandomProcesses.html'>random walks</a> and <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/GroupTheory.html'>finite groups</a>, it doesn’t (yet) have built-in constructs for algebraic topology or K-theory. In recent years we’ve been <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2016/12/22/the-semantic-representation-of-pure-mathematics/'>slowly adding more kinds of pure-mathematical constructs</a>—but to reach the frontiers of modern human mathematics might require <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>perhaps a thousand more</a>. And to make them useful all of them will have to be carefully and coherently designed.</p>\n<p>The great power of the Wolfram Language comes not only from being able to represent things computationally, but also being able to compute with things, and get results. And it’s one thing to be able to represent some pure mathematical construct—but quite another to be able to broadly compute with it.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language in a sense emphasizes the “forward computation” workflow. Another workflow that’s achieved some popularity in recent years is the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07758' target=_blank rel=noopener>proof assistant</a> one—in which one defines a result and then as a human one tries to fill in the steps to create a proof of it, with the computer verifying that the steps correctly fit together. If the steps are low level then what one has is something like typical automated theorem proving—though now being attempted with human effort rather than being done automatically. </p>\n<p>In principle one can build up to much higher-level “steps” in a modular way. But now the problem is essentially the same as in computational language design: to create primitives that are both precise enough to be immediately handled computationally, and “cognitively convenient” enough to be usefully understood by humans. And realistically once one’s done the design (which, after decades of <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>working on such things, I can say is hard</a>), there’s likely to be much more “leverage” to be had by letting the computer just do computations than by expending human effort (even with computer assistance) to put together proofs.</p>\n<p>One might think that a proof would be important in being sure one’s got the right answer. But as we’ve discussed, that’s a complicated concept when one’s dealing with human-level mathematics. If we go to a full axiomatic level it’s very typical that there will be all sorts of pedantic conditions involved. Do we have the “right answer” if underneath we assume that 1/0=0? Or does this not matter at the “fluid dynamics” level of human mathematics? </p>\n<p>One of the great things about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a> is that—at least if it’s written well—it provides a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/'>clear and succinct specification of things</a>, just like a good “human proof” is supposed to. But computational language has the great advantage that it can be run to create new results—rather than just being used to check something.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that there’s another potential workflow beyond “compute a result” and “find a proof”. It’s “here’s an object or a set of constraints for creating one; now find interesting facts about this”. Type into <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> something like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sin%5E4%28x%29'>sin^4(x)</a> (and, yes, there’s “natural math understanding” needed to translate something like this to precise Wolfram Language). There’s nothing obvious to “compute” here. But instead what Wolfram|Alpha does is to “say interesting things” about this—like what its maximum or its integral over a period is.</p>\n<p>In principle this is a bit like exploring the entailment cone—but with the crucial additional piece of picking out which entailments will be “interesting to humans”. (And implementationally it’s a very deeply constrained exploration.) </p>\n<p>It’s interesting to compare these various workflows with what one can call <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/'>experimental mathematics</a>. Sometimes this term is basically just applied to studying explicit examples of known mathematical results. But the much more powerful concept is to imagine discovering new mathematical results by “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/03/two-hours-of-experimental-mathematics/'>doing experiments</a>”.</p>\n<p>Usually these experiments are not done at the level of axioms, but rather at a considerably higher level (e.g. with things specified using the primitives of Wolfram Language). But the typical pattern is to enumerate a large number of cases and to see what happens—with the most exciting result being the discovery of some unexpected phenomenon, regularity or irregularity. </p>\n<p>This type of approach is in a sense much more general than mathematics: it can be applied to anything computational, or anything described by rules. And indeed it is the core methodology of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>, and what it does to explore the computational universe—and the ruliad.</p>\n<p>One can think of the typical approach in pure mathematics as representing a gradual expansion of the entailment fabric, with humans checking (perhaps with a computer) statements they consider adding. Experimental mathematics effectively strikes out in some “direction” in metamathematical space, potentially jumping far away from the entailment fabric currently within the purview of some mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>And one feature of this—very common in ruliology—is that one may <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p753--undecidability-and-intractability/'>run into undecidability</a>. The “nearby” entailment fabric of the mathematical observer is in a sense “filled in enough” that it doesn’t typically have infinite proof paths of the kind associated with undecidability. But something reached by experimental mathematics has no such guarantee. </p>\n<p>What’s good of course is that experimental mathematics can discover phenomena that are “far away” from existing mathematics. But (like in automated theorem proving) there isn’t necessarily any human-accessible “narrative explanation” (and if there’s undecidability there may be no “finite explanation” at all).</p>\n<p>So how does this all relate to our whole discussion of new ideas about the foundations of mathematics? In the past we might have thought that mathematics must ultimately progress just by working out more and more consequences of particular axioms. But what we’ve argued is that there’s a fundamental infrastructure even far below axiom systems—whose low-level exploration is the subject of ruliology. But the thing we call mathematics is really something higher level. </p>\n<p>Axiom systems are some kind of intermediate modeling layer—a kind of “assembly language” that can be used as a wrapper above the “raw ruliad”. In the end, we’ve argued, the details of this language won’t matter for typical things we call mathematics. But in a sense the situation is very much like in practical computing: we want an “assembly language” that makes it easiest to do the typical high-level things we want. In practical computing that’s often achieved with RISC instruction sets. In mathematics we typically imagine using axiom systems like ZFC. But—as reverse mathematics has tended to indicate—there are probably much more accessible axiom systems that could be used to reach the mathematics we want. (And ultimately even <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC is limited</a> in what it can reach.)</p>\n<p>But if we could find such a “RISC” axiom system for mathematics it has the potential to make practical more extensive exploration of the entailment cone. It’s also conceivable—though not guaranteed—that it could be “designed” to be more readily understood by humans. But in the end actual human-level mathematics will typically operate at a level far above it. </p>\n<p>And now the question is whether the “physicalized general laws of mathematics” that we’ve discussed can be used to make conclusions directly about human-level mathematics. We’ve identified a few features—like the very possibility of high-level mathematics, and the expectation of extensive dualities between mathematical fields. And we know that basic commonalities in structural features can be captured by things like category theory. But the question is what kinds of deeper general features can be found, and used.</p>\n<p>In physics our everyday experience immediately makes us think about “large-scale features” far above the level of atoms of space. In mathematics our typical experience so far has been at a lower level. So now the challenge is to think more globally, more metamathematically and, in effect, more like in physics.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, what we call mathematics is what mathematical observers perceive. So if we ask about the future of mathematics we must also ask about the future of mathematical observers.</p>\n<p>If one looks at the history of physics there was already much to understand just on the basis of what we humans could “observe” with our unaided senses. But gradually as more kinds of detectors became available—from microscopes to telescopes to amplifiers and so on—the domain of the physical observer was expanded, and the perceived laws of physics with it. And today, as the practical computational capability of observers increases, we can expect that we’ll gradually see new kinds of physical laws (say associated with hitherto “it’s just random” molecular motion or other features of systems). </p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, we can see our characteristics as physical observers as being associated with “experiencing” the ruliad from one particular “vantage point” in rulial space (just as we “experience” physical space from one particular vantage point in physical space). Putative “aliens” might experience the ruliad from a different vantage point in rulial space—leading them to have laws of physics utterly incoherent with our own. But as our technology and ways of thinking progress, we can expect that we’ll gradually be able to expand our “presence” in rulial space (just as we do with spacecraft and telescopes in physical space). And so we’ll be able to “experience” different laws of physics.</p>\n<p><a name='paramathematics'></a>We can expect the story to be very similar for mathematics. We have “experienced” mathematics from a certain vantage point in the ruliad. Putative aliens might experience it from another point, and build their own “paramathematics” utterly incoherent with our mathematics. The “natural evolution” of our mathematics corresponds to a gradual expansion in the entailment fabric, and in a sense a gradual spreading in rulial space. Experimental mathematics has the potential to launch a kind of “metamathematical space probe” which can discover quite different mathematics. At first, though, this will tend to be a piece of “raw ruliology”. But, if pursued, it potentially points the way to a kind of “colonization of rulial space” that will gradually expand the domain of the mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>The physicalized general laws of mathematics we’ve discussed here are based on features of current mathematical observers (which in turn are highly based on current physical observers). What these laws would be like with “enhanced” mathematical observers we don’t yet know. </p>\n<p>Mathematics as it is today is a great example of the “humanization of raw computation”. Two other examples are theoretical physics and computational language. And in all cases there is the potential to gradually expand our scope as observers. It’ll no doubt be a mixture of technology and methods along with expanded cognitive frameworks and understanding. We can use ruliology—or experimental mathematics—to “jump out” into the raw ruliad. But most of what we’ll see is “non-humanized” computational irreducibility. </p>\n<p>But perhaps somewhere there’ll be another slice of computational reducibility: a different “island” on which “alien” general laws can be built. But for now we exist on our current “island” of reducibility. And on this island we see the particular kinds of general laws that we’ve discussed. We saw them first in physics. But there <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>we discovered that they could emerge</a> quite generically from a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>lower-level computational structure</a>—and ultimately from the very general structure that we call the ruliad. And now, as we’ve discussed here, we realize that the thing we call mathematics is actually based on exactly the same foundations—with the result that it should show the same kinds of general laws.</p>\n<p>It’s a rather different view of mathematics—and its foundations—than we’ve been able to form before. But the deep connection with physics that we’ve discussed allows us to now have a physicalized view of metamathematics, which informs both what mathematics really is now, and what the future can hold for the remarkable pursuit that we call mathematics. </p>\n<style type='text/css'>\n\t#blog #content .post_content h2#some-personal-history-the-evolution-of-these-ideas {\n    border-top: solid 1px #ccc;\n    padding-top: 35px;\n    margin-top: 25px;\n</style>\n<h2 id='some-personal-history-the-evolution-of-these-ideas'>Some Personal History: The Evolution of These Ideas</h2>\n<p>It’s been a long personal journey to get to the ideas described here—stretching back nearly 45 years. Parts have been quite direct, steadily building over the course of time. But other parts have been surprising—even shocking. And to get to where we are now has required me to rethink some very long-held assumptions, and adopt what I had believed was a rather different way of thinking—even though, ironically, I’ve realized in the end that many aspects of this way of thinking pretty much mirror what I’ve done all along at a practical and technological level.</p>\n<p>Back in the late 1970s as a young theoretical physicist I had discovered the “secret weapon” of using computers to do mathematical calculations. By 1979 I had outgrown existing systems and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>decided to build my own</a>. But what should its foundations be? A key goal was to represent the processes of mathematics in a computational way. I thought about the methods I’d found effective in practice. I studied the history of mathematical logic. And in the end I came up with what seemed to me at the time the most obvious and direct approach: that everything should be based on transformations for symbolic expressions.</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure this was actually a good general approach to computation of all kinds—and the system we released in 1981 was named <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/smp-reference-manual.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>SMP (“Symbolic Manipulation Program”)</a> to reflect this generality. History has indeed borne out the strength of the symbolic expression paradigm—and it’s from that we’ve been able to build the huge tower of technology that is the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>modern Wolfram Language</a>. But all along mathematics has been an important use case—and in effect we’ve now seen four decades of validation that the core idea of transformations on symbolic expressions is a good metamodel of mathematics.</p>\n<p>When <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>Mathematica was first released in 1988</a> we called it “A System for Doing Mathematics by Computer”, where by “doing mathematics” we meant doing computations in mathematics and getting results. People soon did all sorts of experiments on using Mathematica to create and present proofs. But the overwhelming majority of actual usage was for directly computing results—and almost nobody seemed interested in seeing the inner workings, presented as a proof or otherwise. </p>\n<p>But in the 1980s I had <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>started my work on exploring the computational universe of simple programs</a> like cellular automata. And doing this was all about looking at the ongoing behavior of systems—or in effect the (often computationally irreducible) history of computations. And even though I sometimes talked about using my computational methods to do “experimental mathematics”, I don’t think I particularly thought about the actual progress of the computations I was studying as being like mathematical processes or proofs.</p>\n<p>In 1991 I started working on what became <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and in doing so I tried to systematically study possible forms of computational processes—and I was soon led to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p88--sequential-substitution-systems/'>substitution systems</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p102--symbolic-systems/'>symbolic systems</a> which I viewed in their different ways as being minimal idealizations of what would become Wolfram Language, as well as to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway systems</a>. There were some areas to which I was pretty sure the methods of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would apply. Three that I wasn’t sure about were biology, physics and mathematics.</p>\n<p>But by the late 1990s I had worked out quite a bit about the first two, and started looking at mathematics. I knew that Mathematica and what would become Wolfram Language were good representations of “practical mathematics”. But I assumed that to understand the foundations of mathematics I should look at the traditional low-level representation of mathematics: axiom systems. </p>\n<p>And in doing this I was soon able to simplify to multiway systems—with proofs being paths:</p>\n<p><a alt=\"Page 775\" title=\"Page 775\" href=\"https://wolframscience.com/nks/p775--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/\"><img alt=\"Page 775—click to enlarge\" title=\"Page 775\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/nks-775-2xA.png\" style=\"width:100%;max-width: 309px;height:auto;\"></a><a alt=\"Page 777\" title=\"Page 777\" href=\"https://wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/\"><img alt=\"Page 777—click to enlarge\" title=\"Page 777\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/nks-777-2xA.png\" style=\"width:100%;max-width: 311px;height:auto;\"></a></p>\n<p>I had long wondered what the detailed relationships between things like my idea of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> and earlier results in mathematical logic were. And I was pleased at how well many things could be clarified—and explicitly illustrated—by thinking in terms of multiway systems. </p>\n<p>My experience in exploring simple programs in general had led to the conclusion that computational irreducibility and therefore undecidability were quite ubiquitous. So I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p793--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>considered it quite a mystery</a> why undecidability seemed so rare in the mathematics that mathematicians typically did. I suspected that in fact undecidability was lurking close at hand—and I got some evidence of that by doing experimental mathematics. But why weren’t mathematicians running into this more? I came to suspect that it had something to do with the history of mathematics, and with the idea that mathematics had tended to expand its subject matter by asking “How can this be generalized while still having such-and-such a theorem be true?”</p>\n<p>But I also wondered about the particular axiom systems that had historically been used for mathematics. They all fit easily on a couple of pages. But why these and not others? Following my general “ruliological” approach of exploring all possible systems I started just <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p804--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>enumerating possible axiom systems</a>—and soon found out that many of them had rich and complicated implications. </p>\n<p>But where among these possible systems did the axiom systems historically used in mathematics lie? I did searches, and at about the 50,000th axiom was able to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--searching-for-logic-axioms/'>find the simplest axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>. Proving that it was correct gave me my first serious <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p811--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>experience with automated theorem proving</a>.</p>\n<p>But what kind of a thing was the proof? I made some attempt to understand it, but it was clear that it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>wasn&#8217;t something a human could readily understand</a>—and reading it felt a bit like trying to read machine code. I recognized that the problem was in a sense a lack of “human connection points”—for example of intermediate lemmas that (like words in a human language) had a contextualized significance. I wondered about how one could find lemmas that “humans would care about”? And I was surprised to discover that at least for the “named theorems” of Boolean algebra a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p817--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>simple criterion could reproduce them</a>. </p>\n<p>Quite a few years went by. Off and on I thought about two ultimately related issues. One was how to represent the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Trace.html'>execution histories</a> of Wolfram Language programs. And the other was how to represent proofs. In both cases there seemed to be all sorts of detail, and it seemed difficult to have a structure that would capture what would be needed for further computation—or any kind of general understanding.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in 2009, we released <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>. One of its features was that it had <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/pro-features/step-by-step-solutions/'>“step-by-step” math computations</a>. But these weren’t “general proofs”: rather they were narratives synthesized in very specific ways for human readers. Still, a core concept in Wolfram|Alpha—and the Wolfram Language—is the idea of integrating in knowledge about as many things as possible in the world. We’d done this for cities and movies and lattices and animals and much more. And I thought about doing it for mathematical theorems as well.</p>\n<p>We did a <a href='https://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/FinalReport.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>pilot project</a>—on theorems about continued fractions. We trawled through the mathematical literature assessing the difficulty of extending the “natural math understanding” we’d built for Wolfram|Alpha. I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>imagined a workflow</a> which would mix automated theorem generation with theorem search—in which one would define a mathematical scenario, then say “tell me interesting facts about this”. And in 2014 we set about engaging the mathematical community in a <a href='https://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/computable-archive-of-mathematics.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>large-scale curation effort</a> to formalize the theorems of mathematics. But try as we might, only people already involved in math formalization seemed to care; with few exceptions working mathematicians just didn’t seem to consider it relevant to what they did.</p>\n<p>We continued, however, to push slowly forward. We worked with proof assistant developers. We curated various kinds of mathematical structures (like <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/FunctionSpace.html'>function spaces</a>). I had estimated that we’d need more than a thousand new Wolfram Language functions to cover “modern pure mathematics”, but without a clear market we couldn’t motivate the huge design (let alone implementation) effort that would be needed—though, partly in a nod to the intellectual origins of mathematics, we did for example do a project that has succeeded in finally <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/12/plane-geometry/euclids-elements.html'>making Euclid-style geometry computable</a>.</p>\n<p>Then in the latter part of the 2010s a couple more “proof-related” things happened. Back in 2002 we’d started using equational logic automated theorem proving to get results in functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FullSimplify.html'>FullSimplify</a></tt>. But we hadn’t figured out how to present the proofs that were generated. In 2018 we finally introduced <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>—allowing programmatic access to proofs, and making it feasible for me to explore collections of proofs in bulk.</p>\n<p>I had for decades been interested in what I’ve called “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>symbolic discourse language</a>”: the extension of the idea of computational language to “everyday discourse”—and to the kind of thing one might want for example to express in legal contracts. And between this and our involvement in the idea of computational contracts, and things like <a href='https://wolframblockchainlabs.com/'>blockchain technology</a>, I started exploring questions of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>AI ethics</a> and “constitutions”. At this point we’d also started to introduce <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/featureset/machine-learning/'>machine-learning-based functions</a> into the Wolfram Language. And—with my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p810--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>“human incomprehensible” Boolean algebra proof</a> as “empirical data”—I started <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>exploring general questions of explainability</a>, and in effect proof.</p>\n<p>And not long after that came the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>surprise breakthrough of our Physics Project</a>. Extending my ideas from the 1990s about computational foundations for fundamental physics it suddenly became possible finally to understand the underlying origins of the main known laws of physics. And core to this effort—and particularly to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>understanding of quantum mechanics</a>—were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway systems</a>.</p>\n<p>At first we just used the knowledge that multiway systems <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>could also represent axiomatic mathematics</a> and proofs to provide analogies for our thinking about physics (“quantum observers might in effect be doing critical-pair completions”, “causal graphs are like higher categories”, etc.) But then we started wondering whether the phenomenon of the emergence that we’d seen for the familiar laws of physics might also affect mathematics—and whether it could give us something like a “bulk” version of metamathematics.</p>\n<p>I had long studied the transition from discrete “computational” elements to “bulk” behavior, first following my interest in the Second Law of thermodynamics, which stretched <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>all the way back to age 12 in 1972</a>, then following my work on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-4--history-of-cellular-automaton-fluids/'>cellular automaton fluids in the mid-1980s</a>, and now with the emergence of physical space from underlying hypergraphs in our Physics Project. But what might “bulk” metamathematics be like? </p>\n<p>One feature of our Physics Project—in fact shared with thermodynamics—is that certain aspects of its observed behavior depend very little on the details of its components. But what did they depend on? We realized that it all had to do with the observer—and their interaction (according to what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>I&#8217;ve described as the 4th paradigm for science</a>) with the general “multicomputational” processes going on underneath. For physics we had some idea what characteristics an “observer like us” might have (and actually they seemed to be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>closely related to our notion of consciousness</a>). But what might a “mathematical observer” be like?</p>\n<p>In its original framing we talked about our Physics Project as being about “finding the rule for the universe”. But right around the time we launched the project we realized that that wasn’t really the right characterization. And we started talking about <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rulial multiway systems</a> that instead “run every rule”—but in which an observer perceives only some small slice, that in particular can show emergent laws of physics.</p>\n<p>But what is this “run every rule” structure? In the end it’s something very fundamental: the entangled limit of all possible computations—that I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. The ruliad basically depends on nothing: it’s unique and its structure is a matter of formal necessity. So in a sense the ruliad “necessarily exists”—and, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>I argued, so must our universe</a>. </p>\n<p>But we can think of the ruliad not only as the foundation for physics, but also as the foundation for mathematics. And so, I concluded, if we believe that the physical universe exists, then we must <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>conclude—a bit like Plato—that mathematics exists too</a>.</p>\n<p>But how did all this relate to axiom systems and ideas about metamathematics? I had two additional pieces of input from the latter half of 2020. First, following up on a note in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I had done an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>extensive study of the “empirical metamathematics”</a> of the network of the theorems in Euclid, and in a couple of math formalization systems. And second, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of their invention essentially as “primitives for mathematics”, I had done an extensive ruliological and other <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>study of combinators</a>.</p>\n<p>I <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/physics-project-working-sessions'>began to work</a> on this current piece in the fall of 2020, but felt there was something I was missing. Yes, I could study axiom systems using the formalism of our Physics Project. But was this really getting at the essence of mathematics? I had long assumed that axiom systems really were the “raw material” of mathematics—even though I’d long gotten signals they weren’t really a good representation of how serious, aesthetically oriented pure mathematicians thought about things.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we’d always had as a target to reproduce the known laws of physics. But what should the target be in understanding the foundations of mathematics? It always seemed like it had to revolve around axiom systems and processes of proof. And it felt like validation when it became clear that the same concepts of “substitution rules applied to expressions” seemed to span my earliest efforts to make math computational, the underlying structure of our Physics Project, and “metamodels” of axiom systems. </p>\n<p>But somehow the ruliad—and the idea that if physics exists so must math—made me realize that this wasn’t ultimately the right level of description. And that axioms were some kind of intermediate level, between the “raw ruliad”, and the “humanized” level at which pure mathematics is normally done. At first I found this hard to accept; not only had axiom systems dominated thinking about the foundations of mathematics for more than a century, but they also seemed to fit so perfectly into my personal “symbolic rules” paradigm.</p>\n<p>But gradually I got convinced that, yes, I had been wrong all this time—and that axiom systems were in many respects missing the point. The true foundation is the ruliad, and axiom systems are a rather-hard-to-work-with “machine-code-like” description below the inevitable general “physicalized laws of metamathematics” that emerge—and that imply that for observers like us there’s a fundamentally higher-level approach to mathematics. </p>\n<p>At first I thought this was incompatible with my general computational view of things. But then I realized: “No, quite the opposite!” All these years I’ve been building the Wolfram Language precisely to connect “at a human level” with computational processes—and with mathematics. Yes, it can represent and deal with axiom systems. But it’s never felt particularly natural. And it’s because they’re at an awkward level—neither at the level of the raw ruliad and raw computation, nor at the level where we as humans define mathematics.</p>\n<p>But now, I think, we begin to get some clarity on just what this thing we call mathematics really is. What I’ve done here is just a beginning. But between its explicit computational examples and its conceptual arguments I feel it’s pointing the way to a broad and incredibly fertile new understanding that—even though I didn’t see it coming—I’m very excited is now here. </p>\n<h2 id='notes-and-thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Notes &#038; Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>For more than 25 years Elise Cawley has been telling me her thematic (and rather Platonic) view of the foundations of mathematics—and that basing everything on constructed axiom systems is a piece of modernism that misses the point.

Cet outil s&rsquo;appelle CryptBoard et n&rsquo;est plus ni moins qu&rsquo;un presse-papier chiffré permettant de copier-coller de manière sécurisée du texte et des fichiers et de les partager entre différentes machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1736356058\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_1' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_1\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos1' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos1\"></div></div><p>Conçu pour permettre un excellent anonymat, <a href=\"https://cryptboard.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CryptBoard</a> utilise un chiffrement hybride RSA + AES côté client. Ainsi, le client fait une demande d&rsquo;autorisation anonyme au serveur, et obtient un UID aléatoire du serveur puis chaque message est chiffré en AES avec une clé aléatoire de 256 bits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cette clé AES aléatoire est ensuite chiffrée par la clé RSA publique de l&rsquo;utilisateur, et envoyée au serveur. Une fois que le destinataire reçoit le message du serveur, il déchiffre la clé AES avec sa clé privée RSA, puis décode le message codé AES</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les utilisateurs doivent partager leur UID et leur clé publique RSA via un lien ou un QR code pour pouvoir s&rsquo;écrire et se lire, mais la clé privée, elle n&rsquo;est pas partagée avec le serveur ni avec les autres clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"665\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230113-lya.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132179\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230113-lya.webp 665w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230113-lya-260x300.webp 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>De plus, l&rsquo;intégrité de la clé publique et de l&rsquo;UID peut être vérifiée visuellement en inspectant l&rsquo;avatar généré à partir du hachage de la clé publique et de l&rsquo;UID.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1415804783\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Ça parait un peu complexe raconté comme ça (lol) mais cette façon de faire permet de résoudre certaines problématiques liées au partage de fichiers ou de texte entre certaines machines et VM, ou machines contrôlées à distance, sans jamais avoir à rogner sur la sécurité.

Cela implique donc par exemple <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">les data brokers</a> dont j&rsquo;ai déjà parlé sur ce site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer, les data brokers vont récupérer vos informations personnelles (depuis différents services et base de données) et essayer de les croiser pour obtenir une fiche la plus complète possible à votre propos. De l&rsquo;adresse mail, à l&rsquo;adresse physique en passant par vos mots de passe ou vos données bancaires. Cela dans le but de les revendre à prix d&rsquo;or à des démarcheurs ou d&rsquo;autres organismes. Selon le data broker&nbsp;cette recherche&nbsp;va aller de simplement récupérer des informations légales (que vous avez données à divers services/sites) jusqu&rsquo;à l&rsquo;illégalité pure et simple (hack de base de données, etc.). Bref le panel est large et croyez-moi, VOS infos sont chez des dizaines d&rsquo;entre eux (voir mon <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">test personnel d&rsquo;Incogni</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce sont ces revendeurs&nbsp;et ces acheteurs&nbsp;qui sont entrés un peu plus dans le collimateur de la CNIL depuis début de l&rsquo;an dernier. Avec un rappel prononcé de leurs obligations en décembre 2022. Ce qu&rsquo;il faut savoir c&rsquo;est que ce genre de pratique n&rsquo;est PAS interdite par le RGPD, ce n&rsquo;est donc pas aussi simple que de dire qu&rsquo;il faut tous les épingler, il existe une marge de manoeuvre.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"360\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/b96-incognicnil-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La première chose qui leur est demandée est justement de<strong> s&rsquo;assurer de la légalité des données</strong>. Notamment qu&rsquo;elles ont bien été récoltées avec l&rsquo;accord de la personne.&nbsp;Dans la majorité des cas ce sera&nbsp;que la personne a bien validé ou coché la case des conditions générales &amp; Co lorsqu&rsquo;elle s&rsquo;est inscrite ou qu&rsquo;elle a rempli&nbsp;un formulaire. Pour ceux qui refusent ces transmissions de données dès l&rsquo;inscription, cela ne doit bien entendu&nbsp;jamais se retrouver chez un data broker, et encore moins être revendu par ce dernier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le second point c&rsquo;est que <strong>les données ne soient pas conservées plus longtemps que ne le demande la CNIL</strong>. À savoir 3 ans après la fin de l&rsquo;acte qui a généré la relation commerciale (que ce soit l&rsquo;achat sur un site e-commerce, la&nbsp;délivrance d&rsquo;une&nbsp;prestation diverse, la fin d&rsquo;une garantie&nbsp;&#8230;). De plus, tout ce qui a trait à la gestion d&rsquo;un contentieux, à la comptabilité, etc. (bref toute la paperasse administrative) doit être exclu&nbsp;par défaut&nbsp;et ne pas être partagé.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Là où le règlement de la&nbsp;CNIL va plus loin, c&rsquo;est dans le fait que les acquéreurs des données&nbsp;doivent eux aussi s&rsquo;assurer que tout est légal. Et nous en informer (dans un délai d&rsquo;un mois), en citant leur source, si ce n&rsquo;est pas le cas.&nbsp;Nous dire à&nbsp;qui ils ont acheté nos informations en somme et nous demander notre accord. Et ça, c&rsquo;est plutôt cool parce que ça permet de savoir où nos infos ont trainé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"320\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/WmjRRRrcUgb1WXM24M/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ils doivent pouvoir prouver que nous avons donné notre consentement pour tout démarchage. C&rsquo;est parfois inscrit de manière explicite dans les conditions générales ou les formulaires que nous validons en créant un compte quelconque. En vous inscrivant sur WhatsApp, vos données sont partagées avec Facebook &amp; Co. Ce genre de choses. Dans le cas inverse à lui de recueillir votre assentiment. Et si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas d&rsquo;accord, il doit respecter votre demande de retrait/modification de sa liste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, ça, c&rsquo;est la théorie. Pas toujours simple à faire respecter ou difficile à gérer au cas par cas. Comment vraiment savoir qui a quoi ? À qui avez-vous donné les droits de partage sur tel site en 2017 ? Etc. Si vous préférez déléguer ou prendre les devants, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\">il y a Incogni</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme je l&rsquo;ai déjà expliqué dans d&rsquo;autres articles, le job d&rsquo;Incogni va être proactif, avant même que les sociétés aient à vous contacter. Vous lui indiquez les données que vous acceptez de partager et celles que vous ne voulez plus voir sur le web et il va faire le taf à votre place.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"281\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/vN3fMMSAmVwoo/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il commencera par analyser le contenu de ce que possèdent des dizaines de data brokers sur vous. Et ensuite il les contactera pour leur demander de supprimer ce qui ne vous convient pas. De cette manière les acheteurs n&rsquo;auront déjà plus accès à ces informations lorsqu&rsquo;ils vont acquérir une base de données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si les data brokers ne font pas le boulot ? Incogni va continuer à les harceler régulièrement. Et si cela ne suffit toujours pas ? Alors vous pourrez peut-être vous tourner vers la CNIL. Mais, pour&nbsp;5-6€/mois, le service de Surfshark est plutôt pratique. J&rsquo;ai pris quelques minutes pour mettre en place mon test et depuis ce sont des dizaines de brokers qui m&rsquo;ont retiré de leurs listes. Et qui continuerons, car l&rsquo;outil veille au grain pour le cas où ils me réintégreraient en scred.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Testez Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Les visiteurs pourront collecter des&nbsp;NFTs&nbsp;auprès des partenaires de l&rsquo;événement&nbsp;via des QR codes&nbsp;disposés&nbsp;à l&rsquo;entrée et sur leurs stands.&nbsp; Partenaire de la Talent&nbsp;Fair, évènement RH dédié aux développeurs et recruteurs du Web3, Master Dev France offrira à ses visiteurs une expérience unique : la fusion de son NFT avec celui de la « Talent&nbsp;Fair&nbsp;» de&nbsp;la Paris Blockchain Week. Une première mondiale dans le cadre d’un événement professionnel !&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le programme prévoit&nbsp;<strong>une bonne&nbsp;vingtaine de conférences</strong>&nbsp;sur des sujets tech d’actualité, notamment&nbsp;le <strong>Web3</strong>&nbsp;(et l’Internet décentralisé au sens large),&nbsp;&nbsp;l’<strong>Intelligence Artificielle</strong>, les applications quantiques du futur…Du coup ce sera l’occasion d’avoir de bonnes introductions pour ceux qui voudraient en apprendre plus sur le&nbsp;métavers, la blockchain, le hack éthique, la cybersécurité, la régulation dans la crypto,&nbsp;l’éthique autour de l’IA, les algorithmes, l’inclusion numérique etc. En fin de journée, il y aura même un concert gratuit ! Ne mangez pas trop à midi, il faudra être en forme&nbsp;😉</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xPEQktRd4wa15ppQwq/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En parallèle de ces conférences&nbsp;(et c’est ce qui fait battre mon petit cœur un peu plus fort), il y aura <strong>un&nbsp;gros concours pour les développeurs et développeuses</strong>. Le choix des armes sera assez vaste puisque chacun pourra choisir son langage préféré parmi une liste de 15 (PHP, Python, Java, C++ …).&nbsp;2000 participants de toute l’Europe sont attendus pour ce concours de code live qui offrira 3 très beaux challenges algorithmiques et des prix plutôt sympas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus de 30 000€ sont à se répartir entre les meilleurs. Il y aura même une récompense pour celui ou celle qui codera de la manière la plus écoresponsable. 7 sessions qualificatives (sélection des 25 meilleurs de chaque)&nbsp;+ la finale qui&nbsp;formeront une sorte de fil rouge de la journée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous êtes dev et vous voulez participer ? Il est encore temps <strong><a href=\"https://www.masterdevfrance.com/concours/?utm_campaign=MDF&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=influence&amp;utm_content=korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">de vous inscrire via ce formulaire</a></strong>. Et si c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;un d&rsquo;entre vous qui l&#8217;emporte je veux <s>30% des gains</s> un « merci tonton Korben » sur scène lors de la remise du prix :p</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"266\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/h8ZRNWU2CDeA48fCYi/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sur place vous allez pouvoir jongler entre conférences et sessions de code live tout au long de la journée. Ce genre d’évent c’est souvent assez sport pour faire tout ce qui nous intéresse donc pensez à planifier un peu. Tout en sachant que votre planning va tomber à l’eau une fois sur place parce que vous vous serez laissé entrainer par un truc ou l’autre. En tous cas c’est toujours ce qu’il m’arrive&nbsp;😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une autre ambition de Master Dev France est de mettre en lumière la place des femmes dans le milieu du dev et de la tech. Eh oui, notre monde professionnel est encore trop souvent&nbsp;perçu comme un milieu où&nbsp;elles n’ont pas toute la présence qu’elles méritent. Cela se traduit notamment par une équipe 100% féminine pour le concours de code et la présence de nombreuses intervenantes expertes de leurs sujets&nbsp;!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/salon-mdf-2023.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132556\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/salon-mdf-2023.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/salon-mdf-2023-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La journée (qui attend 5000 visiteurs)&nbsp;est organisée par <a href=\"https://www.docaposte.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Docaposte</a>, la filiale numérique de La Poste, experte dans le traitement de la data et des données sensibles en particulier (comme les signatures électroniques, l’hébergement des dossiers médicaux, l’archivage numérique ou tout ce qui touche à l’identité numérique…).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En tous cas&nbsp;ça fait du bien de revoir ce genre de salons et de conférences de manière&nbsp;régulière dans un monde post-pandémie !&nbsp;Des tas de devs et de geeks vont enfin pouvoir retrouver un semblant de vie sociale, quelques jours&nbsp;chaque année&nbsp;😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’évènement se tiendra le jeudi&nbsp;9 mars 2023&nbsp;au Parc des Expositions de Paris,&nbsp;Porte de Versailles – Hall 5.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/3RrFwiX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inscrivez-vous gratuitement au&nbsp;Master Dev France 2023 !</a></h2>\n",

Enfin, il est également compatible avec de nombreux éditeurs/IDE et est utilisé par de nombreux services en ligne tels que HoundCI, Sider et CodeClimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au niveau installation, rien de complexe.

Il est également disponible avec la commande curlconverter que vous pouvez installer sur votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Par exemple, cette commande curl d&rsquo;authentification : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>curl \"https://example.com/\" -u \"some_username:some_password\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Devient en DART le code suivant : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>import 'dart:convert';\nimport 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\n\nvoid main() async {\n  var uname = 'some_username';\n  var pword = 'some_password';\n  var authn = 'Basic ' + base64Encode(utf8.encode('$uname:$pword'));\n\n  var url = Uri.parse('https://example.com/');\n  var res = await http.get(url, headers: {'Authorization': authn});\n  if (res.statusCode != 200) throw Exception('http.get error: statusCode= ${res.statusCode}');\n  print(res.body);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1086223493\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Ou en C# : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\n\nHttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, \"https://example.com/\");\n\nrequest.Headers.Add(\"Authorization\", \"Basic \" + Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(\"some_username:some_password\")));\n\nHttpResponseMessage response = await client.SendAsync(request);\nresponse.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\nstring responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>CurlConverter sait interpréter la syntaxe Bash, tels que les chaînes de caractères ANSI-C et les fichiers pipés. Il connaît également tous les arguments de curl (il y en a plus de 300 !!), y compris ceux qui ont été supprimés des versions récentes (et donc ignorés la plupart du temps). Il peut également convertir les données JSON en objets natifs et génère le code capable de le lire soit à partir d&rsquo;un fichier ou d&rsquo;un flux en entrée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malheureusement, seul le protocole HTTP est pris en charge, et les générateurs de code pour d&rsquo;autres langages sont moins complets que le générateur pour Python. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour utiliser <a href=\"https://curlconverter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">curlconverter</a>, vous pouvez l&rsquo;installer en tant que bibliothèque JavaScript avec la commande </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>npm install curlconverter</code></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou comme outil utilisable en ligne de commande comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>npm install --global curlconverter</code></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici un exemple de code généré à partir de cette commande :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ curlconverter --data \"hello=world\" example.com\nimport requests\n\ndata = {\n    'hello': 'world',\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post('http://example.com', data=data)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1758613486\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Bref, super pratique pour ceux qui veulent se simplifier le processus de création de requêtes HTTP dans leur langage favori, tout en se reposant sur des commandes curl plus familières.</p>\n",

Et c&rsquo;est dommage car en tant que développeur, vous aimeriez peut être mesurer le temps d&rsquo;exécution d&rsquo;un script shell pour savoir s&rsquo;il est plus rapide qu&rsquo;une version précédente. Ou pouvoir comparer la rapidité d&rsquo;exécution de différents programmes afin de sélectionner le meilleur !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pas de souci, j&rsquo;ai ce qu&rsquo;il vous faut. Cela s&rsquo;appelle <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Hyperfine</strong></a> et c&rsquo;est un outil de benchmarking qui s&rsquo;utilise en ligne de commande et qui permet de comparer les temps d&rsquo;exécution de différents programmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est très utile pour mesurer par exemple les performances des programmes qui effectuent beaucoup d&rsquo;écritures et de lectures sur un disque afin de voir comment ils se comportent avec ou sans cache, ou sur un disque dur ou un SSD. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyperfine dispose de nombreuses fonctionnalités pour vous aider à obtenir des résultats précis et fiables, notamment une analyse statistique sur plusieurs exécutions, la prise en charge de commandes shell arbitraires et un retour constant sur l&rsquo;avancement du benchmark et les estimations en cours.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-2718436\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Pour l&rsquo;utiliser, vous pouvez par exemple faire un benchmark de n&rsquo;importe quelle commande comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>hyperfine COMMANDE_A_EVALUER</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour tester la commande <code>sleep</code> par exemple, on fera comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>hyperfine 'sleep 0.3'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, par défaut, Hyperfine effectuera au moins 10 exécutions du programme et prendra sa mesure à chaque fois pendant 3 secondes pendant au moins 3 secondes. Notez que vous pouvez changer cette durée de test en utilisant l&rsquo;option <code>-r</code> ou <code>--runs</code> et en spécifiant la durée derrière.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"754\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7a31394f5978452e676966.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132051\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous souhaitez comparer les temps d&rsquo;exécution de différents programmes, vous pouvez également passer plusieurs commandes à Hyperfine. Ainsi pour pour comparer les temps d&rsquo;exécution de <code>hexdump</code> et <code>xxd</code>, vous pouvez appeler hyperfine comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>hyperfine 'hexdump VOTRE_FICHIER' 'xxd VOTRE_FICHIER'</code></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Par exemple si vous avez un doute sur les performances d&rsquo;une nouvelle version d&rsquo;un outils, Hyperfine peut vous aider à la comparer avec une version précédente.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyperfine vous permet également de réaliser des benchmarks où un seul paramètre change à chaque exécutions. Ca permet de mesurer le comportement d&rsquo;un programme en fonction des paramètres que vous lui faites digérer. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-746537889\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Au niveau des exports, c&rsquo;es top puisque vous pouvez récupérer ensuite les résultats au format CSV, JSON, Markdown&#8230;etc afin d&rsquo;analyser ensuite tout ça au calme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">c&rsquo;est un petit outil en ligne de commande</a> qui ne paye pas de mine mais qui vous sera d&rsquo;une grande aide pour faire vos benchmarks et comparer le temps d&rsquo;exécution de vos propres codes ou d&rsquo;outils tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amusez-vous bien !</p>\n",

J&rsquo;ai un beau mur blanc à la maison, un chouette canapé, et c&rsquo;est un grand plaisir de pouvoir voir un film « en grand, comme au cinéma ». </p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;habite pas à côté d&rsquo;un multiplex et le cinéma de quartier a un écran rikiki. Ajoutez à ça les sans gênes qui parlent, les grands mères qui éclairent la salle avec leur smartphone parce qu&rsquo;elle cherchent un truc dans leur sac à main ou encore les boulets qui tapent dans les sièges avec leurs gros genoux, sans oublier le prix prohibitif du ticket et l&rsquo;impossibilité de mettre en pause quand on veut faire une pause pipi&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, je suis plutôt guéri de « l&rsquo;expérience cinéma » et j&rsquo;adore mon projecteur à la maison, que j&rsquo;utilise vraiment pour cette expérience (et pas pour mater la TV de la vie de tous les jours).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On passe au test !</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ça fait donc une petite semaine que j&rsquo;ai troqué mon vieux coucou contre le <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://me.korben.info/xgimilink\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>XGIMI HORIZON Pro</strong></a> et je ne suis pas déçu de la qualité de l&rsquo;expérience. C&rsquo;est encore mieux. Ce projecteur dispose d&rsquo;un moteur optique 4K, d&rsquo;une résolution de 3840 x 2160, soit 8,29 millions de pixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/a89-xgimitrk\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Autant dire que les films sont encore plus sympa qu&rsquo;avant même si j&rsquo;ai découvert à cette occasion que Netflix voulait m&rsquo;escroquer un forfait supérieur pour de la 4K. Non merci :-).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Habituellement, regarder un film sur un projo quand il fait jour dehors, c&rsquo;est moyen. Mais avec sa luminosité de 2200 ANSI lumens, c&rsquo;est parfaitement faisable et tout aussi agréable qu&rsquo;en soirée. D&rsquo;ailleurs si vous vous demandez à quelle taille d&rsquo;écran le HORIZON Pro correspond avec sa résolution, c&rsquo;est comme si vous aviez une TV de 200 pouces de diagonales (soit 4,42 mètres sur 2,52 mètres). Gigantesque non ?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132383\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl-300x114.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/SCR-20230123-efl-768x292.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, j&rsquo;ai été impressionné par la qualité de l&rsquo;image. J&rsquo;ai fait quelques tests avec des vidéos 4K le HDR-10 (pour un max de contrastes) et X-VUE 2.0 qui permet d&rsquo;avoir une qualité de fou en terme de rendu d&rsquo;image, avec des couleurs vives, des noirs profond et même une réduction du « bruit » présent sur l&rsquo;image (+ de clarté quoi).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132510\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-1024x768.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-768x576.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/xgimi-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>La techno MEMC, que je ne connaissais pas avant, vient également améliorer la fluidité de l&rsquo;image, réduisant la latence, faisant disparaitre les images fantômes et compensant la perte de détail sur l&rsquo;image. C&rsquo;est très sympa surtout pour les amateurs de films d&rsquo;action ou les gamers qui voient ainsi leur expérience visuelle grandement améliorée (on évite la nausée).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et même si j&rsquo;ai déjà des lunettes qui filtrent la lumière bleue, et bien sachez que ce projecteur protégera vos petits yeux grâce à sa réduction native de la lumière bleue.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132516\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-1024x768.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-768x576.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9567.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Il s&rsquo;adapte à toutes les surfaces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et surtout, au niveau des fonctionnalités de réglage, je me suis régalé. Avant je devais jouer avec les molettes pour régler la netteté de l&rsquo;image, mais avec ce nouveau projecteur, c&rsquo;est un autre délire. Comme il est équipé de la technologie d&rsquo;Adaptation Intelligente de l&rsquo;Ecran (ISA), il est capable de proposer une mise au pointe entièrement automatique ainsi qu&rsquo;une correction de la distorsion trapézoïdale (si votre projo n&rsquo;est pas pile poile en face de votre mur ou que votre mur n&rsquo;est pas droit). Il dispose même d&rsquo;un mode de contournement intelligent des obstacles, ce qui permet de régler l&rsquo;affichage pour qu&rsquo;il esquive un tableau sur le mur ou une plante verte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici une démo où il esquive le fond vert et fait la mise au point tout seul. Puis je règle l&rsquo;angle de la projection avec la télécommande.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/output.webm\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour la hauteur d&rsquo;affichage, pas de pied réglable par contre. Donc il faudra vous procurer un trépied réglable, un support ou tout simplement un meuble à la bonne hauteur. Moi j&rsquo;ai juste calé un petit bouquin en dessous pour lui donner la bonne inclinaison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, ce que je peux vous dire qu&rsquo;il est très silencieux. C&rsquo;est pas une soufflerie comme d&rsquo;autres vidéo projecteur de qualité moindre. Et il embarque un système audio Harman Kardon, soit 2 haut-parleurs large bande actifs de 8 W chacun, développés spécifiquement pour lui. Du coup, j&rsquo;ai pas besoin de brancher d&rsquo;enceintes ou de mettre un casque pour avoir un son de qualité cinéma DTS-HD et DTS Studio Sound, compatible Dolby Digital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Et le logiciel ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Au niveau du soft, c&rsquo;est de l&rsquo;Android TV avec bien sûr Google Play pour pouvoir installer toutes les applications que vous voulez (Molotov, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney Plus mais également des jeux ou des applications comme Spotify&#8230;etc). Comme Android TV embarque un système de commande vocale « OK Google », vous pouvez même piloter le projecteur à la voix. Et si ce n&rsquo;est pas votre truc, il y a bien sûr une télécommande en plastique et métal avec une bonne prise en main (elle est suffisamment lourde pour ne pas faire toc) et est vraiment très agréable à utiliser.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132378\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9510-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Et évidemment pour les gamers, le projecteur dispose d&rsquo;un mode « jeu » avec une latence basse de 35ms et également d&rsquo;un mode « 3D » pour ceux qui veulent se repasser Avatar avec les lunettes. Enfin, en matière de connectivité, il y a tout ce qu&rsquo;il faut à savoir un port DC, 2 ports USB, 2 HDMI, 1 port ethernet, 1 connecteur audio, un connecteur optique, le Bluetooth 5.0 et évidemment, il se connecte en Wifi à votre routeur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si ça vous intéresse, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à vous renseigner davantage sur les fonctionnalités et les « spécificités » techniques pour vous faire une idée de tout ce que ce projecteur peut vous offrir.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>200 € de réduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Il est dispo au prix de 1 699 euros sur le site de XGIMI ou sur Amazon et <strong>avec le code promo </strong>« <strong>Korben</strong>« <strong>, vous pouvez économiser 200 euros et obtenir ce projecteur pour 1499 euros</strong> directement sur la page</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/xgimilink\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://me.korben.info/xgimilink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HORIZON PRO de XGIMI</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Offre valable jusqu&rsquo;au 6 février.</p>\n",

Du coup pour contourner ce problème, Apple a développé l&rsquo;émulateur Rosetta, qui permet d&rsquo;exécuter les applications non compatibles (pour architecture Intel quoi&#8230;) sur cette architecture ARM. C&rsquo;est cool, mais évidemment, c&rsquo;est moins performant donc il vaut mieux choper une version native de vos outils pour Silicon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>M&rsquo;enfin, si je vous parle de ça, c&rsquo;est parce que je passe ma vie dans le Terminal et parfois, certains outils fonctionnent mal également à cet endroit. J&rsquo;avais trouvé un moyen de lancer un terminal.app en mode de compatibilité Rosetta, mais Apple a bloqué la possibilité de dupliquer l&rsquo;application Terminal.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-imh-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131966\" width=\"243\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-imh-2.webp 344w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-imh-2-138x300.webp 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Tant pis, j&rsquo;ai trouvé une autre solution que je vous présente et qui est assez simple. Cela se passe au niveau de votre fichier .zshrc. Pour rappel, ce fichier de configuration est utilisé par le shell ZSH sur les systèmes d&rsquo;exploitation Unix / Linux, et donc macOS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il est consulté à chaque fois que ZSH est lancé et permet de personnaliser les paramètres et les comportements de ZSH selon vos préférences. Cela permet par exemple de changer le look de l&rsquo;interface de commande, d&rsquo;ajouter des alias ou encore des chemins d&rsquo;accès. Si vous n&rsquo;avez pas de Shell ZSH sur votre macOS, vous pouvez l&rsquo;activer par défaut en lançant un terminal et en tapant cette ligne de commande : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1640447358\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Nous aujourd&rsquo;hui, on va ajouter ces fameux alias pour pouvoir avoir un terminal compatible ARM ou INTEL à la demande. Ouvrez à nouveau un terminal sur votre Mac, et lancez la commande suivante pour ouvrir le fichier de config : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>nano ~/.zshrc</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajoutez ensuite les 2 alias suivants dans le fichier, à la fin de celui-ci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>alias arm=\"env /usr/bin/arch -arm64 /bin/zsh --login\"\nalias intel=\"env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh --login\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, je crée donc 2 alias : arm et intel qui vont permettre de changer l&rsquo;architecture utilisée par votre terminal zsh. C&rsquo;est aussi simple que cela. Voici ce que ça donne :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-gmr.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131967\" width=\"615\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-gmr.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-gmr-300x212.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221218-gmr-768x544.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sauvegardez et quittez (CTRL+O puis CTRL+X).

Je suis retourné également au cinéma pour la dernière fois de ma vie, je pense, tant certains humains qui fréquentent les salles obscures font tout pour gâcher le plaisir des autres.

Voici un exemple de code pour illustrer la création d&rsquo;un nouveau fichier Excel et ajouter une feuille de calcul et une valeur à cette feuille. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/xuri/excelize/v2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    f := excelize.NewFile()\n    // Créer une nouvelle feuille.\n    index := f.NewSheet(\"Sheet2\")\n    // Définir la valeur d'une cellule.\n    f.SetCellValue(\"Sheet2\", \"A2\", \"Hello world.\")\n    f.SetCellValue(\"Sheet1\", \"B2\", 100)\n    // Définir la feuille active du classeur.\n    f.SetActiveSheet(index)\n    // Enregistrer le fichier xlsx par le chemin donné.\n    if err := f.SaveAs(\"Book1.xlsx\"); err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-100380283\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Easyyyy ! </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131924\" width=\"781\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grid_0-2-1-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, pour lire un fichier Excel, vous pouvez utiliser la méthode « ReadFile » comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n\n    \"github.com/xuri/excelize/v2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    f, err := excelize.OpenFile(\"Book1.xlsx\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    defer func() {\n        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {\n            fmt.Println(err)\n        }\n    }()\n    // Obtenir la valeur de la cellule par nom de feuille de calcul donné et axe.\n    cell, err := f.GetCellValue(\"Sheet1\", \"B2\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    fmt.Println(cell)\n    // Obtenez toutes les lignes de la feuille Sheet1.\n    rows, err := f.GetRows(\"Sheet1\")\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Println(err)\n        return\n    }\n    for _, row := range rows {\n        for _, colCell := range row {\n            fmt.Print(colCell, \"\\t\")\n        }\n        fmt.Println()\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xuri.me/excelize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pratique non ?</a></p>\n",

On peut également étendre ses fonctionnalités avec des modules si besoin.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/resizeHorizontal.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131906\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En termes de fonctionnalités, il permet d&rsquo;éditer des vidéos, d&rsquo;en créer « from scratch » à partir de couleurs et d&rsquo;effets aléatoirement générés et il prend en charge de toutes les résolutions comme des vidéos 4K ou des photos DSLR. Au niveau des exports, c&rsquo;est pareil, il peut aussi bien pondre un post Instagram (1:1), une story Instagram (9:16), un format pour YouTube (16:9) ou toutes les autres dimensions dont vous avez besoin. C&rsquo;est vraiment un outil génial pour les créateurs qui font de la vidéo et qui ont besoin de sortir un même contenu sur plusieurs plateformes qui acceptent des formats et des tailles de vidéos différentes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1763237998\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Voici un rendu d&rsquo;une vidéo produite avec Editly : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"This video was created from code!

Il supporte également du JavaScript / HTML5 Canvas / Fabric.js pour tout ce qui est « écrans personnalisés » ou pour pouvoir ajouter des superpositions dynamiques sur les vidéos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pourrez également exporter un GIF, ajouter des effets de vignette, conserver 1 seule source audio ou au contraire en mixer plusieurs, ou encore rajouter des fondus automatiques et de la normalisation sur le son.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ce qui concerne l&rsquo;installation, cette merveille peut fonctionner sous Windows, macOS ou Linux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour l&rsquo;installer, vous devez entrer la commande suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm i -g editly</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois installé, vous pourrez alors utiliser l&rsquo;interface en ligne de commande pour assembler rapidement une vidéo ou utiliser son API JavaScript  pour créer des choses plus complexes. Et comme je l&rsquo;évoquais avant, vous pouvez également utiliser des fichiers JSON pour spécifier les paramètres du montage attendu. Je vous invite à lire la documentation pour en savoir plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1143698013\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Ce mode de fonctionnement « automatisé » de l&rsquo;édition vidéo va vous faire gagner un max de temps si vous souhaitez par exemple créer un diaporama à partir de dizaines d&rsquo;images en rajoutant du texte par-dessus, ou encore créer une bande-annonce ou une vidéo promo.

Cette société qui a l&rsquo;ambition de changer le visage de la robotique en plaçant l&rsquo;imaginaire au cœur de la technologie a donc pour objectif de créer des « robots-personnages » qui sont à la fois performants dans leur travail, mais qui offrent également une expérience inédite pour les personnes qui le croisent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je ne savais vraiment pas ce que j&rsquo;allais voir et la surprise a été très agréable. La société porte bien son nom, puisque lors de la présentation, Miroki n&rsquo;a pas été présenté comme un robot purement fonctionnel, mais vraiment comme un personnage avec son univers, son histoire, etc. L&rsquo;objectif étant, je pense, d&rsquo;éviter l&rsquo;effet Uncanny Valley bien connu des concepteurs de robots humanoïdes, qui est le malaise ressenti par les personnes en présence d&rsquo;entités artificielles proches de l&rsquo;apparence humaine, mais pas tout à fait identiques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce robot qui nous a donc été dévoilé s&rsquo;appelle Miroki et il a été conçu et développé en moins d&rsquo;un an (un record !!) par les ingénieurs d&rsquo;Enchanted Tools. Pour la petite histoire, Miroki vient d&rsquo;une planète lointaine baptisée Miroko et décide de débarquer sur Terre pour venir nous rencontrer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Enchanted Tools — L&#039;origine des Mirokaï (Version Française)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CVPKgBw4S7k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Certains diront qu&rsquo;il a été ensuite réduit en esclavage par les humains, mais je vous assure qu&rsquo;il vient bosser de son plein gré ^^.

Par exemple, comme mentionné sur cette pages, avec cette lib, vous pouvez coder des outils pour faire des trucs très cool comme : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ArpSpoofing</strong>: une application qui utilise les fonctionnalités de Packet++ et Pcap++ pour effectuer du spoofing ARP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Arping</strong>: une implémentation de l&rsquo;utilitaire arping en utilisant PcapPlusPlus.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DnsSpoofing</strong>: un utilitaire en ligne de commande qui effectue du spoofing DNS en utilisant Packet++ et Pcap++.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DNSResolver</strong>: un utilitaire en ligne de commande qui résout les adresses IPv4 pour un nom d&rsquo;hôte en utilisant les protocoles ARP et DNS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>IcmpFileTransfer</strong>: une application qui montre comment transférer des fichiers entre deux machines en utilisant uniquement des messages ICMP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>HttpAnalyzer</strong>: une application qui analyse le trafic HTTP et fournit des informations détaillées sur le trafic, comme le nombre et le taux de paquets, la bande passante, le nombre et le taux de flux, les requêtes et les réponses HTTP, l&rsquo;histogramme des noms d&rsquo;hôte, l&rsquo;histogramme des types de contenu, l&rsquo;histogramme des codes d&rsquo;état et bien plus encore. Peut fonctionner sur du trafic en direct ou lire des paquets depuis un fichier pcap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SSLAnalyzer</strong>: une application qui analyse le trafic SSL/TLS et fournit des informations détaillées sur le trafic, comme le nombre et le taux de paquets, la bande passante, le nombre et le taux de flux, le nombre de messages SSL/TLS, l&rsquo;histogramme des noms d&rsquo;hôte, le nombre de versions SSL/TLS, le nombre de suites de chiffrement et bien plus encore. Peut fonctionner sur du trafic en direct ou lire des paquets depuis un fichier pcap.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme cette lib C++ est conçue pour être extrêmement rapide et légère, cela lui permet de traiter tous ces paquets très rapidement avec très peu de charge sur le système. Vous pourrez bien évidement l&rsquo;utiliser sur votre OS, que ce soit du Windows, du MacOS, du Linux, de l&rsquo;Android ou encore FreeBSD (les sources sont disponibles).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici un exemple d&rsquo;implémentation pour lire des paquets : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>// create a pcap file reader\npcpp::PcapFileReaderDevice pcapReader(\"input.pcap\");\npcapReader.open();\n\n// create a pcapng file writer\npcpp::PcapNgFileWriterDevice pcapNgWriter(\"output.pcapng\");\npcapNgWriter.open();\n\n// raw packet object\npcpp::RawPacket rawPacket;\n\n// read packets from pcap reader and write pcapng writer\nwhile (pcapReader->getNextPacket(rawPacket)) {\n  pcapNgWriter.writePacket(rawPacket);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une interface graphique facile à utiliser permet également de lire et d&rsquo;écrire ces fameuses trames réseau dans des fichiers, prenant ainsi en charge les formats de fichier PCAP et PCAPNG. De plus, il contient une implémentation unique de techniques de réassemblage de paquets, notamment le réassemblage TCP qui prend en charge la retransmission TCP, les paquets TCP hors ordre et les données TCP manquantes, ainsi que la fragmentation et le défragmentation IP pour créer et réassembler des fragments IPv4 et IPv6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avec <a href=\"https://pcapplusplus.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PcapPlusPlus</a> vous pourrez également filtrer les paquets ou générer des empreintes numériques TLS pour cibler et identifier les paquets réseau de manière beaucoup plus précise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, tout ça pour dire que si votre cafetière est connectée sur le réseau, PcapPlusPlus peut même faire le café !</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-462214832\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Allez, pour installer ce truc, <a href=\"https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/quickstart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">toute la doc est là !</a> Amusez vous bien !</p>\n",

Et aujourd&rsquo;hui je vais aborder l&rsquo;aspect de l&rsquo;enrichissement des données et comment Incogni peut aider sur ce point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais d&rsquo;abord on va commencer par le début : <strong>c&rsquo;est quoi l&rsquo;enrichissement des données</strong> ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous savez déjà que l&rsquo;Internet vous scrute avec des jumelles et que la plupart des acteurs essayent de gratter le maximum d&rsquo;informations vous concernant. Plus il y en a, plus elles sont personnelles et mieux c&rsquo;est pour eux puisqu&rsquo;il peuvent dresser un profil de plus en plus précis. Et ce qui permet d&rsquo;avoir cette précision c&rsquo;est souvent via le recoupement depuis plusieurs sources.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"626\" height=\"417\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/i6u-incogni-enrichissement\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous donnez vos nom, prénom et adresse mail pour télécharger un livre blanc sur un site marketing ? Vous avez un compte fidélité sur un site e-commerce de produits de santé spécifiques (asthme, maladie cardiaque &#8230;) et&nbsp;sur lequel vous êtes connecté avec le même email ? Vous répondez à un sondage sur les bienfaits du mariage? Vous avez une société pour laquelle&nbsp;nom, prénom, adresse &amp; Co&nbsp;se trouvent sur des sites officiels publics ? Et bien en mixant&nbsp;toutes ces sources&nbsp;on obtient un profil assez complet de qui vous êtes via&nbsp;cette méthode de l&rsquo;enrichissement de données. Ces différentes données peuvent être récupérées soit tout à fait légalement, soit <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">via des data brokers</a>, des bases&nbsp;en vente au marché noir, des fuites de données, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Korben : adolescent autour de la quarantaine,&nbsp;multiples enfants, habite l&rsquo;Élysée, achète en ligne (le plus souvent des produits écologiques et des frites surgelées), s&rsquo;inquiète de sa tension artérielle et a téléchargé l&rsquo;ebook « bien manger avec ses mains ». FLIPPANT DE PERTINENCE !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"264\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/bEVKYB487Lqxy/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce qu&rsquo;il faut comprendre c&rsquo;est que le plus souvent ce n&rsquo;est pas&nbsp;fait de manière illégale par ceux qui proposent un produit ou un service. Chacun va vous&nbsp;demander les informations dont il a besoin pour satisfaire son offre, mieux cibler sa publicité ou générer sa liste d&rsquo;abonnés,&nbsp;mais sans abuser non plus. Prenons l&rsquo;exemple du livre blanc au format PDF, est-ce que vous le demanderiez si le site vous demandait votre adresse physique,&nbsp;votre situation familiale&nbsp;ou autre ? Bien sûr que non, vous l&rsquo;enverriez&nbsp;sur les roses (avec raison). Idem si WhatsApp vous demandait de fournir un carnet de santé ou vos rémunérations mensuelles. Par contre les bases de données de ces sites ou la newsletter d&rsquo;un blog peut avoir été hackées sans même que leurs créateurs ne soient au courant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres services vous disent carrément qu&rsquo;ils récolteront des données vous concernant via d&rsquo;autres sites ou applis&nbsp;sur lesquelles vous êtes présents. Mais comme personne ne lit les petits caractères et que les termes employés sont volontairement vagues &#8230; ça passe. Des exemples ? Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Google ou Twitter. En signant chez eux, vous leur donnez le droit d&rsquo;aller chercher vos informations ailleurs (avec certaines limites et une anonymisation des données &#8230; normalement). Imaginez que vous ayez un profil tout ce qu&rsquo;il y a de plus corporate sur Facebook et que vous utilisiez Twitter pour propager des conspirations platistes ou reptiliennes&nbsp;à longueur de journée de manière anonyme. Et que vous avez utilisé le même mail ou le même téléphone pour les 2. Juste, imaginez.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"281\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/rr1DGz8pXZVHVDZyu6/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn est un bon exemple qui permet l&rsquo;enrichissement de données. Vous vous inscrivez sur un site quelconque avec nom et prénom et la société derrière ce site peut aller faire une recherche LinkedIn pour enrichir votre profil avec votre poste, l&rsquo;entreprise dans laquelle vous travaillez et autres infos. Ce qui va leur permettre d&rsquo;affiner leur communication avec vous, voire d&rsquo;aller vous relancer directement sur le réseau.

Une fois qu&rsquo;il vous aura donné la liste de ceux-ci, il va les contacter tous pour leur demander d&rsquo;effacer toute trace de votre existence.

C&rsquo;est un travail en cours de développement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131873\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg.webp 924w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg-300x244.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-geg-768x623.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est intéressant avec Cytopia, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il est en constante évolution. Les développeurs sont sans cesse en train de travailler sur de nouvelles fonctionnalités pour améliorer l&rsquo;expérience de jeu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Par exemple, ils prévoient d&rsquo;ajouter des biomes, ces grandes régions géographiques qui ont leur propre climat et leur propre faune et flore. Cela ajoutera une nouvelle dimension à la construction de vos villes, car vous devrez tenir compte des conditions climatiques et écologiques de chaque biome lorsque vous construirez vos quartiers et vos routes.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"924\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131874\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9.webp 924w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9-300x244.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-gg9-768x623.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1068580014\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Les développeurs travaillent également sur un mécanisme de téléchargement de mods directement dans le jeu. Vous pourrez ainsi facilement télécharger les mods créés par d&rsquo;autres joueurs pour ajouter de nouvelles fonctionnalités, de nouvelles possibilités de constructions voire de nouveaux univers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bientôt des villes sur Mars ? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et comme Cytopia est un jeu open source, vous pourrez évidemment créer vos propres mods perso si vous le souhaitez. Bien sûr, Cytopia ne néglige pas non plus l&rsquo;aspect musical du jeu. Le jeu possède sa bande-son originale avec des bruits ambiants et des effets sonores qui sont tout simplement excellents. Vous vous sentirez vraiment immergé dans votre ville virtuelle rien qu&rsquo;à vous.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131875\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/jimmy2_2-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cytopia est disponible sur macOS, Linux et Windows, et il devrait également y avoir une version pour Android et iOS à l&rsquo;avenir. Les développeurs travaillent également sur un langage de script similaire à du LUA pour faciliter la création de mods. Si vous êtes intéressé par le développement de Cytopia, vous pouvez retrouver <a href=\"https://github.com/CytopiaTeam/Cytopia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">le code sur Github</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;hésitez pas à essayer le jeu et à vous impliquer dans la communauté des joueurs et des développeurs si le coeur vous en dit !</p>\n",

Par exemple, vous pouvez configurer un raccourci pour ouvrir un nouveau document dans votre traitement de texte préféré, ou pour lancer une recherche sur internet dans votre navigateur. Cela vous permet d&rsquo;accéder rapidement aux fonctionnalités que vous utilisez le plus souvent, sans avoir à naviguer dans les menus de l&rsquo;application ou à utiliser des combinaisons de touches compliquées. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1377407415\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Par exemple pour lancer quelques scripts Python, c&rsquo;est génial !</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gbammc/Thor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici !</a></p>\n",

Cela peut vous paraitre abusé, mais vous n&rsquo;imaginez pas le nombre de conneries que les gens peuvent dire avec certitude. Je vous encourage à vérifier également (et discrètement).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais savoir correctement utiliser un moteur de recherche et surtout faire du tri dans les informations qui sont renvoyées, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcement simple pour tout le monde. Il faut beaucoup de pratique pour éviter les sites chelous ou les conneries de fake news que les gens adorent se repasser parce que ça les conforte dans leurs délires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bien qu&rsquo;il ne soit pas parfait, Andi est peut-être le moteur de recherche du futur. C&rsquo;est un genre de chatbot capable de répondre à toutes vos questions pour peu que vous les écriviez en anglais. Hé oui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il y a quelques semaine, <a href=\"https://korben.info/chatgpt-openai.html\"><strong>j&rsquo;ai d&rsquo;ailleurs écrit un article sur OpenAI</strong></a> qui a lancé un chatbot, basé sur son algo GPT-3, qui utilise de l&rsquo;intelligence artificielle pour générer des réponses à des questions complexes. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-79307429\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Comme GPT-3, Andi est capable de fouiller des sources de contenus pour trouver les informations pertinentes et de les présenter de manière synthétique. Cependant, contrairement à Andi, qui se concentre sur les réponses aux questions, GPT-3 peut aussi générer du texte original sur un large éventail de sujets. En utilisant l&rsquo;intelligence artificielle pour traiter les données, ces outils peuvent fournir des réponses plus précises et plus complètes que ce que nous serions capables de faire manuellement. C&rsquo;est vraiment top !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andi peut ainsi répondre à des questions basiques comme « Quelle heure est-il ? » ou encore « Quelle est la capitale de l&rsquo;Italie ?&rsquo; &#8230;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-t57.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131723\" width=\"283\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-t57.webp 604w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-t57-242x300.webp 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>&#8230;ou des choses un peu plus complexes, sans aucune difficulté. Pour cela il sélectionne une liste de sources de contenus qui correspondent à votre demande et est capable de les analyser pour en sortir l&rsquo;essentiel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je lui ai demandé de me faire un résumé de la théorie des cordes et voici ce qu&rsquo;il m&rsquo;a répondu : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131727\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq-300x208.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221202-chq-768x531.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plutôt pas mal non ?

Ça me parait impossible et je suis de ceux qui pensent que Twitter a encore une belle et longue vie devant lui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez exporté vos données Twitter, vous avez dû remarquer que vous pouvez consulter tout ça au travers d&rsquo;une page HTML fournie dans l&rsquo;archive. Mais celle-ci présente plusieurs problèmes. Par exemple, si vous cliquez sur l&rsquo;une des images contenues dans un tweet, vous êtes renvoyé vers le site de Twitter. Ce qui est complètement con si demain votre compte est supprimé ou que Twitter disparait.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131709\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq-300x146.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq-768x374.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Comment télécharger une archive de vos données Twitter ?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme les tweets sont archivés en JSON, il est compliqué de simplement les copier-coller pour les mettre ailleurs. Même les images fournies ne sont pas exactement identiques à celles que vous avez envoyées. Elles sont étrangement plus petites. C&rsquo;est dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant les DM, même s&rsquo;ils sont présents dans l&rsquo;archive, on ne peut pas savoir qui les a envoyés puisque les noms des émetteurs ont été retirés de l&rsquo;archive. Enfin, les liens inclus dans les messages ne sont pas en clair, mais sont raccourcis. Donc impossible de savoir de quoi ça cause sans cliquer dessus. Et surtout, si un jour Twitter retire son domaine lié aux URLs raccourcies, et bien plus aucun de ces liens ne fonctionnera.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1495201034\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Tous ces petits détails ont incité Tim Hutton et ses amis à agir en proposant un script baptisé Twitter Archive Parser qui « répare » tous ces défauts. En effet, une fois lancé comme ceci sur votre archive&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python parser.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le script se charge alors de convertir tous vos tweets en markdown et HTML en y intégrant les bonnes images (dans leur taille d&rsquo;origine), les vidéos et les liens intégrés. Toutes les URLs raccourcies t.co sont ainsi remplacées par les vrais liens et les images récupérées sont stockées dans un dossier spécifique pour que vous puissiez ensuite les utiliser ou les stocker ailleurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131713\" width=\"351\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54.webp 635w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54-254x300.webp 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si des pseudos sont absents de l&rsquo;archive, ce parser est également capable de retrouver tous ces identifiants manquants directement depuis Twitter.com pour les réintégrer dans l&rsquo;archive. Les DMs sont également convertis en markdown avec leurs médias, leurs liens en clair et bien sûr le pseudo des gens qui vous les ont envoyés.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, l&rsquo;outil récupère également une liste de vos followers et de vos followings ce qui peut également servir pour d&rsquo;autres choses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si le script pour intéresse, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser\" target=\"_blank\">son code est sur Github ainsi que les explications techniques pour le lancer</a>.</p>\n",

Vous installez ntfy sur <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a> (<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">F-Droid</a>) ou <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS</a> et une fois que c&rsquo;est fait, vous choisissez un « topic » qui est un genre de clé. Cette clé est publique donc créez quelque chose de random et assez long pour que personne ne puisse la deviner. Autrement, quelqu&rsquo;un pourra s&rsquo;amuser à vous envoyer des notifications. Pour l&rsquo;exemple, je vais choisir « korben1234 »</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"338\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed.webp 338w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed-135x300.webp 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, il y a plus qu&rsquo;à balancer la notification via Curl comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>curl -d \"Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀\" ntfy.sh/korben1234</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>En Python, ça donnerait ça : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>requests.post(\"https://ntfy.sh/korben1234\",\n    data=\"Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀\".encode(encoding='utf-8'))</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1035933728\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>En JavaScript : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>fetch('https://ntfy.sh/korben1234', {\n    method: 'POST', // PUT works too\n    body: 'Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀'\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est aussi simple que ça, avec un simple POST HTTP, vous pouvez recevoir ces petites alertes bien pratiques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici une démo en vidéo : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-prise-en-charge-des-contenus-embarques wp-block-embed-prise-en-charge-des-contenus-embarques\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-131698-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4\">https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4</a></video></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez personnaliser les entêtes du message, mettre une icône, joindre une image, mettre un titre et bien d&rsquo;autres choses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est le genre de petit service qui n&rsquo;a l&rsquo;air de rien, mais qui fait des miracles et sait rapidement se rendre indispensable. Ce qui est cool avec ntfy, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez <a href=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">l&rsquo;héberger vous-même</a> puisque le projet est open source.

La première, c&rsquo;est un clone de Daisy Disk (logiciel payant) qui vous permet de débusquer les fichiers les plus gros qui trainent sur votre ordinateur. Si vous avez de vieux films, de gros zip ou des programmes d&rsquo;install volumineux, celui-ci saura les retrouver et vous pourrez les dégager d&rsquo;un simple clic.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131682\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La seconde fonctionnalité vous permettra de partir à la chasse de tous les fichiers que vous avez en double. De quoi dégraisser le Willy sans douleur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131685\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Enfin, la dernière fonctionnalité nommée « Organizer » va vous permettre de faire le tri dans un répertoire en passant très rapidement en revue tout ce qui s&rsquo;y trouve pour le supprimer ou le classer dans des répertoires. Cette fonctionnalité est très utile si vous êtes comme moi et que vous stockez des centaines de fichiers dans des dossiers sans vraiment savoir ce qu&rsquo;il y a dedans. Vous pourrez facilement identifier les fichiers que vous n&rsquo;avez pas utilisés depuis longtemps et les supprimer pour gagner de l&rsquo;espace sur votre disque dur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131686\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme je le disais, Shorui est gratuit et c&rsquo;est vraiment pratique !

Il nous explique les règles, le déroulement, on se déplace sur une carte et à chaque arrêt, on va pouvoir modifier son deck (ajouts, modifications de cartes, etc.) ou combattre avec. Si l&rsquo;on perd, on recommence à zéro. Enfin pas totalement, car on débloque quand même des éléments qui vont rester d&rsquo;une partie à l&rsquo;autre. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-90183500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Au niveau du jeu en lui-même, le système ressemble à ce qu&rsquo;on peut connaître chez <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/fr-fr\" target=\"_blank\">Hearthstone</a>, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/fr\" target=\"_blank\">Magic the Gathering</a>, etc. mais bien sûr avec des subtilités qui lui sont propres (par exemple, il faut sacrifier une carte pour pouvoir en jouer une autre !

Pourtant il n&rsquo;est pas exempt de défauts, on va en parler, mais disons que le hérisson bleu n&rsquo;avait jamais réussi à me convaincre totalement depuis son passage à la troisième dimension. Certains titres étaient plutôt réussis (les Sonic Adventure, Generations, Colours, ou même Secrets Rings si si) mais j&rsquo;étais loin d&rsquo;y prendre autant de plaisir que sur Megadrive, ou plus récemment sur <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QcnqB1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonic Mania</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ça démarrait plutôt mal : des environnements « réalistes » un peu ternes et vides, des ennemis au design triste et grisâtre, un aspect sonore très épuré avec de faux airs de <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3icYk8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breath of the Wild</a>, des structures (rampes, loopings, ressorts…) qui semblent flotter dans le ciel… Bref, pas très envie d&rsquo;y jouer…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132059\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">La magie opère !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pourtant, manette en main, ça fonctionne !

Par exemple, résoudre une énigme, réaliser un défi trouvé en chemin, entrer dans le cyberespace et faire la course dans un niveau « classique », se caler une <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NZMTMPZULU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">session de pêche avec Big The Cat</a>, dégommer un mini-boss… En faisant tout ça, on va obtenir des clefs, qui nous permettent de débloquer les <em>Chaos Emeralds</em>, qui nous permettent ensuite d&rsquo;affronter le boss de l&rsquo;île en mode Super Sonic ! 🔥</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132060\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Chaque combat demande une approche différente</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est simple mais sympa à suivre, les répliques sont bien écrites, on retrouve bien la personnalité de nos héros favoris, d&rsquo;ailleurs, bravo à l&rsquo;équipe de doublage car la version française est chouette ! Aussi, les musiques sont super variées, y a quelques titres vraiment entrainants. 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On déplore de rares soucis de maniabilité, et certaines phases de jeu frustrantes (le flipper par exemple…) qui entachent un peu l&rsquo;expérience. Aussi, les graphismes sur la version Switch sont un peu à la ramasse, c&rsquo;est parfois moche. Sur PC et consoles <em>nextgen</em>, le résultat est beaucoup plus agréable voire franchement joli, même si les îles restent trop vides et ternes à mon goût. J&rsquo;espère que dans une future suite, ils sauront nous proposer des mondes plus colorés et plus vivants !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Les niveaux du cyberespace sont chatoyants, eux !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Il n&#8217;empêche que c&rsquo;est un jeu vraiment agréable, pas prise de tête, qui nous propose du fun immédiat, une très bonne durée de vie… Et d&rsquo;ailleurs, des DLCs gratuits vont sortir tout au long de l&rsquo;année avec notamment de nouveaux personnages jouables (Tails, Amy Rose&#8230; &amp; Knuckles). 😉 Alors malgré ses défauts je ne peux que vous conseiller la dernière aventure de mon hérisson favori !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Acheter Sonic Frontiers sur <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jLRYgR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GeFGoz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 4</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ieloUf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 5</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GdOvPw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox Series S</a></h2>\n",

Apparue en 2009 sur les consoles <em>nextgen</em> de l&rsquo;époque, la licence est devenue une exclusivité Nintendo en 2014 avec la sortie de la première suite sur WiiU.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Bayonetta 3 – La sorcière en action (Nintendo Switch)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHt6drrs-Ww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Il aura fallu attendre 8 ans, rien que ça, pour <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q7vYJr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">la retrouver sur Switch</a> afin de dégommer les anges avec style et cheveux. Parce que voilà, si vous ne le saviez pas, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q7vYJr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bayonetta</a> est une sorcière qui utilise ses cheveux pour invoquer toutes sortes de choses, principalement des démons, mais aussi ses vêtements&#8230; C&rsquo;est pour ça que parfois elle est à moitié à poil. 😅 Rien de choquant je vous rassure, mais ça peut être un peu gênant si quelqu&rsquo;un vous regarde jouer par-dessus l&rsquo;épaule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un élément parmi d&rsquo;autres qui caractérisent cette ambiance complètement barrée, baroque, <em>over the top</em> : le scénario, lui aussi, part dans toutes les directions. C&rsquo;est vraiment fun, inattendu, appuyé par une mise en scène extrêmement généreuse. Des villes entières sont détruites, on se balade dans le multivers, on rencontre de nouveaux personnages, et aussi de nouveaux <em>gameplays</em> : l&rsquo;expérience est extrêmement variée !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132038\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Contrairement aux apparences, l&rsquo;action reste super lisible</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On reste sur une base de <em>beat&#8217;em all</em> / <em>hack&rsquo;n&rsquo;slash</em>, avec des combos et un système de <em>scoring</em> poussé. Si le jeu est facile à prendre en main, maîtriser les subtilités et enchaîner les platines ne sera pas une mince affaire ! Il y a pas mal de coups, d&rsquo;armes, de démons à débloquer, ce qui fait qu&rsquo;on découvre toujours de nouvelles choses, on enchaîne les combats sans se lasser. Les phases d&rsquo;explorations donnent envie de tout découvrir, y a plein de choses à trouver, bref, sur le contenu là aussi c&rsquo;est très généreux.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1243728482\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Mon niveau préféré se déroule en plein Paris, ambiance post-apo : sous une lune rouge on tabasse un gros monstre sur le toit de l&rsquo;arc de triomphe, puis on est poursuivi par une horde de flics zombifiés qui se mettent à danser façon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thriller</a>, pour finir avec un hommage au <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cinqui%C3%A8me_%C3%89l%C3%A9ment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cinquième Élément</a> (preuve de bon goût car il s&rsquo;agit du meilleur film du monde, non ?)… Ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un petit aperçu de ce qui vous attend !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132039\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Viola, nouveau personnage jouable, propose un gameplay plus agressif</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore une fois (et c&rsquo;est pour ça que je vous en parle), il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un titre que j&rsquo;ai beaucoup apprécié. Tout est fun et débile, le contenu est gargantuesque, la durée de vie est conséquente, le <em>gameplay</em> est doté d&rsquo;une profondeur saisissante.

Ainsi, vous pourrez récupérer une image PNG de la zone, convertir des coordonnées GPS, lancer une recherche Flickr ou Twitter sur la zone ciblée, ouvrir un éditeur GPX, calculer des distances entre deux points&#8230;et ainsi de suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors comment ça s&rsquo;utilise ? Et bien tout d&rsquo;abord, ajoutez un signet (bookmarklet) à votre navigateur en faisant glisser le lien suivant vers votre barre de signets : <a href=\"//tankaru.github.io/OpenSwitchMapsWeb/index.html#'+location.href;})();\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenSwitchMaps Web</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou en ajoutant la fonction suivant dans un bookmark :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>JavaScript:(function(){ window.location.href='https://tankaru.github.io/OpenSwitchMapsWeb/index.html#'+location.href;})();</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, ouvrez Google Maps ou un équivalent puis cliquez sur le bookmark. Et voilà, vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à choisir le service qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est super intéressant et pratique si vous interagissez souvent avec des services de cartographie et je suis certain que vous allez découvrir plein de services cools.</p>\n",

En effet, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarovaya_law#:~:text=The%20Yarovaya%20law%20(in%20Russian,terror%20and%20public%20safety%20measures.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">depuis 2016, la Russie oblige les prestataires Telecom</a> à conserver tous le contenu des appels audio, les données, les images et les messages textes qui seraient présents sur des serveurs localisés en Russie, ainsi que les métadonnées et cela pour 6 mois. Toujours d&rsquo;après cette loi, les réseaux sociaux ou logiciels de messagerie qui utilisent du chiffrement sont également forcés de conserver un accès aux communications chiffrées pour le FSB.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131601\" width=\"602\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;objectif avec <a href=\"https://spybuster.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SpyBuster</strong></a> est donc de détecter les logiciels qui auraient des connexions avec des serveurs russes.

D&rsquo;ailleurs, ce qui serait cool, c&rsquo;est que MacPaw étende ce logiciel à d&rsquo;autres pays sympathiques comme la Chine ou les États-Unis qui eux aussi ne se privent pas de piller les données personnelles des internautes.

J&rsquo;en ai déjà parlé plusieurs fois sur le site et selon différents angles : <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">faire respecter vos droits RGPD</a>, <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">lutter contre les data brokers</a>, faire effacer ses données personnelles, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais l&rsquo;outil a aussi une bonne raison d&rsquo;exister pour d&rsquo;autres problèmes annexes que l&rsquo;on peut rencontrer au cas par cas. Moins fréquents que ceux déjà cités, mais qui existe malgré tout. C&rsquo;est le cas par exemple des arnaques au CPF, ou Compte Professionnel de Formation. Arnaques qui sont en constante augmentation depuis plusieurs années, jusqu&rsquo;à représenter presque&nbsp;45 millions d&rsquo;euros en 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"267\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/14i-incognicpf\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme vous le savez, en France et depuis 2015, chaque personne active professionnellement&nbsp;recevait chaque année un crédit d&rsquo;heures donnant droit à suivre des formations. Sauf que depuis 2019 ce crédit d&rsquo;heures a été remplacé par de la moula, chaque travailleur&nbsp;reçoit sur&nbsp;un compte&nbsp;une certaine somme à dépenser « comme il veut ». Pas en frais de restaurant ou en vacances au soleil, calmez-vous hein, mais disons que chacun peut maintenant choisir le type de service qu&rsquo;il veut utiliser avec plus de latitude (formation en ligne, etc.). Plus de 38 millions de français reçoivent ainsi plusieurs centaines d&rsquo;euros chaque année, ça fait de belles sommes. Et qui dit pognon à se faire, dit vautours.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"488\" height=\"275\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/12huzxtUKCLVTy/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Des gens à plumer ? I&rsquo;m in.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sont donc apparus des escrocs qui ont commencé à se faire passer pour des organismes ou centres de formation officiels et qui cherchent à récupérer les fonds disponibles. Vous commencez donc à recevoir des mails/SMS/appels dans lesquels on va soit vous proposer une fausse formation (souvent assez cher), soit vous demander de vous connecter à votre compte formation via un lien qu&rsquo;ils vous fournissent (et à travers lequel ils vont être capable de voler vos identifiants).&nbsp;Certains allant même jusqu&rsquo;à vous suivre sur les réseaux sociaux pour vous démarcher. Et une fois que vous leur avez&nbsp;envoyé votre crédit,&nbsp;ils vont disparaitre dans la nature. En récupérant au passage&nbsp;vos informations personnelles qui pourront éventuellement leur servir également (revente à des data brokers, usurpation d&rsquo;identité, vol de mot de passe, etc.). Pas de gaspillage ma bonne dame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;ailleurs un petit rappel : vos droits à la formation n&rsquo;ont pas de limite maximale d&rsquo;utilisation, vous pouvez les utiliser quand vous voulez (dans 6 mois ou dans 10 ans). Avant de payer une formation quelconque, prenez le temps de vérifier qu&rsquo;elle est dans les clous, reconnue et validée. Ne vous contentez pas d&rsquo;une mention sur leur site web éventuel. Cela arrive plus souvent que vous ne le pensez, plusieurs milliers de travailleurs se font avoir chaque année. Si cela a été votre cas, vous pouvez le <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.moncompteformation.gouv.fr/espace-public/comment-signaler-une-escroquerie-sur-mon-compte-formation\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.moncompteformation.gouv.fr/espace-public/comment-signaler-une-escroquerie-sur-mon-compte-formation\" target=\"_blank\">signaler ici</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation.jpg\" alt=\"Mon compte formation\" class=\"wp-image-131930\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation-300x74.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Même si une loi&nbsp;devrait être mise en place bientôt pour réguler un peu tout ça (interdiction de démarchage abusif, référencement des organismes, etc.), il n&rsquo;en reste pas moins que vous avez des armes à votre disposition dès aujourd&rsquo;hui, <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dont Incogni</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avec Incogni, vous avez la possibilité de contrôler les informations personnelles qui sont accessibles sur le web. Vous pouvez ainsi demander aux services qui ont stocké des informations sur vous de les supprimer. Cependant, il est important de noter que ces services peuvent choisir de ne pas répondre à cette demande, en fonction de leurs propres politiques et de la loi en vigueur. Si cela se produit, le service Incogni peut intervenir pour s&rsquo;assurer que la demande est traitée de manière appropriée, mais il ne peut pas garantir que toutes les informations seront effectivement supprimées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pour avoir utilisé Incogni personnellement, je peux vous dire que l&rsquo;on ne se rend pas bien compte de qui a quoi comme donnée nous concernant. Des sociétés dont vous n&rsquo;avez jamais entendu parler se retrouvent avec vos noms, adresse, numéro de téléphone, parfois numéro de sécurité sociale&nbsp;&#8230; alors que vous n&rsquo;avez jamais donné toutes ces infos à un même site. La magie des données croisées. Il suffit d&rsquo;obtenir une base de données du service X, d&rsquo;acheter une autre d’Y, de profiter d&rsquo;un hack de la messagerie du&nbsp;réseau social Z, combiner les&nbsp;3 et pouf on un profil ultra complet. Facile ensuite de vous contacter en vous donnant une certaine impression d&rsquo;être officiel puisqu&rsquo;ils ont des infos qui sont censées être réservées à des services officiels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref si vous êtes sensible au respect de votre vie privée et/ou si vous voulez vous protéger à l&rsquo;avenir, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à jeter un oeil sur le service. Pour moins de 6€/mois, ils vont gérer tout à votre place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Découvrir Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Son nom : <a href=\"https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ChaiNNer</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChaiNNer est un outil de traitement d&rsquo;images qui utilise un fonctionnement à case de graphiques avec des noeuds et des liens entre ces noeuds, ce qui permet d&rsquo;enchainer des tâches relatives aux images. On y retrouve des fonctionnalités assez classiques de recadrage, de redimensionnement&#8230;etc., mais également des tâches infiniment plus complexes puisqu’utilisant des réseaux neuronaux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131556\" width=\"665\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot.webp 866w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot-300x260.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot-768x665.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, dans vos pipelines, vous pourrez augmenter la taille des images sans perte de qualité avec des algos de type ESRGan, ou rafraichir des photos anciennes avec des modèles de restauration de visage&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil codé en Python est disponible sur tous les OS (macOS, Windows, Linux) et supporte PyTorch, NCNN et ONNX. Une fois lancé, tout ce que vous avez à faire, c&rsquo;est de glisser / déposer des noeuds et de les connecter entre eux. Chaque poignée présente sur un noeud dispose de fonctions spécifiques selon sa couleur, ce qui permet de savoir quoi relier avec quoi. Un vrai jeu d&rsquo;enfant.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1448860395\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Et une fois que vous êtes satisfait de votre « pipe », vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à cliquer sur le bouton vert « Run » pour lancer le process.

Son nom : L&rsquo;AFG01 de  CHEFREE.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Une friteuse à air polyvalente</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je vous arrête tout de suite, rien à voir avec Xavier Niel.  <strong>L&rsquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/CHEFREE-dInt%C3%A9rieur-%C3%89lectrique-AFG01-Pr%C3%A9chauffer/dp/B0BKZNM4SC/sr_1_5?maas=maas_adg_C7D7ABCF7963E4E6C11F189EE3822130_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=amazon0d16-21&amp;__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=friteuse+sans+huile&amp;m=AYUC1COT3XCRR&amp;qid=1669964698&amp;qu=1-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AFG01</a></strong> est une friteuse à air de couleur noire mesurant précisément 42,6 cm de long sur 34,3 cm de large et de 34,7 cm de haut. Elle pèse environ 6 kg et est fabriquée en acier inoxydable ce qui lui donne une belle finition et la rend évidemment résistante à la corrosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au niveau de sa contenance, elle dispose d&rsquo;une capacité de 6 litres et est dotée d&rsquo;une puissance de 1660 watts, soit largement moins qu&rsquo;un four traditionnel</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l3x-chefree-ultenic\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est donc une friteuse à air de taille moyenne qui est assez puissante pour cuire rapidement et efficacement toutes sortes d&rsquo;aliments et pas uniquement des frites. Elle est conçue pour être utilisée en intérieur même pour vos grillades les plus extrêmes et est plutôt silencieuse, ce qui est un plus pour moi qui aime bien écouter de la musique quand je cuisine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Simplicité d&rsquo;utilisation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc eu l&rsquo;occasion de tester cet appareil de chez Ultenic depuis quelques semaines, et je dois dire que je suis vraiment content des plats que j&rsquo;ai cuisinés. Pour vous expliquer un peu mieux le truc, Ultenic est une marque qui possède une sous-marque appelée CHEFREE, spécialisée dans les appareils de cuisine comme ce grill « air fryer » AFG01.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous connaissez déjà les friteuses à air de la marque, sachez que l&rsquo;AFG01 de CHEFREE est plus polyvalente que les modèles précédents (K10 et K20). En effet, elle dispose de huit fonctions de cuisson différentes : barbecue, crisper, rôtir, cuire, griller, frire, steak et préchauffage (bon, OK ce n’est pas vraiment un mode de cuisson, mais je le compte quand même). </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132017\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132016\" width=\"578\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Autant vous dire que vous pouvez tout faire avec cet appareil, qui se comporte comme un mini four ! À titre perso, au même titre que la K10 et la K20, cet appareil me simplifie vraiment la vie tous les jours. Plus besoin d&rsquo;allumer mon four ou mes plaques de cuisson pour réchauffer un petit truc ou faire cuire une pognée de nuggets&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les accessoires inclus avec l&rsquo;AFG01 sont d&rsquo;ailleurs très utiles. Le panier à frites et la plaque de grill sont plutôt cool pour préparer des croquettes de poulet maison ou des steaks. Et j&rsquo;ai été agréablement surpris par la qualité de la cuisson notamment au niveau de la viande. Si vous dosez bien la température et le temps de cuisson, le résultat sera tendre et juteux à souhait. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132014\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Des résultats de qualité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je peux donc tout faire cuire avec cette friteuse à air qui je le rappelle a une capacité de 6 litres pour le bac, et de 4 litres pour le panier. Donc ça reste quand même un bon volume pour cuisiner pour 4 personnes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai par exemple fait des pavés de boeuf et la viande est restée saignante comme je l&rsquo;aime. Même chose avec les frites qui étaient croustillantes. Bref, on obtient le même résultat qu&rsquo;avec une friteuse à huile ou un barbecue bien chaud. Manque que l&rsquo;odeur du feu de bois&#8230; par contre, la dégoulinade d&rsquo;huile de friture ne me manque pas. Et contrairement à ce qu&rsquo;on pourrait penser, non, la viande ne se dessèche pas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132013\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Une cuisson rapide et efficace</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Grâce aux quatre niveaux de chauffage et à sa puissance de 1660 watts, vous pouvez facilement ajuster la chaleur pour cuire la viande à différents stades (saignant, moyen et bien cuit). Elle consomme également 80% d&rsquo;énergie en moins par rapport aux méthodes de cuisson traditionnelles, ce qui n&rsquo;est pas négligeable surtout en ce moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;AFG01 est également dotée d&rsquo;un système de préchauffage qui permet de régler la température en amont. Cela est très utile pour obtenir une cuisson uniforme et un meilleur « croustillant » de vos aliments. Par contre, il faudra être patient (c&rsquo;est le concept du préchauffage) et attendre quelques minutes avant de mettre les aliments dedans, mais cela en vaut vraiment la peine. Après vous pourrez retourner bidouiller sur le PC, et attendre que ça sonne.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Facile à nettoyer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le nettoyage de la CHEFREE, c&rsquo;est également très simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le revêtement anti-adhésif du bac et de la plaque de grill rend le nettoyage rapide et facile. Il suffit de rincer les pièces à l&rsquo;eau chaude et de les essuyer avec un chiffon doux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même si je ne fais pas de « conseil en investissement » (lol), je vous la recommande fortement, car pour un peu plus de 200 €,  c&rsquo;est loin d&rsquo;être un gadget. Je l&rsquo;utilise tous les jours avec sa petite soeur la K20 et je ne pourrais plus m&rsquo;en passer. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132015\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Je ne fais plus rien bruler, on mange beaucoup moins gras, je crame moins de gaz et d&rsquo;électricité, et les frites sont au top, y compris quand je les fais avec de vraies patates coupées en morceaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si j&rsquo;avais un petit bémol à apporter quand même, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;elle prend un peu de place et qu&rsquo;elle peut ne pas être adaptée à tous les espaces de rangement en raison de son couvercle qui s&rsquo;ouvre par le haut. C&rsquo;est à prendre en compte si vous avez une petite cuisine. Mais bon, à part ça c&rsquo;est vraiment top et une fois encore c&rsquo;est un appareil qui s&rsquo;appelle « friteuse à air » mais que je considère plutôt comme un mini four super efficace, paramétrable à souhait et polyvalent. Mon prochain projet avec, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;y faire cuire mon propre pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>60 euros de réduction sur l&rsquo;AFG01</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour encore plus d&rsquo;économies, profitez du code promo exclusif de 30 euros, valable jusqu&rsquo;au 24 décembre, en utilisant le code <strong>AFG01KORBEN</strong>.

L&rsquo;année arrive à sa fin et comme vous avez peut-être remarqué si vous me suivez sur <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch</a>, j&rsquo;ai commencé un petit break qui va durer jusqu&rsquo;au début janvier. Ne vous inquiétez pas, comme d&rsquo;habitude, j&rsquo;ai plein d&rsquo;articles programmés pour les jours qui viennent, donc ce sera totalement transparent pour vous 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je ne sais pas comment s&rsquo;est passé l&rsquo;année 2022 pour vous, mais pour moi, ça s&rsquo;est plutôt bien déroulé. Voici d&rsquo;ailleurs quelques « achievements » dont je suis plutôt fier. Tout d&rsquo;abord, j&rsquo;ai réussi à remettre ma coquille de noix (korben.info) sur pied malgré les difficultés économiques de l&rsquo;année dernière. Le trafic sur mon site a même plutôt augmenté, donc c&rsquo;est super cool et je retrouve beaucoup de plaisir à écrire, surtout en cette période de fêtes. C&rsquo;est donc une affaire qui roule 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mon compte <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@korbeninfo?lang=fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok</a> a également explosé, ce qui m&rsquo;offre également de nouvelles opportunités. J&rsquo;aime bien tourner ces petites vidéos et les gens ont l&rsquo;air de les apprécier, donc c&rsquo;est cool, je vais continuer. Ensuite, sur un plan personnel, j&rsquo;ai bien avancé dans les travaux à la maison. C&rsquo;est de plus en plus habitable même s&rsquo;il fait encore bien froid à l&rsquo;intérieur&#8230; Mais là, à part dépenser une fortune pour une isolation par l&rsquo;extérieur, je ne vois pas ce qui pourrait me sauver. J&rsquo;ai également obtenu mon permis tronçonneuse et j&rsquo;en suis extrêmement fier. Et enfin, je me suis enfin marié après avoir dû décaler la cérémonie de 2 ans à cause du Covid. Woohoo !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour 2022. C&rsquo;était cool et pour cette année 2023 qui arrive, je n&rsquo;ai pas spécialement d&rsquo;ambitions autres que de continuer sur ma lancée, c&rsquo;est-à-dire de faire plaisir aux <a href=\"https://patreon.com/korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreons</a> et de continuer à partager avec vous toutes mes découvertes tech au fil de l&rsquo;eau. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et vous, comment ça s&rsquo;est passé ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A très bientôt ! Et passez de bonnes fêtes de fin d&rsquo;année 🍾  !</p>\n",

Il y a les développeurs qu&rsquo;il faut chouchouter évidemment, mais également les designers et les gens du marketing afin que le « produit » qui est porté par votre entreprise rencontre un franc succès. Sacrée mission, et tout ça sans jamais perdre votre sourire ni votre sens de l&rsquo;humour !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pas simple 🙂</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/rr-talent-product-manager-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce métier de product manager est encore assez récent en France, mais a su se rendre indispensable dans de nombreuses entreprises Tech. Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, le rôle d&rsquo;un product manager est donc de faire correspondre les besoins des utilisateurs avec les attentes de la société qui l&#8217;emploie afin de créer un modèle économique pérenne. Le product manager doit donc garder un oeil sur la faisabilité technique du projet, sa facilité d&rsquo;utilisation et sa valeur en termes de business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cet article a été rédigé en partenariat avec&nbsp;<a href=\"https://me.korben.info/pbh-talentio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io</a>. Si ce genre de sujet vous intéresse, vous pouvez rejoindre leur communauté tech, le talent club. En vous inscrivant gratuitement, vous aurez accès à du contenu exclusif, comme des conseils d’experts qui travaillent chez Google, Deezer, Sorare&#8230; Vous aurez également accès à leur étude des salaires annuelle, ainsi que la possibilité de poser vos questions carrière à l’ensemble des 40 000 membre de manière anonyme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rejoignez la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/talent-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"429\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, la réussite d&rsquo;un projet se mesure sur l&rsquo;impact généré par le produit et non plus bêtement sur « Est-ce que ça a été livré ? ». On s&rsquo;éloigne donc d&rsquo;une mesure bête et méchante comme une « quantité de features » sorties pour plutôt mesurer si l&rsquo;application (ou l&rsquo;objet) a été un succès en matière d&rsquo;utilisateurs ou d&rsquo;acheteurs. C&rsquo;est beaucoup plus pragmatique comme approche et ça permet par la suite de prendre des décisions beaucoup plus éclairées sur les améliorations à apporter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, un produit réussi c&rsquo;est un produit qu&rsquo;on peut faire techniquement (ce n’est pas un scoop), qui sera utilisé régulièrement par les utilisateurs et enfin, c&rsquo;est un produit qui rapporte de l&rsquo;argent ou un fort gain de temps ou d&rsquo;efficacité. Si votre produit ne remplit pas ces objectifs, il vous faut un product manager, alors pourquoi pas vous ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alors en tant que dev, quelles sont les raisons principales de quitter son job de codeur pour devenir product manager ?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Déjà, ça peut paraitre idiot dit comme ça, mais vous aurez beaucoup plus d&rsquo;influence sur le projet. Avec votre vue d&rsquo;ensemble, vous déciderez des priorités et des objectifs à atteindre et c&rsquo;est vous qui mènerez le projet à son succès (ou à sa perte ^^).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le métier de product manager est également beaucoup plus varié. En tant que développeur, vous vous concentrez essentiellement sur des problématiques techniques, allant jusqu&rsquo;à compter les accolades dans votre code. Le product manager, avec une casquette technique, a l&rsquo;opportunité de travailler sur des problématiques plus larges qui vont bien au-delà du code. Cela peut être des aspects plus stratégiques comme la commercialisation, la capitalisation des retours utilisateurs, l&rsquo;amélioration du design&#8230;etc. C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;un certain point de vue, beaucoup plus enrichissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, devenir product manager ça veut aussi dire faire le lien entre toutes les équipes. Développeurs, designers, marketeux, data scientist, c&rsquo;est vous qui donnez le « la » et qui êtes le chef d&rsquo;orchestre de tout ce petit monde. Donc forcément, dans ce job, vous apprendrez énormément au contact des autres, à la fois techniquement et humainement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, tout n&rsquo;est pas tout rose et il y a de nombreux défis à relever quand on passe de dev à product manager. Vous serez responsable des enjeux commerciaux donc ce sera à vous de prendre les bonnes décisions pour que le produit « fonctionne » et rapporte à l&rsquo;entreprise. Vous devrez également gérer les conflits et les différences de points de vue entre les équipes et les personnes. Et vous devrez sans cesse décider de tout&#8230; Faire des choix sur la stratégie, sur la technique, sur les équipes&#8230; etc. Ces choix auront des impacts que vous devrez assumer. Bref, Product Manager, c&rsquo;est aussi savoir prendre des décisions difficiles.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131855\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si en sachant tout cela, ça vous botte encore, sachez qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas spécifiquement de formation pour passer de développeur à product manager. Vous devez être capable de comprendre les responsabilités, les compétences et les enjeux du métier. Vous devez être un excellent communiquant et surtout être très organisé avec une forte résilience / adaptabilité et une grande capacité d&rsquo;apprentissage, car ça va fuser dans tous les sens, je vous le promets ^^. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à trouver des mentors dans ce domaine et de bouquiner des livres sur le sujet, mais également de vous intéresser à tous les aspects du produit sur lequel vous travaillez. L&rsquo;objectif c&rsquo;est de montrer au sein de votre entreprise que vous êtes capable de travailler sur une mission de product management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez également renforcer ou travailler certaines compétences, sur lesquelles vous vous sentez plus fragiles comme la communication, la gestion de projet, la compréhension des enjeux commerciaux, etc. Il existe des formations et des tas de livres sur le leadership, l&#8217;empathie au travail et la communication. Vous pourrez ainsi rapidement mettre en oeuvre vos compétences sur des projets concrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si votre reconversion est dans un cadre de changement d&rsquo;entreprise, pensez à mettre en avant vos compétences de développeur dans votre candidature, pour montrer que vous avez les bases techniques pour rejoindre l&rsquo;entreprise comme product manager, tout en soulignant votre expérience de travail en équipe, vos capacités à résoudre des problèmes complexes et votre intérêt pour les enjeux commerciaux. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas, l&rsquo;objectif c&rsquo;est de convaincre un employeur potentiel que vous saurez lui apporter de la valeur en tant que product manager. Beaucoup plus que si vous étiez resté développeur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En conclusion, passer de développeur à product manager c&rsquo;est comme passer d&rsquo;un sport individuel à un sport d&rsquo;équipe : c&rsquo;est passionnant, stimulant et ça bouge tout le temps ! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, si vous avez envie d&rsquo;avoir une vue d&rsquo;ensemble sur un projet, de travailler vraiment en équipe et de prendre des décisions importantes, le job de product manager est probablement un métier qui vous conviendra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prêt à quitter le code pour devenir le prochain Didier Deschamps du numérique ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour plus de conseils sur votre carrière, vous pouvez rejoindre <a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">le talent club</a>.

Cela vous permettra ainsi de retirer, convertir ou extraire les pistes audio de vos vidéos, ou encore de créer des GIFs animés à partir de celles-ci. Vous pourrez également intégrer en dur les sous-titres sur une vidéo ou réparer / stabiliser une vidéo et j&rsquo;en passe.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"984\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131453\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m.webp 984w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m-300x229.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m-768x585.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref, très cool surtout que vous pouvez créer également vos propres presets en utilisant les paramètres de FFMpeg (mais là, faudra bosser un peu plus la documentation).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-530193462\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Tout ce qui est conversion est également très simple avec Videomass.

Enfin, seulement si vous êtes sous Mac, car <a href=\"http://numi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Numi</strong></a> ne fonctionne que sur cet OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numi est une calculatrice (en beta) d&rsquo;un nouveau genre qui permet de faire des calculs normaux, de la conversion d&rsquo;unités, du calcul de pourcentage, du calcul de fonctions&#8230;etc.,etc. au travers d&rsquo;une interface minimaliste et simple au possible. Elle permet ainsi de décrire des tâches de manière naturelle et d&rsquo;obtenir instantanément une réponse précise. Par exemple, « 20 $ en euros &#8211; remise de 5 % » ou « aujourd&rsquo;hui + 2 semaines ».</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131895\" width=\"374\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb.webp 746w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb-298x300.webp 298w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Voici quelques unes de ses possibilités : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conversion d&rsquo;unités</strong> : permet de convertir une unité en une autre en utilisant les mots-clés « in », « into », « as » ou « to ». Numi convertira automatiquement les unités pour effectuer les opérations si cela est nécessaire lors de la conversion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Conversion de fuseau horaire</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser la fonction « time » ou « now » pour obtenir l&rsquo;heure dans votre fuseau horaire. Vous pouvez préfixer ces fonctions avec le nom du fuseau horaire (ou utiliser « in » avec un suffixe de fuseau horaire) pour obtenir l&rsquo;heure actuelle pour un lieu spécifié. Les résultats sont toujours synchronisés avec l&rsquo;heure mondiale, donc en tout temps vous obtiendrez l&rsquo;heure exacte. Il est également possible de convertir une heure ou une date spécifique d&rsquo;un fuseau horaire à un autre. Ou calculez la différence entre les heures dans différents fuseaux horaires.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Opérations</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser des opérateurs en signe et en mot. Plusieurs expressions peuvent être empilées ensemble. Notez que les expressions seront multipliées si elles sont utilisées dans des parenthèses les unes après les autres.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nombres</strong> : en plus du système numérique décimal, il est possible d&rsquo;utiliser des nombres en binaire, en octal ou en hexadécimal en utilisant le préfixe approprié : 0b, 0o et 0x. Vous pouvez utiliser les mots-clés « sci » ou « scientific » pour formater les résultats en notation scientifique.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Devises</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser les codes ISO 4217 pour les devises (comme USD, RUB, CAD, etc.). Vous pouvez également utiliser les noms et les symboles des devises courantes, comme le $ pour les dollars américains, les roubles pour les roubles russes ou € pour l&rsquo;euro. Numi met à jour les taux de change plusieurs fois par jour en utilisant le service de taux de change ouvert. Numi prend également en charge une grande liste de cryptomonnaies avec des mises à jour horaires des taux.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pourcentages</strong> : en plus des opérations de pourcentage générales comme l&rsquo;ajout ou la soustraction d&rsquo;un pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur ($10 &#8211; 40%), vous pouvez également utiliser des opérations supplémentaires : pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur, ajout de pourcentage, soustraction de pourcentage, pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre, ajout de pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre, soustraction de pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fonctions</strong> : Numi supporte une large gamme de fonctions mathématiques courantes, y compris les fonctions trigonométriques, exponentielles et logarithmiques. Vous pouvez également utiliser des fonctions d&rsquo;arrondi, de pourboire et de pourcentage de gain/perte.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>En utilisant ces fonctionnalités, Numi vous permet de simplifier vos calculs et de les effectuer rapidement et facilement sur votre Mac. Essayez-la dès maintenant pour voir à quel point elle est rapide, jolie et bien plus agréable que ceci :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img width=\"478\" height=\"315\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2015/07/alc.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1253804088\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p><em>Article rédigé le 6 juillet 2015 et mis à jour le 15 décembre 2022.</em></p>\n",

Moins de 55€ (+TVA)&nbsp;pour 26 mois de protection, et cela <strong>sur un nombre illimité d&rsquo;appareils</strong> ! Difficile de faire mieux, pas encore d&rsquo;inflation chez Surfshark 😉 Et comme toujours vous pouvez encore&nbsp;ajouter une couche de sécu supplémentaire&nbsp;avec le combo alertes +&nbsp;moteur de recherche + l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Antivirus Surfshark</a> (39€ pour les 26 semaines).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"87\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8ik-surfsharknoel\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est le VPN que j&rsquo;utilise personnellement et ce que j&rsquo;apprécie c&rsquo;est que depuis leur lancement (en 2018) ils évoluent sans cesse et plutôt vite. Il y a un mois c&rsquo;était le lancement de <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-nexus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-nexus.html\">Surfshark Nexus</a> par exemple, une fonctionnalité qui permet de stabiliser et améliorer la qualité de sa connexion. En ce mois de décembre, c&rsquo;est au tour du service CleanWeb de subir une refonte et de passer au niveau supérieur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour rappel, l&rsquo;option CleanWeb de base permet de bloquer les publicités et de vous protéger contre les malwares et autres tentatives de phishing. Avec la nouvelle&nbsp;mouture 2.0 les possibilités sont bien supérieures.&nbsp;Cette version n&rsquo;est pour l&rsquo;instant&nbsp;disponible&nbsp;que&nbsp;via&nbsp;les extensions pour navigateurs Firefox, Chrome&nbsp;et Edge. Donc sur Firefox. Les autres n&rsquo;existant pas (bouh j&rsquo;ai fais un troll sur mon site&nbsp;:p).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"320\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/9zgsLDswv632U/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>j&rsquo;en ai fait 2 du coup</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Les options de <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleanWeb 2.0</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Outre une nouvelle version du moteur de blocage des publicités,&nbsp;elle dispose d&rsquo;une personnalisation et d&rsquo;un affinage des blocages pour chacun&nbsp;site visité,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;Cet affinage se fait sur 4 aspects (tous activés par défaut, mais&nbsp;modulable dans les paramètres)&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>le <strong>bloqueur de pubs</strong> : ne se limite plus seulement&nbsp;aux différentes bannières texte/image, il prend aussi en compte les encarts présents dans les vidéos ou sur les plateformes de streaming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>le <strong>bloqueur de pop-up</strong> : va bloquer les ouvertures de fenêtres pop-up, incluant notamment les cookies de consentement/RGPD, etc. Par défaut il va les refuser automatiquement si c&rsquo;est possible, sinon accepter uniquement&nbsp;les cookies&nbsp;obligatoires.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>les <strong>alertes malwares</strong> : vous prévient en cas de téléchargement&nbsp;risqué ou d&rsquo;activité suspicieuse de la page sur laquelle vous êtes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>les <strong>alertes de fuite de données</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131803\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2.jpg 700w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ces dernières sont vraiment intéressantes. Cela vous permet de savoir si les sites que vous visitez ont déjà eu&nbsp;des soucis par le passé. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, il vous fournit un tas d&rsquo;informations :&nbsp;à quelle date,&nbsp;de quelle nature, le nombre de comptes concernés, etc. Pratique, car si l&rsquo;un de ces sites&nbsp;à déjà plusieurs fuites&nbsp;à son actif, peut-être que cela vous fera réfléchir avant d&rsquo;y laisser vos données personnelles. Ou bien la passoire qu&rsquo;il semble être sera tellement énorme que vous bannirez ce site à vie par peur (<em>#coucouFacebook</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez aussi vous servir de ces informations comme d&rsquo;un système de surveillance personnalisé. Si un service que vous utilisez se fait hacker sans que vous soyez au courant, vous verrez une alerte apparaitre dès que Surfshark aura vent du problème. Cela vous amènera sans doute à modifier votre mot de passe au plus vite.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"210\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/EGe7H8HTtw3Cg/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Du coup <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark</a> a décidé de lui donner une vraie place dans son interface avec&nbsp;une section dédiée sur&nbsp;le tableau de bord (c&rsquo;était inclus dans la section VPN auparavant). D&rsquo;ailleurs je le précise pour ceux qui se poseraient la question : <strong>CleanWeb fonctionne même sans être connecté au VPN</strong>, donc en permanence tant que vous utilisez&nbsp;votre navigateur (et que l&rsquo;extension est active, Captain Obvious represent).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore une bonne raison de plus pour se tourner vers Surfshark VPN !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;en profite pour vous rappeler que si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas très chaud pour payer par carte bancaire ou Paypal, le site propose aussi les paiements Google Pay/Amazon Pay et même celui&nbsp;en cryptomonnaies (via les fournisseurs CoinGate et CoinPayments).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Profitez de l&rsquo;offre hivernale à -84% + 2 mois gratuit</a></h2>\n",

Génial non ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous faites partie des dernières 5 personnes au monde à mettre des watermarks sur la photo, c&rsquo;est également possible.

Et cela est possible grâce au script WebOSINT qui une fois en place sur votre machine, ira collecter toutes ces informations, soit directement, soit en utilisant certains services tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour que tout fonctionne correctement avec <a href=\"https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/WebOSINT/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WebOSINT</a>, vous devrez donc vous créer des comptes sur différents services afin de récupérer les clés API. Les clés seront à renseigner dans le fichier config.json.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant l&rsquo;API HackerTarget, pas d&rsquo;obligation puisque vous pouvez utiliser l&rsquo;offre gratuite limitée à quelques requêtes en utilisant l&rsquo;option « -F ». Concernant l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">API WhoisXML</a> ou <a href=\"https://whoisfreaks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhoisFreaks</a>, il vous faudra par contre créer un compte, mais rassurez vous, c&rsquo;est gratuit dans une certaine limite. WhoisXML se limite gratuitement à 500 recherches et WhoisFreaks à 100 recherches gratuites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour installer WebOSINT, ouvrez un terminal et entrez les commandes suivantes : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/webosint\ncd webosint\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\npython3 webosint.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1584905815\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Pensez à bien renseigner les clés API dans le fichier config.json. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois l&rsquo;outil lancé, vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à entrer le nom de domaine et laisser faire la magie de WebOSINT.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131317\" width=\"662\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i.webp 840w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i-300x268.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i-768x686.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Merci à Deuza, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soutien Patreon de renom</a>, pour la découverte.</p>\n",

Elle a sorti un livre d&rsquo;énigmes, il y a quelque temps, en collaboration avec son co-auteur Taharn, intitulé « La Clef » et j&rsquo;avais envie de vous le faire découvrir.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131820\" width=\"610\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8-300x195.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8-768x499.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est un livre unique en son genre (sérieux il n&rsquo;y a pas d&rsquo;équivalent !), qui combine une histoire passionnante et des énigmes complexes à résoudre grâce, notamment, à l&rsquo;utilisation d&rsquo;une lampe UV comme dans les Experts ^^.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai eu la chance de « tester » ce livre et j&rsquo;ai vraiment été impressionnée par la qualité des illustrations qui m&rsquo;ont plongé dans l&rsquo;univers fantastique imaginé par Fanélia, ainsi que par l&rsquo;originalité des énigmes proposées. Enfin, je dis « originalité », mais on encore au-delà de ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le livre s&rsquo;appelle « La Clef » et c&rsquo;est un ouvrage assez costaud, avec une couverture rigide et un papier d’une grande qualité, ce qui le classe dans la catégorie des livres de collection. Offrez-le à un(e) ami(e) geek et il ou elle vous aimera pour la vie ^^. Chaque double page du livre propose ainsi une énigme à résoudre, sans énoncé explicite. Oui, j&rsquo;ai bien dit « sans énoncé », ce qui peut, je vous l’avoue être assez perturbant.&nbsp;En tout cas, moi ça me perturbe ^^.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131815\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Le lecteur devra donc utiliser son sens de l’observation digne d&rsquo;un aigle et sa logique implacable pour trouver la solution en se basant évidemment sur le texte et l&rsquo;image. Le livre comporte 75 énigmes en tout, et certaines d&rsquo;entre elles font référence à d&rsquo;autres pages du livre ou <a href=\"https://www.laclef.online/concept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">même à des sites internet</a>.&nbsp;Vous imaginez le délire ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un Discord est également disponible pour ceux qui souhaitent discuter des énigmes avec d&rsquo;autres lecteurs et avoir un petit coup de pouce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;un des aspects les plus intéressants du livre « La Clef », c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;encre invisible. En utilisant la lampe UV fournie avec le livre, le lecteur peut ainsi découvrir des éléments cachés présents sur certaines pages. Ces indices viennent enrichir l&rsquo;énigme et ajoutent un niveau à la complexité et à l&rsquo;originalité des énigmes. Je vous promets que ça rend l&rsquo;expérience de lecture encore plus immersive et divertissante.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131816\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131817\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Concernant l’univers du livre, je vais tenter de vous résumer ce que j’en ai compris. Ça se passe à Astolie, un monde imaginaire dans un style purement Dark Fantasy et le lecteur peut comme ça, découvrir les différents aspects de la mythologie et de la culture d&rsquo;Astolie en résolvant les énigmes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque énigme est plus originale que la précédente, et certaines font même référence à d&rsquo;autres oeuvres de la littérature, du cinéma ou des jeux vidéo. Cela permet aux fans d&rsquo;énigmes de retrouver des références qu&rsquo;ils connaissent bien, tout en découvrant le nouvel univers tout droit sorti de la tête de nos auteurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je l’ai déjà dit, mais les énigmes sont assez complexes, et elles ne sont pas vraiment destinées aux débutants. Ce n’est pas un livre d’énigmes bas de gamme pour s&rsquo;occuper à la plage comme on peut en trouver parfois… Non, non, elles nécessitent une réflexion approfondie et une capacité à associer des éléments divers et variés pour trouver la solution. Cela en fait le livre parfait pour les amateurs d&rsquo;énigmes expérimentés ou les gens à l&rsquo;esprit acéré, cherchant un défi stimulant et original. Je sais, chacun d&rsquo;entre nous pense qu&rsquo;il a l&rsquo;esprit vif et qu&rsquo;il est plus malin que son voisin&#8230; Je vous rassure, ce livre vous aidera à voir la réalité en face, et ça va faire mal ^^.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131818\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Mon retour sur le bouquin, c’est que je l’adore, mais, la vache, je galère. C’est plus dur qu’un challenge de hacking 😉 en tout cas, je suis loin de l’avoir fini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les fans d&rsquo;univers fantastique ou de Fantasy apprécieront également la qualité des illustrations et l&rsquo;ambiance immersive créée par Fanelia. D’ailleurs, si vous appréciez ses dessins, sachez qu&rsquo;elle vend également ses oeuvres sur son site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour conclure, je dirais que « La Clef » est un bouquin original et passionnant qui mérite d&rsquo;être lu par les amateurs d&rsquo;énigmes et d&rsquo;univers fantastiques n’ayant pas peur de se prendre un peu la tête. Tout est qualitatif dans ce livre et les énigmes + l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;encre invisible, en font un livre à la fois beau et stimulant pour notre petit cerveau tout mou. Ça change !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La complexité des énigmes et la richesse de l&rsquo;univers d&rsquo;Astolie en feront un cadeau idéal pour vos amis ou votre famille, en particulier à l&rsquo;approche de Noël.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131814\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes intéressé, vous pouvez <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BeZiYk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>le commander en ligne</strong></a> ou le trouver dans une librairie spécialisée ou directement <strong><a href=\"https://www.fanelia.art/22-la-clef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sur le site de Fanéli</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.fanelia.art/22-la-clef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>a</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore merci à Fanelia de m’avoir fait découvrir Astolie !</p>\n",

Bref tous ceux qui vendent ou utilisent de la publicité personnalisée. Et malheureusement ces infos finissent toujours par fuiter ou être revendues. GAFAM, application mobile&nbsp;ou petit site e-commerce,&nbsp;pas une semaine ne passe sans que&nbsp;l&rsquo;un de ces&nbsp;services subisse un leak ou un piratage quelconque. Certains sont même créées quasiment juste pour cela, par exemple des applis spéciales pour profiter des offres du Black Friday qui revendent vos données une fois la période terminée.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"426\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/19u-incogni3\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Dans 91.24% des cas (estimation personnelle scientifiquement validée et basée sur mon flair digne de Rantanplan), cela se fait à votre insu. Vous recevez parfois un mail ou un SMS louche pour lequel vous vous demandez comment les gens ont eu vos coordonnées, mais le plus souvent c&rsquo;est flou ou vous l&rsquo;acceptez comme allant de soi. Quoi de plus normal que la publicité ciblée et basée sur nos préférences ? Vous commencez dans les cryptos et n&rsquo;avez encore jamais interagi avec ces services ? Combien de temps avant de recevoir des mails de phishing Metamask &amp; Co ? Pas très longtemps dans la plupart des cas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dès que votre mail, votre numéro de téléphone, votre nom&nbsp;&#8230; est&nbsp;lié à un&nbsp;centre d&rsquo;intérêt particulier vous êtes foutu, ça va tourner dans des dizaines de bases de données chez les data brokers. Vous devez alors leur demander de les retirer. Selon les pays ils sont parfois légalement tenus de le faire, mais même dans ce cas ils traineront des pieds au maximum, car c&rsquo;est leur gagne-pain. Et il faut déjà commencer par les identifier, ce qui n&rsquo;est pas&nbsp;souvent simple à faire. Bonjour les maux de tête.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YpmVBNubONoqs/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"224\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là</a> pour faire le travail à votre place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En utilisant le service, vous allez commencer par lui renseigner les différentes informations que vous voulez faire retirer d&rsquo;Internet. Ensuite Incogni prend tout en charge. Ils vont analyser en continu qui sont les data brokers possédant vos infos et leur demander de les effacer. Pour l&rsquo;instant plus de 145 brokers sont surveillés et la liste s&rsquo;allonge chaque mois (ils n&rsquo;en suivaient que 76 au lancement du produit il y a quelques mois). Si ces derniers ne répondent pas, ils vont les relancer sans arrêt et augmenter la pression jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Et même lorsque c&rsquo;est retiré ils vont continuer à surveiller que cela reste bien le cas. Un peu comme si vous vous mettiez sur liste rouge du web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incogni annonce sauver environ 300 heures de travail. J&rsquo;imagine que c&rsquo;est dans le cas où vous seriez présent sur tous les data brokers qu&rsquo;ils surveillent et je ne peux pas vérifier cette info, mais quand même. Cela en fait du temps gagné et vous suivrez l&rsquo;évolution de la situation via un tableau de bord régulièrement mis à jour. Vous pouvez y voir le nom des sociétés qui détiennent vos informations, ce qu&rsquo;elles en font,&nbsp;où en est la procédure de suppression et parfois à qui elles communiquent leurs données. Voir <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">mon test d&rsquo;Incogni</a> si vous voulez voir à quoi ça ressemble.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En résumé Incogni agit comme un intermédiaire. Ce n&rsquo;est pas qu&rsquo;ils font quelque chose que vous ne pourriez faire vous-mêmes, ils sont plutôt là pour vous faire gagner du temps et que vous n&rsquo;ayez pas à recommencer le travail tous les x mois. Comparé à d&rsquo;autres outils du même genre les tarifs sont plutôt bas puisqu&rsquo;ils sont de l&rsquo;ordre de moins de 5.8€/mois sur l&rsquo;abonnement à l&rsquo;année.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Et puisque ce sont bientôt les fêtes, voici déjà un bon plan qui pourrait vous faire plaisir.&nbsp;Profitez d&rsquo;une<strong> offre à -60 % sur l’abonnement d’un an à Incogni</strong> en ajoutant le code INCOGNI60 lors de votre commande !! Vous avez jusqu&rsquo;au 4 décembre&nbsp;alors ne tardez pas&nbsp;!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez comme plan de disparaitre virtuellement bientôt, c&rsquo;est peut-être un outil qui vous rendra quelques services 😉 Enfin si vous habitez en Europe (inclus l&rsquo;Angleterre), aux USA, en Suisse&nbsp;ou&nbsp;au Canada. Pour les autres pays, ce n&rsquo;est pas encore pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni, efface-moi d&rsquo;Internet stp !</a></h2>\n",

Cela vous permettra de communiquer rapidement et facilement avec vos collaborateurs, vos clients et même les internautes de passage sur votre site web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Très pratique si vous êtes une startup ou une PME qui met à disposition un numéro de téléphone ou qui dispose d&rsquo;un webchat sur son site web pour répondre à toutes les demandes de ses clients. Je pense notamment à tous les e-commerçants ou les startups naissantes qui n&rsquo;ont pas encore les moyens des grosses entreprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est pour cela que 3CX propose une solution de standard téléphonique et de plateforme de messagerie gérée par leurs soins et dans certains cas, hébergée sur vos propres serveurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8874b5-3CX\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"300\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>L&rsquo;offre StartUP Free</strong></a> est donc un bon moyen de découvrir les possibilités de la plateforme de 3CX sans débourser un centime.

Vous accueillez vos clients comme il se doit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, de quoi gérer votre propre petit standard téléphonique gratuitement et surtout facilement, car l&rsquo;interface est vraiment très propre et très claire.

Cela vous permettra d&rsquo;avoir un suivi des conversations avec votre clientèle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque membre du groupe peut également paramétrer ses heures de présence pour que le standard sache où et quand renvoyer les appels. C&rsquo;est plutôt génial d&rsquo;avoir un outil totalement VoIP comme celui-ci qui peut être parfaitement utilisé par les gens en télétravail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>3CX a vraiment fait du très bon travail. Comme je le disais, l&rsquo;outil est simple à prendre en main, même pour le néophyte et chacun peut alors bénéficier d&rsquo;un standard VoIP gratuitement. Les visioconférences et les appels téléphoniques sont parfaitement fluides et d&rsquo;un bon niveau de qualité, mais surtout, ce qui fait la force de 3CX c&rsquo;est vraiment l&rsquo;implémentation de ces technologies (VoIP / WebRTC) dans une suite qui offre toutes les fonctionnalités nécessaires aux petites, moyennes et grandes entreprises qui ont des besoins de communication clientèle. De plus, les fonctionnalités de messagerie que ce soit via WhatsApp ou Livechat, en intégration sur un site web, sont idéales pour recueillir les échanges clients en réduisant les temps d&rsquo;attente et les temps d&rsquo;échange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, c&rsquo;est vraiment un outil à essayer si vous avez besoin de mettre en place un live chat ou un standard téléphonique. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pour vous inscrire, c&rsquo;est par ici</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous avez besoin de documentation, <a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/docs/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">celle-ci se trouve ici</a>.</p>\n",

Seulement voilà, malgré tout l&rsquo;amour que vous portez à Firefox, vous restez quand même conscient que parfois, il peut bouffer un peu *trop* de mémoire.

Alors c&rsquo;est vrai que Windows sait également nettoyer la mémoire, mais il ne le fait pas aussi souvent que Firmin qui lui veille particulièrement sur Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois Firemin lancé, vous choisissez une fréquence de « nettoyage » en millisecondes (par défaut c&rsquo;est 1000 ms), mais les développeurs de Firemin indiquent que les résultats seront meilleurs avec 500 ms. Vous pouvez également spécifier une quantité de mémoire propre à Firefox, à ne pas dépasser (ici 100 MB).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131157\" width=\"433\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp 655w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2-256x300.webp 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Là où c&rsquo;est sympa, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez lui indiquer d&rsquo;autres navigateurs (Chrome, Brave, Edge&#8230;etc.) en cliquant simplement sur le bouton « Parcourir ». J&rsquo;imagine que ça peut fonctionner également avec d&rsquo;autres applications qui ne sont pas des navigateurs, donc à essayer sur vos applications consommatrices de mémoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil doit être lancé en même temps que le navigateur pour fonctionner, donc pensez bien à cocher la case « Démarrer Firemin quand Windows démarre » pour ensuite l&rsquo;oublier.

Mais il y a aussi la stabilité de votre ligne ADSL, de votre Fibre ou de votre connexion 4G/5G qui est importante. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une connexion avec beaucoup de bande passante, c&rsquo;est cool pour regarder une vidéo en ligne ou télécharger un fichier, mais pour des activités moins gourmandes comme la visioconférence ou les jeux vidéos, ce qui compte surtout c&rsquo;est que les réponses à vos requêtes soient rapides et fiables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vos requêtes ne parviennent pas à leur destination, les paquets sont alors perdus et cela peut dégrader votre expérience de jeu par exemple. Sur du FPS, pour être bien il faudrait que le ping soit à minima bien en dessous des 60ms et qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait aucun paquet perdu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même chose pour les visioconférences ou la VoIP, vous devez avoir quelque chose de bon niveau ping et une certaine régularité dans l&rsquo;arrivée de vos paquets TCP pour que la discussion reste compréhensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-991969282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors, comment évaluer ça ? Et bien rendez-vous sur le site <a href=\"https://packetlosstest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Packet Loss Test</a> pour mesurer la fiabilité de votre connexion, et déterminer à la fois la latence, mais également le pourcentage de paquets perdus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131060\" width=\"717\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-300x170.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-768x435.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>De mon côté, je suis plutôt pas mal. Si de votre côté, vous avez beaucoup de paquets perdus, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcément la faute de votre FAI. Jouez avec les réglages du site pour adapter le test à votre bande passante maximale.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"617\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp 617w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw-241x300.webp 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si ça ne change rien, il est fort probable que vous ayez sur votre réseau local, un routeur ou une carte réseau qui se comporte mal. Il faudra alors jouer au jeu du « <em>Je te débranche, je re-teste et je vois si ça va mieux</em>« .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, si rien ne cloche, un petit coup de fil au fournisseur d&rsquo;accès internet. Bon courage avec cette dernière étape.</p>\n",

Ou en français, un courtier en données ?&nbsp;Pas vraiment&nbsp;? Pourtant je suis presque certain que vous en avez forcément rencontré un dans votre vie sur Internet, voire plusieurs. Ils pullulent tellement qu&rsquo;il&nbsp;est aujourd&rsquo;hui presque impossible de conserver son existence en ligne pour soi. Vos informations sont récupérées et exploitées chez eux.&nbsp;Malheureusement, malgré les dangers qu&rsquo;ils représentent pour les gens, physiquement et virtuellement, tout le monde ne les connait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un courtier en données est un <s>parasite</s> organisme qui récolte des informations personnelles sur le maximum d&rsquo;internautes. Ils compilent leurs différentes sources pour créer un profil plus ou moins précis de vous en recoupant ce qu&rsquo;ils trouvent. Cela va de votre email, à votre adresse, vos noms et prénoms, vos possessions, vos informations légales&nbsp;&#8230; voir vos habitudes d&rsquo;achat et votre historique web.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"368\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/xcj-incogni2\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Où vont-ils chercher ces données ? Et bien déjà de tout ce qui est public par défaut (infos perso lorsque vous créez une société &#8230;) ou partagé publiquement par vous-mêmes (réseaux sociaux &#8230;). Ensuite parce que certains services peu scrupuleux&nbsp;sur lesquels vous vous inscrivez n&rsquo;hésitent pas à les&nbsp;revendre (par exemple votre numéro de carte bancaire que vous avez&nbsp;inséré dans un jeu mobile). Plus de 40% des extensions Chrome sont classées comme <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" target=\"_blank\">étant à risque</a>. Enfin&nbsp;depuis des bases de données, des listes de clients, etc. volées, leakées ou revendues par divers hackeurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois qu&rsquo;ils ont recoupé et centralisé toutes leurs sources, ils vont établir des profils thématisés&nbsp;et revendre à leur tour ces informations à des entités commerciales. Vous venez de divorcer ? Vous allez subitement recevoir de la pub en rapport.&nbsp;Une partie des spams que vous recevez dans votre boite mail, ce sont eux. Des SMS non sollicités ? Encore eux. Des coups de fil intempestifs ? Toujours eux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xdnytp8742kg0/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Non seulement c&rsquo;est pénible, mais en plus&nbsp;cela peut être dangereux. Certains sites web centralisent les infos et n&rsquo;hésitent pas à&nbsp;les rendre accessibles à tous. Il suffit alors d&rsquo;une recherche sur votre nom pour connaitre éventuellement votre adresse physique, l&rsquo;endroit ou vous travaillez, quelle voiture vous conduisez, si vous possédez une assurance vie ou non, qui sont les membres de votre famille, etc.&nbsp;Heureusement pour cet aspect « porte ouverte au grand&nbsp;public »&nbsp;nous avons certaines protections en France, <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">notamment le RGPD</a>. Mais aux USA il y a des sites comme PeekYou, WhitePages, etc. qui les partagent. Et c&rsquo;est flippant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du coup l&rsquo;idéal c&rsquo;est de faire supprimer tout ce qui permet de vous identifier chez ces data brokers. Mais comment faire ? Comment identifier ces courtiers ? Et comment savoir qu&rsquo;un courtier détient vos infos ? Enfin, comment lui faire supprimer&nbsp;ce qu&rsquo;il possède sur vous&nbsp;?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"incogni Dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-131464\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-300x100.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ne vous cassez plus le cerveau, <a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là pour vous faciliter la vie</a>. Pour quelques euros par mois, le service de Surfshark va scanner tout le web pour :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>retrouver&nbsp;les brokers qui disposent de vos&nbsp;infos personnelles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>contacter&nbsp;ces courtiers&nbsp;pour leur demander de les supprimer (ce qui est votre droit)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>relancer ces derniers s&rsquo;ils ne se bougent pas assez vite</li>\n\n\n\n<li>effectuer un suivit au fil du temps pour s&rsquo;assurer que vos infos ne sont pas remises en ligne</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Et comme Incogni augmente sans cesse sa liste de brokers sous surveillance, plus le temps passe et plus votre protection augmente. Je vous ai fait un<a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\"> test du service complet </a>il y a quelques semaines, j&rsquo;avais été plutôt étonné de voir le nombre de courtiers qui m&rsquo;avaient sous la main (quasi 100 !). Au moins, filez-moi un billet pour exploiter mes données bande de crevards. Surtout au vu des prix auxquels elles se revendent parfois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6u1Z9pUakUHG6o7oiV/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"303\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref avec Incogni vous allez économiser pas mal de temps, de maux de tête et d&rsquo;énervement lorsque les data brokers ignorerons vos mails. Non, mais qui êtes-vous pour leur retirer le pain de la bouche aussi ? L&rsquo;autre gros avantage du service est de vous présenter un suivit via un tableau de bord très simple à prendre en main. Vous&nbsp;verrez combien de brokers ont vos infos et suivrez en temps réel l&rsquo;avancée du&nbsp;retrait de vos données.&nbsp;Ainsi que&nbsp;le travail de sape d&rsquo;Incogni pour les relancer sans cesse jusqu&rsquo;à ce qu&rsquo;ils obtempèrent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une corde de plus à l&rsquo;arc du respect de la vie privée sur Internet. C&rsquo;est toujours bon à prendre.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Commencez la saison des fêtes avec un peu plus&nbsp;de tranquillité d&rsquo;esprit ! Protégez vos données personnelles&nbsp;et profitez d&rsquo;une réduction de 60 % sur l&rsquo;abonnement d&rsquo;un an à Incogni.

Si vous ne connaissez pas le concept de Serverless, et bien ça va être vite résumé : C&rsquo;est héberger des trucs directement dans le cloud (chez Amazon par exemple), sans avoir ni serveur dédié ni serveur virtualité.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand on est développeur, on peut vite rester bloqué sur les technologies qu&rsquo;on connait par coeur. Toutefois, c&rsquo;est dommage de ne pas continuer à découvrir de nouvelles pratiques ou technologies, car si demain. C&rsquo;est important si vous souhaitez évoluer dans la carrière de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;ailleurs pour ça que le <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>talent club</strong></a> a été crée. Il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;une communauté tech propulsée par talent.io qui donne accès à du contenu exclusif pour vous accompagner professionnellement. En vous inscrivant (<strong>c&rsquo;est gratuit !!</strong>), vous recevrez tous les 15 jours des conseils d&rsquo;expert(e)s de sociétés comme Google, Deezer, Sorabe&#8230;etc. directement dans votre boite mail. Les sujets partagés sont assez variés comme « Comment devenir VP of Engineering », « Comment passer du dev au produit », « Comment obtenir une augmentation », « quelles sont les choses à savoir quand on est le 1er dev d’une start-up », etc..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au sein du talent club, vous aurez aussi accès aux <strong>études de salaires annuelles dans la tech</strong> réalisées par&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\">talent.io</a>&nbsp;et à d&rsquo;autres outils pour gérer votre carrière</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/fuy-serverless-talentio\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"378\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et bien sûr qui dit communauté, dit possibilité de poser des questions à l&rsquo;ensemble des 40 000 inscrits, de manière anonyme. <a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Je vous invite à rejoindre la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenons à notre code et prenons un bout de PHP. Pour le faire fonctionner, vous avez besoin de louer, configurer, et maintenir un serveur. Et évidemment si ce bout de code PHP reçoit beaucoup de trafic, vous devrez aussi augmenter le nombre de serveurs ou libérer des ressources&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serverless, ça permet d&rsquo;éviter cela et donc de réduire les coûts opérationnels, aussi bien en termes d&rsquo;hébergement, que de maintenance&#8230;etc. Et surtout, comme on se repose sur les infrastructures de géants comme Google, Microsoft ou Amazon, ça ne tombe *jamais* en panne et ça peut être scalable (mise à l&rsquo;échelle pour absorber le trafic) très simplement.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est rigolo avec ce concept de serverless, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez y mettre toute votre application web par exemple ou simplement quelques fonctions critiques. Et c&rsquo;est cela dont on va parler aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, je vais vous expliquer comme exécuter une simple fonction écrite en PHP dans le cloud Amazon, en utilisant leur serveur AWS Lambda.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131403\" width=\"645\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-300x81.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-768x206.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Lambda permet d&rsquo;exécuter du code pour n&rsquo;importe quel type d&rsquo;application ou service backend sans avoir à administrer un serveur et en payant uniquement le temps de calcul que vous utilisez. Quand le code n&rsquo;est pas exécuté, vous n&rsquo;êtes pas facturé.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>De quoi a-t-on besoin ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez avoir besoin d&rsquo;un compte chez AWS pour accéder à <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fr/lambda/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lambda</a>.  Nativement avec Lambda, vous pouvez créer des fonctions nodejs, python, go&#8230;etc. Mais pas PHP, en tout cas, pas avec les outils fournis au niveau de la console d&rsquo;administration d&rsquo;AWS Lambda</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131404\" width=\"695\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-300x97.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-768x249.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Donc pour contourner le souci, on va utiliser un framework Composer qui s&rsquo;appelle <a href=\"http://bref.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bref</strong></a> et qui permet de faire tourner du PHP en Serverless sans se prendre la tête. C&rsquo;est top pour des jobs cron, des API ou des petits sites web dont les assets sont servis par Amazon S3. Par contre pour des applications complètes en PHP, ce sera un peu plus complexe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On passe à l&rsquo;installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Première étape : <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Installer Composer</a> sur votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>brew install composer</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez également <a href=\"https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">avoir besoin de npm</a> : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>brew install npm</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, vous allez devoir installer le framework Serverless dont Bref a besoin pour fonctionner. Cela lui permet d&rsquo;assurer la connexion avec AWS.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install -g serverless</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Droits utilisateur AWS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Côté AWS, vous allez avoir besoin de clés d&rsquo;accès. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\">Ça se passe par ici</a>.

Mais avec un petit fond sonore, c&rsquo;est mieux !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais on ne peut pas diffuser n&rsquo;importe quelle musique sur Twitch car sinon, ces derniers coupent le son pour des questions de droits d&rsquo;auteur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc passé par le site Chillhop qui propose des morceaux Lo-Fi / Chill parfaits pour faire un fond sonore sympa dans mon stream. Pour intégrer leur musique, j&rsquo;avais alors 2 possibilités : Streamer leur playlist via Spotify ou streamer leur live YouTube, directement depuis OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotify, je m&rsquo;en sers pour écouter ma musique copyrightée toute la journée donc je ne pouvais pas le dédier à ça. J&rsquo;ai donc créé une source browser chargeant une page HTML de mon cru permettant de jouer la playlist Chillhop en auto play.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"lofi hip hop radio - beats to study/relax to 🐾\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NOSDKb0HlU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-889942282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;était cool et ça fonctionnait bien. Jusqu&rsquo;au jour où Chillhop (ou YouTube) a bloqué l&rsquo;autoplay sur ses Lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus de musique de fond sur mes streams. J&rsquo;étais tristesse. Puis au bout d&rsquo;un moment, mes millions de viewers ont commencé à me réclamer de la musique en fond sonore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;écoutant que mon abnégation à leur égard, j&rsquo;ai donc décidé de trouver la parade pour streamer un live YouTube dans OBS. Je vais vous détailler tout ça, étape par étape. Pensez bien à envoyer l&rsquo;URL de cet article à votre streamer ou streameuse préférée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc parti (grâce aux conseils de ma communauté) sur l&rsquo;option VLC qui permet de tout faire et surtout de lire une vidéo YouTube directement depuis le player comme ceci (je suis sous macOS, mais pour Windows ou Linux, c&rsquo;est le même principe) :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais, il y a une source VLC dans OBS, mais je n&rsquo;ai jamais réussi à la faire fonctionner correctement. Donc je suis parti sur VLC, mais chargé à l&rsquo;extérieur d&rsquo;OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sauf que je n’ai pas besoin de la vidéo, mais uniquement du son. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté ce paramètre :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' <strong>--no-video</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1656088500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>À ce moment-là, le logiciel que j&rsquo;utilise pour ma table de mixage (<a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loopback</a>) n&rsquo;est pas encore compatible avec la dernière version de macOS. Je ne pouvais donc pas récupérer le son provenant de VLC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131001\" width=\"692\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-300x111.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-768x284.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il fallait donc que je me débrouille sans ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc entrepris de créer toujours avec VLC, un streaming du live YouTube de Chillhop, qui serait accessible via l&rsquo;URL http://localhost:2323 que je pourrais alors charger dans une source « Media Source » dans OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ca donne donc ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video <strong>--sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; comme dirait le chef Michel Dumas. Je peux alors créer ma nouvelle Media Source dans OBS et avoir le son de Chillhop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131002\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-768x560.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais il y a deux problème à cette ligne de commande : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Il faut que je pense à la lancer avant de démarrer mon live. E</li><li>t quand je la lance, ça démarre VLC qui est alors visible comme ceci :</li></ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131003\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8-300x166.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8-768x424.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-2014473609\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_4' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_4\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos4' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos4\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;est moche et si par réflexe, je ferme le terminal ou VLC, ça coupe la musique. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors pour masquer l&rsquo;interface de VLC, il suffit de le lancer avec ce paramètre : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>-I http</strong> 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toutefois, penser à le lancer à chaque fois, c&rsquo;est relou. C&rsquo;est là que j&rsquo;ai appris l&rsquo;existence des scripts dans OBS. En effet, on peut coder des scripts pour interagir avec OBS, soit en Python, soit en LUA. Je suis fan de Python donc je me dis que ça va être vite torché, mais malheureusement, j&rsquo;ai eu beau spécifier le bon interpréteur Python dans OBS, impossible de faire tourner le moindre script Python. Même un hello world ça ne fonctionnait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je ne pouvais pas non plus y passer des heures, donc je me suis rabattu sur le LUA. J&rsquo;ai donc pondu ce script en LUA pour appeler ma ligne de commande VLC. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est plusieurs centaines de lignes de code ultra complexes. Non, je déconne, c&rsquo;est juste une ligne de merde : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>-- Script LUA pour charger la musique de Chillhop dans OBS - https://korben.info\n\n<strong>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'\")</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai sauvegardé ce script en le nommant chillhop.lua, puis je me suis rendu dans OBS, menu « Tools » &gt; « Scripts » et j&rsquo;ai simplement ajouté mon script Lua dedans :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131004\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-300x214.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-768x548.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1293277903\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_5' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_5\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos5' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos5\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai relancé OBS et là, je me suis rendu compte que ça freezait tout mon OBS. En effet, en se chargeant, VLC bloque la suite du chargement de l&rsquo;application. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté un petit &amp; à la fin de la commande pour que OBS reprenne immédiatement la main et n&rsquo;attende pas comme un con que VLC ait terminé.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}' <strong>&amp;</strong> \")</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ça fonctionne. OBS démarre, exécute le script LUA qui à son tour lance VLC en arrière plan pour lire la musique et OBS peut alors récupérer dans sa Media Source le son diffusé via l&rsquo;adresse localhost. C&rsquo;est transparent et rapide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est cool avec tout ça, c&rsquo;est que ça ouvre un monde de possibilité pour augmenter et piloter OBS tout en script. C&rsquo;est donc à creuser. Il ne me manque plus que les bonnes idées maintenant.</p>\n",

Mais si c&rsquo;est le cas, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il y a de nombreuses bonnes raisons de le faire. Régulièrement cités <strong>parmi les services VPN les plus&nbsp;fiables</strong>, ils sont aussi&nbsp;plutôt novateurs et proposent des options qui deviennent régulièrement des standards.&nbsp;L&rsquo;une des dernières en date étant <strong>l&rsquo;innovation Nexus</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusivité Surfshark, <strong>Nexus</strong> permet de connecter l&rsquo;ensemble du parc de serveurs (+ de 3200) en un seul réseau qui couvre quasiment la planète entière. Le premier bénéfice étant de rendre votre <strong>connexion plus stable et rapide</strong>. Finis d&rsquo;être connecté à un serveur unique dont les performances vont&nbsp;être dégradées s&rsquo;il est surchargé. Par effet cascade le second avantage est donc d&rsquo;améliorer&nbsp;votre confidentialité. Puisque les informations transitent via plusieurs serveurs, cela fragmente la&nbsp;surveillance possible et renforce donc votre protection. Cette nouveauté sera déployée totalement d&rsquo;ici fin 2023.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"418\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/gds-surfshark4\" alt=\"Surfshark Nexus\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En attendant vous bénéficiez toujours des fonctionnalités déjà présentes :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>chiffrement de bout en bout (algo AES 256 GCM)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utilisation de protocoles sécurisés (WireGuard, IKv2/IPsec &#8230;)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>mode camouflage (cache à votre FAI que vous utilisez un VPN)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bouton kill switch (empêche vos données de fuiter lors d&rsquo;une déconnexion sauvage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>le split tunneling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>la protection lorsque vous vous connectez à un Wi-Fi public</li>\n\n\n\n<li>rotation d&rsquo;IP (sans déconnexion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>pas de conservations des logs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>blocage des pubs, cookies et autres malwares</li>\n\n\n\n<li></li>\n\n\n\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres nouveautés sont encore prévues dans les prochains mois, parce qu&rsquo;on peut toujours faire mieux. Comme par exemple la <strong>génération automatique d&rsquo;une nouvelle adresse IP</strong> pour chaque site que vous visitez (sans devoir déconnecter/reconnecter l&rsquo;outil).&nbsp;Si la&nbsp;<strong>fonction MultiHop</strong> est déjà disponible (elle permet de mettre un serveur supplémentaire entre vous et le&nbsp;site auquel vous vous connectez), elle&nbsp;disposera bientôt d&rsquo;une option pour l&rsquo;automatiser dans certains cas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"250\" height=\"141\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/krM6ANSNvFg52/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Exemple de MultiHop automatique</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous voulez tester le service pour pas cher ?

Pour 26 mois cela ne vous reviendra même pas à&nbsp;54€ au total, hors TVA, soit 84% de rabais. Ce qui fait toujours&nbsp;bien plaisir&nbsp;en pleine période d&rsquo;inflation. Un prix quasi&nbsp;imbattable pour un VPN de ce calibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes du genre à passer pas mal de commandes sur différents e-commerces, vous pourrez récupérer cette somme assez facilement. Comme vous le savez, les prix de certains produits, des billets d&rsquo;avions ou de trains, d&rsquo;un service de location &#8230; sont parfois dépendants de votre lieu de connexion. Avec Surfshark il suffit de tester depuis différents&nbsp;pays&nbsp;pour comparer les tarifs et prendre le plus intéressant pour vous. Et avec des serveurs dans plus de 100 localisations, il y a de quoi faire des tests et des comparaisons (sortez votre tableur Excel ;)).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l1IY5NRhxdCJYxsmA/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez même partager le prix de l&rsquo;abonnement&nbsp;avec plusieurs membres de la famille puisque le nombre d&rsquo;appareils supportés est illimité ! Votre enfant n&rsquo;a que 8 ans ? Pas d&rsquo;excuses, il faut lui apprendre les dures réalités économiques. S&rsquo;il veut continuer à regarder Adibou ou Pokémon, faut raquer ;p. Alors que d&rsquo;autres solutions vont (parfois) jusqu&rsquo;à 10 ou 12 appareils, Surfshark vous permet de protéger absolument tout et tout le monde. L&rsquo;ordinateur fixe,&nbsp;les 2 laptops, les 4 téléphones portables, la console de salon, le routeur&nbsp;et les équipements de la maison (Smart TV &amp; Co) &#8230; tout sera pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et surtout, en plus d&rsquo;être très abordable, Surfshark est&nbsp;un VPN parmi les plus fiables actuellement sur le marché.

Dispo dans le jeu <a href=\"https://returntomonkeyisland.com/the-story-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mais aussi en ligne</a>, c&rsquo;est mignon, rigolo, et bien pensé !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui frappe en premier lieu, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;univers graphique, très différent de ce qu&rsquo;on a pu voir auparavant. Faut dire que chaque jeu propose un style artistique unique, et celui-ci ne fait pas exception à la règle. Mais lorsque le jeu fut annoncé et les premières images dévoilées, nombre de trolls se sont indignés (à tel point que Ron Gilbert a cessé toute communication). J&rsquo;étais sceptique mais une fois dans le jeu, franchement, à part quelques points particuliers, c&rsquo;est magnifique. Tout est très lisible, coloré, détaillé, super bien animé…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131344\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajoutez à cela un habillage sonore enchanteur avec d&rsquo;excellentes musiques, et on est embarqué direct dans l&rsquo;ambiance ! On retrouve le thème principal de la série, évidemment, mais pas que. 😉 Les arrangements sont super réussis, j&rsquo;ai adoré !</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1488330414\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Enfin bref, on est là pour vivre une aventure de pirates et résoudre plein d&rsquo;énigmes. Qu&rsquo;en est-il de ce côté là ? Eh bien, je suis désolé pour le manque de suspense mais c&rsquo;est encore une réussite. 🦜 L&rsquo;interface est bien foutue, accessible et ergonomique. Il y a un mode « facile » pour les personnes qui ne connaissent pas trop ce genre de jeu, c&rsquo;est une bonne idée mais attention, ça enlève certaines énigmes et donc certaines parties de l&rsquo;histoire. Je conseille de jouer en mode « difficile ».</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131341\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est vraiment très bien écrite, c&rsquo;est super drôle et prenant. Le rythme énigmes / dialogues / découverte de nouveaux lieux m&rsquo;a semblé équilibré, avec toujours une certaine liberté dans l&rsquo;ordre d&rsquo;appréhender les choses. On est jamais totalement coincé devant un truc sans savoir quoi faire, on peut toujours aller voir ailleurs et avancer d&rsquo;une manière ou d&rsquo;une autre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au pire, y a un système d&rsquo;aide intégré au jeu, qui donne quelques indices sans jamais dévoiler la solution. Vraiment mieux que d&rsquo;aller chercher la <em>soluce</em> sur le web, c&rsquo;est bien dosé, vraiment nickel !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131342\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On sent l&rsquo;attention porté à chaque détail, et ce, sur chaque aspect. Les nouveaux venus sont accueillis aux petits soins, et les vieux de la vieille apprécieront les multiples références faites aux anciens jeux. Je pense que chacun peut y trouver son compte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non franchement j&rsquo;ai été conquis de bout en bout, pour les plus radins le jeu est actuellement disponible sur le Xbox Gamepass, mais vous pourrez aussi le trouver sur <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steam</a> (compatible Windows, Mac et Linux), <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/return-to-monkey-island-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/fr-fr/concept/10006133/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/fr-FR/games/store/return-to-monkey-island/9pc4r8n1n2t6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox Series X/S</a>&#8230; Pour moins de 25€ je ne peux que vous le conseiller !</p>\n",

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Les éditos sont faits pour ça 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-522601528\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai bien sûr repris les <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch les lundi, mardi et jeudi après-midi</a> et je dois dire qu&rsquo;on rigole bien. Comme d&rsquo;hab, je papote avec les followers, j&rsquo;écris mes articles et je bidouille des trucs. Après si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas dispo à ces heures là, y&rsquo;a évidemment les replays. Côté TikTok, ça commence a devenir également sérieux puisque j&rsquo;ai atteint <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@korbeninfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">un nombre conséquent d&rsquo;abonnés</a>. Ça ne rigole plus 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;ailleurs demain même si c&rsquo;est férié, ça va être tournage de vidéos. C&rsquo;est amusant à faire, donc c&rsquo;est que du plaisir, je vous rassure 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour les news. L&rsquo;hiver est enfin là, donc le mood est au feu de cheminée, au chocolat chaud et bientôt à la raclette ^^. Noël arrive, faut bien commencer à se mettre dans l&rsquo;ambiance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon et vous ça va ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tchuss !</p>\n",

Mais est-ce la seule chose que vous pouvez faire ? Bien sûr que non. Et aujourd&rsquo;hui je vais vous proposer <strong>quelques actions quotidiennes</strong> que vous pouvez mettre en place pour vous protéger sur le long terme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avant de commencer, j&rsquo;insiste juste sur le fait que chaque jour lorsque vous surfez sur le web, que vous utilisez des applications, etc. vos données sont récupérées. C&rsquo;est comme ça. Et même par des services fiables cela peut créer des problèmes. Ils peuvent se faire hacker leur base de données, des employés peuvent les revendre en soum soum ou la société peut décider de faire un rab de&nbsp;moula en la revendant une fois qu&rsquo;elle a fermé ses portes. Bref tout atterrit <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chez des data brokers qui collectent toutes ces infos</a></strong> et les revendent à prix d&rsquo;or. Parfois ces data brokers rachètent même des sites en perdition, juste pour disposer de la collecte de données qui a été réalisée (à des fins légitimes) pendant des années.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et même sans ça, vos données personnelles se retrouvent parfois disponibles en toute connaissance de cause. Par exemple sur des sites de fiches d&rsquo;entreprise lorsque vous créez une société, ou dans les fichiers PDF d&rsquo;un listing de diplômés d&rsquo;une école, de chercheurs dans une étude, etc.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"317\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/h55EUEsTG9224/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref nous sommes <strong>tous et toutes&nbsp;les vaches à lait de cette industrie</strong>. De manière directe&nbsp;ou au moins via les personnalités que nous nous créons en ligne (qui finissent par nous ressembler au final). Et s&rsquo;il est difficile de supprimer à 100% toutes nos traces numériques (surtout que la plupart du temps nous ne sommes même pas conscients d&rsquo;où elles circulent), il existe quelques possibilités pour limiter notre exposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1) Ne créez pas de compte si ce n&rsquo;est pas nécessaire</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon je sais, vous allez me dire que c&rsquo;est obvious. Je sais que ce n&rsquo;est pas votre cas, mes lecteurs adorés ont un QI supérieur à la moyenne. Mais qui ne connait pas une personne qui&nbsp;s&rsquo;ouvre un compte sur&nbsp;un e-commerce quelconque&nbsp;pour commander un objet pas cher et va ensuite laisser son compte existant pendant des années ? Peut-être qu&rsquo;en se demandant au départ si l&rsquo;objet en question est vraiment utile, le compte n&rsquo;aurait jamais eu besoin d&rsquo;être créé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"358\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPOqmCwBBEVPBOFYQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Est-ce qu&rsquo;ouvrir un 4e compte Instagram pour publier uniquement les photos&nbsp;de la tortue de compagnie&nbsp;est vraiment utile ? À vous de voir. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, passez au point suivant lorsqu&rsquo;il ne vous est plus d&rsquo;aucune utilité. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans le même esprit, ne donnez pas votre téléphone sans raison. Aussi bien dans les applis mobiles que dans les magasins physiques (si on vous les demande parfois ce n&rsquo;est que dans un seul but : vous balancer de la pub).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2) Fermer et supprimer vos comptes inutilisés</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais que vous avez déjà pensé à ce point. Mais êtes-vous vraiment un bon élève ? Vous êtes certain qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas un petit compte non utilisé depuis 2 ans et que vous gardez parce que la flemme de retrouver le mot de passe ? Ou parce qu&rsquo;on ne sait jamais, vous pourriez en avoir besoin un jour ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La question de la vie privée était beaucoup moins présente il y a 10 ans. Combien ont toujours des infos (ne serait-ce que l&#8217;email) sur des sites abandonnés comme MySpace, Flickr, StumbleUpon ou que sais-je&nbsp;? À partir du moment où votre adresse mail est quelque part, elle pourra servir à des gens pour vous bombarder de spams (selon les estimations 97% des adresses mail en reçoivent).&nbsp;Pire, imaginez qu&rsquo;il y a&nbsp;10 ans vous aviez un Skyblog&nbsp;avec une photo gênante et que l&rsquo;on parvienne à recouper l&rsquo;info avec votre adresse mail toujours active aujourd&rsquo;hui ?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2Kgm3KOBUE6wF2/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est parfois bien caché dans les options, il faut parfois envoyer un mail personnalisé, etc., mais prenez le temps de le faire.&nbsp;Vous pouvez vous aider d&rsquo;un site comme <a href=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Just Delete Me</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combien recevez-vous de communications commerciales que vous ne lisez jamais ? Est-ce que toutes les newsletters que vous recevez sont vraiment importantes ? Etc. Je suis sûr qu&rsquo;il y a moyen de limiter ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3) Renforcez la&nbsp;vie privée sur les réseaux sociaux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Là encore ça semble logique, mais beaucoup ne prennent pas le temps d&rsquo;effectuer les quelques clics nécessaires. Surtout que les réseaux sont sans doute LA source de récolte numéro 1 à l&rsquo;heure actuelle. Lorsque vous partagez votre localisation, balancez une photo d&rsquo;un endroit que vous visitez, parlez sans arrêt avec une même personne, etc. il n&rsquo;est pas très compliqué pour les algorithmes de vite se faire une&nbsp;image assez précise de vous, de vos préférences&nbsp;et de qui sont vos proches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;autant plus le cas lorsque vous connectez les services entre-eux (en vous connectant à des sites tiers avec vos identifiants Google ou&nbsp;Facebook par exemple), là ce sont tous les&nbsp;services interconnectés&nbsp;qui peuvent accéder à vos données. Les réseaux sociaux tirent littéralement leurs bénéfices des publicités ciblées. Et pour en tirer le meilleur afin que leurs pubs soient les plus&nbsp;rentables possibles ? Il leur faut accéder au max de vos infos, bingo.&nbsp;Donc les paramètres de protections par défaut sont (trop) souvent&nbsp;permissifs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/KPEpqHiJVrSVCOjyCP/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>À vous de limiter tout ça : ne pas laisser&nbsp;votre profil visible publiquement, retirer la géolocalisation,&nbsp;limiter qui a le droit de voir quoi, ne pas accepter la publicité ciblée, refuser les contenus supplémentaires, faire attention lorsque vous prenez des gens ou des lieux en photo, ne pas interconnecter les services, limiter au maximum les extensions, etc. Il y a quelques semaines&nbsp; je vous ai fait un petit guide&nbsp;pour <a href=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\">disparaitre de Google</a>, ça pourrait vous servir.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est pas non plus une mauvaise idée de supprimer vos anciens posts/tweets/photos, etc. s&rsquo;ils n&rsquo;ont plus rien à faire dans votre profil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4) Utilisez un navigateur web respectueux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Désinstallez Google Chrome, Microsoft&nbsp;Edge, Apple Safari&nbsp;&amp; Co. Privilégiez Brave, Firefox ou Tor Browser qui sont les 3 navigateurs les plus sécurisés à ce niveau. Laissez-les faire le plus gros du travail de prévention, ils bloquent par défaut de nombreux traqueurs, les profils comportementaux, etc. Pour Tor il faut quand même mentionner que certains FAI (si pas tous) vont vous brider le débit dès qu&rsquo;ils se rendront compte que vous l&rsquo;utilisez. Mais, quel que soit celui que vous choisissez, continuer à limiter le nombre d&rsquo;extensions installées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"324\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YsZBbMUeDLFNjQTtjz/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous voulez voir ce qui transparait avec votre navigateur actuel, il existe des sites <a href=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comme celui-ci</a>. Après sachez que même avec un bon navigateur, même avec un VPN, même avec Tor, etc. vous laisserez des bouts de&nbsp;traces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5) Retrouvez et faites supprimer vos infos chez les data brokers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant que vous avez limité au mieux la future&nbsp;récolte de vos données, comment faire pour celles qui trainent déjà sur la toile ? Il faudrait pouvoir retrouver tous les data brokers qui disposent de ces données, cela éviterait qu&rsquo;ils puissent continuer à les revendre. Si certains sont très connus (Spokeo, WhitePages &#8230;) pour d&rsquo;autres, il est très compliqué de remonter jusqu&rsquo;à eux. Si vous recevez un email de scam, un coup de fil marketing, etc. comment savoir d&rsquo;où ces gens ont&nbsp;obtenu vos infos ? Et lorsque vous avez fait ce travail digne de l&rsquo;inspecteur Derrick il faut encore obtenir du data broker qu&rsquo;il supprime ce qui doit l&rsquo;être. Multipliez cela par des dizaines de brokers et vous pouvez faire une croix sur vos soirées pour les 3 prochains mois.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est là qu&rsquo;intervient un service <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">comme Incogni</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"422\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/9u2-incogni1\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il vont faire le gros du travail pour vous. Déjà en répertoriant chez quels data brokers vos données personnelles se retrouvent, ensuite en les contactant à votre place&nbsp;pour qu&rsquo;ils&nbsp;suppriment ces données&nbsp;et ensuite en faisant un suivit pour s&rsquo;assurer qu&rsquo;elles ne réapparaissent pas dans les prochaines années. Et si les brokers ne répondent pas aux demandes, Incogni va les relancer jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Qu&rsquo;ils soient contactés par un service dont c&rsquo;est la spécialité ou par le mail dindon63@gmail.com de Mr Machin , ça risque de faire&nbsp;une différence 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez pas mal bourlingué sur le web depuis de nombreuses années et avec une identité&nbsp;figée (même adresse mail, même numéro de téléphone, mêmes services utilisés &#8230;), votre profil doit être assez précis et répandu. Pour moins de 6€/mois, la solution Incogni fera le nécessaire et vous tiendra au courant étape par étape via son tableau de bord. J&rsquo;ai d&rsquo;ailleurs <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">testé Incogni en détail</a> pour vous montrer comment cela se passe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"414\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer un peu tout ça, il faut avoir une bonne hygiène numérique au quotidien. Et lorsque les choses ont pris une certaine ampleur (ou que l&rsquo;on prend seulement conscience de l&rsquo;importance de faire respecter sa vie privée) il y a des services comme Incogni pour nous épauler. Bref nous ne sommes pas sans ressources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">Découvrez Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Et le fait de pouvoir intégrer ça dans vos scripts peut vous permettre d&rsquo;ajouter certaines fonctions sympas relatives à la compréhension / taggage d&rsquo;une image ou tout simplement à la génération d&rsquo;avatars ou d&rsquo;images diverses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici.</a></p>\n",

Donc si vous avez un NAS par exemple, et bien vous ne pourrez pas le stocker chez eux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À moins de prendre leur abonnement B2 qui offre un stockage pur et dur sans logiciel client.

Le concept est simple : pour avoir des sauvegardes efficaces et sérieuses, vous devez réaliser : </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 sauvegardes. 2 de ces sauvegardes sont stockées sur des supports différents (par exemple, un disque externe + un NAS) et la 3e sauvegarde doit être conservée hors site (donc pas chez vous). Cela peut être sur le cloud ou chez Tata Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée c&rsquo;est que si un incendie se déclare chez vous parce que vous avez chauffé votre maison avec vos meubles à cause de Bruno Lemaire, et bien même si toute votre famille a brulé, au moins, vous avez un backup de vos épisodes de Naruto.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130921\" width=\"494\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-300x122.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-768x312.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment pour gagner du temps, vous pouvez faire partir les 2 premiers backups (locaux) depuis votre ordinateur et le dernier off-site depuis votre NAS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour revenir à Backblaze en cas de souci, vous pourrez alors récupérer vos données soit en les téléchargeant directement depuis leur site, soit en vous faisant livrer un disque dur contenant vos données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors, maintenant comment faire pour sauvegarder TOUT votre NAS vers Backblaze alors que les disques réseau ne sont pas supportés dans leur application cliente ?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1681548937\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Et bien c&rsquo;est simple, il faut gruger un peu et faire croire à l&rsquo;outil que les répertoires réseau que vous voulez envoyer là-bas sont des répertoires locaux. Et pour cela, 2 façons de faire en fonction de votre OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes sous Windows, il vous faudra utiliser le logiciel libre <a href=\"http://dokan-dev.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dokany</a> qui permet de monter des systèmes de fichiers divers et variés (disque externe, disque réseau&#8230;etc.) pour les intégrer dans votre système de fichier actuel afin que toutes vos applications Windows puissent y accéder en toute transparence.

Et celui-ci est payant, car les gens qui utilisent des logiciels Apple ont de la grosse moula évidemment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il vous faudra donc vous offrir le logiciel <a href=\"https://automounter.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AutoMounter</a> pour la modique somme de 17 $ afin de monter vos disques distants un peu n&rsquo;importe où sur votre système macOS.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130923\" width=\"382\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp 653w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg-255x300.webp 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ce n&rsquo;est pas plus compliqué que ça. Et évidemment, les sauvegardes se feront de manière fluide, avec le client Windows ou MacOS <a href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00wmi7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backblaze</a> dans le cadre de votre forfait Personal Backup.</p>\n",

Mais voici quand même un exemple. Imaginons que dans votre dossier Downloads, vous ayez des tas de PDF que vous voulez déplacer dans un sous-dossier PDF ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lancez l&rsquo;édition de la config d&rsquo;Organize et scriptez comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># organize configuration file\n# https://organize.readthedocs.io\nrules:\n  - name: \"Find PDFs\"\n    locations:\n      - ~/Downloads\n    subfolders: true\n    filters:\n      - extension: pdf\n    actions:\n      - echo: \"Found PDF!\"\n      - move: ~/Downloads/PDFs/\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130867\" width=\"750\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp 821w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-300x281.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-768x718.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, une règle se compose : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>D&rsquo;un nom (name) (Vous mettre ce que vous voulez)</li><li>D&rsquo;un ou plusieurs emplacements (locations)</li><li>D&rsquo;actions (actions) pour afficher des messages ou agir sur les fichiers</li><li>Et d&rsquo;un tas d&rsquo;autres paramètres comme le parcours des sous dossiers, le filtrage des fichiers par extension&#8230;etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1876307667\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Cet exemple n&rsquo;est pas exhaustif. Il est par exemple possible de désactiver une règle en passant à « false » le paramètre « enabled ». Les filtres sont également intéressant car ils permettent de débusquer les fichiers selon la structure de leur nom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il y a vraiment beaucoup de paramètres qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans chacune de vos règles donc je vous invite encore une fois à vous pencher sur la doc. Si par malheur, Organize rencontre des conflits de fichiers, l&rsquo;outil dispose également d&rsquo;options pour résoudre cela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les données Exif peuvent également être extraites des fichiers pour ensuite être utilisées à votre convenance et l&rsquo;outil est capable d&rsquo;extraire du contenu de PDFs ou de fichiers DOCX&#8230;etc our mieux les catégoriser. C&rsquo;est hyper puissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un mode « simulation » permet également de tester vos règles sans risque afin d&rsquo;éviter de massacrer vos fichiers en cas d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un outil formidable qui en fait beaucoup. L&rsquo;essayer c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;adopter !</p>\n",

Très logiquement ces « soldes » avant l&rsquo;heure&nbsp;se sont propagées au web et&nbsp;sont souvent l&rsquo;occasion pour les boites Tech de proposer des tarifs intéressants, avec en tête de liste les VPNs. <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Cette année la promo Black Friday de Surfshark a lieu du 27 octobre au 27 novembre 2022</strong>.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/4kn-blackfriday-surfshark\" alt=\"Interface Surfshark\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a>, partenaire de longue date de korben.info (merci à eux !), ne déroge pas à la règle et vous propose chaque année des prix vraiment bluffants et qui valent le détour.&nbsp;Cette année par exemple vous pourrez bénéficier d&rsquo;un <strong>tarif de 2.05 $ par mois</strong> (soit environ 2.05 €) <strong><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sur un abonnement de 2 ans</a></strong> (24 mois) avec 2 mois offerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je n&rsquo;ai aucun mal à vous recommander Surfshark en tant que solution VPN à utiliser. Pas parce qu&rsquo;ils sont partenaires, mais parce que la boite est l&rsquo;une des plus sérieuses depuis son lancement en 2018. Et ne prenez pas mon avis comme argent comptant, je ne suis pas le seul à le dire. Encore dernièrement ils ont par exemple été récompensés&nbsp;lors de la <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://cybersecuritybreakthrough.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://cybersecuritybreakthrough.com/\" target=\"_blank\">6e CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards</a> grâce à leur solution <a href=\"https://surfshark.com/fr/surfshark-nexus-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nexus</a>, reconnue comme étant la meilleure solution VPN du marché.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark Black Friday 2022\" class=\"wp-image-131111\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022-300x91.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Toute la boite à outils pour protéger votre vie privée en ligne est bien entendu toujours présente.

Cela inclus de :&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cacher&nbsp;votre adresse IP</a> (+ rotation régulière)</li><li>ne pas conserver&nbsp;de traces de votre activité en ligne</li><li>contourner la censure et les contenus géolimités</li><li>chiffrer vos informations de bout en bout (algo AES-256-GCM)</li><li>protection de votre identité</li><li>bloquer les publicités, cookies &amp; co</li><li>se protéger des logiciels malveillants</li><li>protéger vos connexions sur les Wi-Fi publics</li><li>fonctionnalité Bypasser (leur fonction de&nbsp;split tunneling)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Toutes les fonctionnalités classiques sont de la partie. Et parmi les dernières nouveautés&nbsp;du service, on note qu&rsquo;ils ont dorénavant&nbsp;un parc de plus de 3200&nbsp;serveurs <strong>répartis dans plus de 100 pays différents</strong> ! Les nouveaux pays sont le Ghana, l&rsquo;Arabie Saoudite et Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;interface pour Linux (souvent le parent pauvre des OS) a récemment été retravaillée pour&nbsp;plus de lisibilité&nbsp;et voit l&rsquo;ajout d&rsquo;un bouton Kill Switch plutôt pratique. <strong>Le mode camouflage</strong> est, lui aussi, toujours de la partie. Pour rappel c&rsquo;est un mode assez sympa qui permet de cacher même à votre fournisseur d&rsquo;accès Internet que vous utiliser un VPN.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark dans 100 pays\" class=\"wp-image-131115\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark-300x147.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption><em>source : blog Surfshark</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cerise sur la tarte le nombre d&rsquo;appareils qui peuvent être connectés sur un compte est &#8230; illimité.&nbsp;Ordinateur fixe/portable, téléphones perso et pro, téléviseur intelligent,&nbsp;Google Home ou Alexa, routeur&nbsp;&#8230; tout est couvert ! Que ces appareils tournent sur Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, s&rsquo;utilisent via un navigateur web&nbsp;ou via une console (Xbox ou PlayStation) n&rsquo;est pas un souci.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais si vous voulez jeter un oeil du côté des options payantes (et facultatives) il y a aussi de quoi faire. Un moteur de recherche (<em>Surfshark Search</em>)&nbsp;qui vous permet d&rsquo;obtenir des résultats non traqués et impartiaux (pas des résultats faussés par votre historique et vos recherches précédentes). Un système de surveillance (<em>Surfshark Alerts</em>)&nbsp;qui permet&nbsp;d&rsquo;être alerté si certaines de vos informations personnelles sont divulguées. Ou encore un antivirus (plus de détails dans mon article <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Antivirus Surfshark</a>). Le pack des 3 est dispo pour 1.5€/mois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131122\" width=\"658\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-300x300.png 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-150x150.png 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-768x768.png 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1.png 1081w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Bon à savoir</em> : le prix affiché est de 2.22 $ (ou 2.25 €), mais au paiement ce sera ramené vers le bas&nbsp;autour de&nbsp;2.05 € (selon le taux de change du jour, pas merci à l&rsquo;€ de se faire défoncer depuis quelques mois).

Si vous utilisez déjà Surfshark pour surfer, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien de plus à installer pour profiter de l&rsquo;antivirus. Celui-ci est intégré au logiciel et ça permet d&rsquo;alléger votre machine en ayant un seul outil qui fait tout.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l4w-surfshark-antivirus\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Disponible sous Windows, macOS et Android, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark est vraiment très facile à utiliser</a>. Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Slick Inbox reçoit alors les missives électroniques pour les centraliser dans son application !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221006-m1g.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130710\" width=\"542\" height=\"548\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous ne connaissez pas de bonnes newsletters auxquelles vous abonner, ne vous inquiétez pas puisque Slick Inbox propose un kiosque avec des tonnes de newsletters classées par catégories : Design, Marketing, Développement Personnel, Technologie, Jeux Vidéos, Musique, Développement, Finance et j&rsquo;en passe&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi l&rsquo;application vous permet également de recevoir des motifs, de mettre en favori certaines newsletters, mais également d&rsquo;archiver ce que vous voulez&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un nouveau moyen bien pratique pour conjuguer ce moyen de communication archaïque qu&rsquo;est la newsletter avec nos vies trépidantes d&rsquo;hommes et de femmes modernes qui n&rsquo;ont pas de temps à perdre avec leur boite mail (genre moi).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ps : Je crois également que <a href=\"https://korben.info/feedly.html\"><strong>Feedly</strong></a> fait ça aussi.</p>\n",

Mais la vérité est ailleurs surtout pour les développeurs qui savent que le monde se divise en réalité entre le Frontend et le Backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour que ces 2 faces d&rsquo;une même pièce puissent « discuter », il nous faut des API. API, ça veut dire Application Programming Interface et c&rsquo;est tout simplement un ensemble d&rsquo;instructions permettant aux applications de communiquer entre elles. Maintenant des types d&rsquo;API, il y en a des tonnes, mais je vous propose qu&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui on s&rsquo;intéresse aux API qui respectent le standard architectural REST. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, quand on travaille en tant que développeur, on ne peut pas passer à côté des API REST, tant cette pratique est très répandue. Si vous débutez dans votre métier, c&rsquo;est forcement quelque chose que vous devez apprendre et maitriser. De la même manière, quand on débute sa carrière de développeur ou qu&rsquo;on a déjà beaucoup d&rsquo;années au compteur mais qu&rsquo;on ne connaît pas sa valeur sur le marché de l&#8217;emploi, il est bon de connaître la grille des salaires en France. Ça tombe bien puisque&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io a mis en ligne une étude des salaires de la tech en 2022</a></strong>&nbsp;pour que vous puissiez déterminer si votre salaire est correct ou sous évalué.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à vous plonger dedans afin de savoir où vous vous situez sur cette grille des salaires.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\"><img src=\"https://me.korben.info/w96-talent-bun\" alt=\"\" width=\"733\" height=\"484\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>C&rsquo;est quoi une API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>REST, ça veut dire « Representational State Transfer ». Lorsqu&rsquo;une API respecte les contraintes de REST, on parle alors d&rsquo;une API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand un développeur veut créer une API RESTful, il doit alors respecter les contraintes édictées par REST, notamment sur le fait que son API doit fonctionner au travers du protocole HTTP et de ses verbes (GET, POST&#8230;etc.) et que les requêtes et les réponses de l&rsquo;API soient dans un format texte tels que JSON, HTML, XML&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les API RESTful sont alors mises à disposition des applications via ce qu&rsquo;on appelle des endpoints. Un endpoint est un assemblage de 2 choses : une URI et un verbe HTTP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admettons que j&rsquo;ai une API qui permette de lister des utilisateurs, mais également d&rsquo;en créer des nouveaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;URI de mon API est la suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:&#47;&#47;url.com/api/user</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le but du jeu, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;appeler par exemple ce endpoint avec le verbe GET pour obtenir une liste de tous les utilisateurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>GET: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou pour ajouter un nouvel utilisateur, on peut utiliser le verbe POST comme ceci, en transmettant un bout de JSON contenant toutes les informations liées à l&rsquo;utilisateur qu&rsquo;on souhaite créer (nom, prénom&#8230;etc.) : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>POST: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée là, c&rsquo;est de vous montrer qu&rsquo;on peut interagir avec l&rsquo;API à l&rsquo;aide de différents verbes HTTP. Get peut être assimilé au verbe « lire », POST au verbe « créer », PUT et PATCH au verbe « Mettre à jour » et DELETE au verbe « supprimer ». C&rsquo;est aussi simple que cela. Et en retour le serveur peut alors répondre avec des codes de status HTTP classiques comme 200, 201, 2002&#8230;etc. pour dire que tout est OK, ou des codes de redirection 3xx, d&rsquo;erreur client 4xx ou d&rsquo;erreur serveur 5xx.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ce qui concerne le format utilisé par les requêtes et les réponses, vous pouvez utiliser du texte, peu importe son format (html, xml.etc.), mais par convention, on utilise surtout du JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Et JSON ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON a la particularité d&rsquo;être facile à lire et à écrire pour les humains et est utilisé pour enregistrer des données dans des bases de données, mais également pour transmettre ces données entre les applications. C&rsquo;est pourquoi on l&rsquo;utilise dans les API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON est une collection de paires nom / valeur qui sont ordonnées dans une liste. Ainsi les valeurs contenues dans le JSON peuvent être une chaine de caractère (string), un nombre, mais également des objets JSON, des tableaux de valeurs (Array), des booléens (true / false) ou la fameuse valeur null.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà concernant les grands principes des API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comment créer votre première API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant je vous propose qu&rsquo;on apprenne à en créer une de zéro. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est super simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour cette démo, j&rsquo;ai choisi d&rsquo;utiliser Python comme d&rsquo;habitude. Et je vais importer dans mon code le framework <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flask</a> qui va me permettre de faire monter mon API RESTful très facilement. Installez Flask comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pip3 install flask-restful</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour tester l&rsquo;API, nous allons utiliser un outil qui permet à la fois de balancer nos requêtes et de voir si les réponses correspondent bien. L&rsquo;un des plus connus s&rsquo;appelle Postman et c&rsquo;est gratuit en version de base pour tester. L&rsquo;application Desktop de Postman <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">est disponible ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/3y1-talent-API-REST\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, nous allons définir ce que va faire notre API. Ce sera quelque chose d&rsquo;assez simple permettant de créer, supprimer, lire et mettre à jour des données. Admettons que j&rsquo;ai un site sur lequel je dois référencer des produits. Chacun de ces produits aura un id, un nom, un prix et une catégorie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le code de votre première API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vais donc créer un fichier productAPI.py et je vais importer Flask comme ceci avec ses imports spécifiques aux API et au parsing JSON :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api, reqparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Puis je vais créer une espèce de mini base de données JSON directement dans mon code afin d&rsquo;y référencer mes produits :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>products = &#91;\n    { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Stylo 4 couleurs\", \"price\": 10, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cahier vert\", \"price\": 20, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Télévision 4K\", \"price\": 30, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Souris sans fil\", \"price\": 40, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 5, \"name\": \"Ananas\", \"price\": 50, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 6, \"name\": \"Kinder Bueno\", \"price\": 60, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 7, \"name\": \"Chemise de président\", \"price\": 70, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 8, \"name\": \"T-shirt de punk\", \"price\": 80, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 9, \"name\": \"Tournevis bleu\", \"price\": 90, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" },\n    { \"id\": 10, \"name\": \"Marteau rouge\", \"price\": 100, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" }\n    ]</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant on va créer une classe Product qui sera vu comme un endpoint au niveau de notre API. Et dans cette class, nous allons placer nos 4 fonctions correspondantes aux 4 verbes HTTP dont je vous ai parlé plus haut.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>class Product(Resource):\n\n    def get(self, id):\n\n    def post(self, id):\n\n    def put(self, id):\n\n    def delete(self, id):</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La structure de base de notre API est OK. Maintenant, on va définir chacune de ces fonctions en commençant par la fonction get utilisée pour récupérer les informations d&rsquo;un produit à partir de son ID. Comme vous pouvez le voir, on fait une boucle « for » qui va parcourir l&rsquo;ensemble des produits et si l&rsquo;ID correspond à ce qui spécifié dans la requête, on renvoie l&rsquo;objet « product » avec son code HTTP 200 et si ce n&rsquo;est pas le cas, on renvoie un message « Produit introuvable » accompagné d&rsquo;un code d&rsquo;erreur HTTP 404 qui correspond à une ressource non trouvée.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return product, 200\n        return \"Produit introuvable\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction suivante va nous permettre de créer un nouveau produit. La donnée utilisée dans la requête étant structurée en JSON, cette fonction va utiliser le parseur de Flask pour extraire toutes les données du JSON et les ajouter à notre tableau de produits : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def post(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return \"Ce produit {} existe deja\".format(id), 400\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois que le produit est créé, on retourne le code 201 qui veut dire que la création s&rsquo;est bien déroulée. Et si le produit existait déjà avec cet ID, on renvoie le code 400 avec un message d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction put suivante est assez similaire puisqu&rsquo;elle permet à la fois de créer un nouveau produit (si l&rsquo;id n&rsquo;est pas encore utilisé) ou de mettre à jour un produit existant.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def put(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                product&#91;\"name\"] = args&#91;\"name\"]\n                product&#91;\"price\"] = args&#91;\"price\"]\n                product&#91;\"category\"] = args&#91;\"category\"]\n                return product, 200\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, la fonction delete permettra de supprimer un enregistrement à partir de son ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def delete(self, id):\n        global products\n        products = &#91;product for product in products if product&#91;\"id\"] != id]\n        return \"{} is deleted.\".format(id), 200</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois ces fonctions définies, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à spécifier le format de l&rsquo;URI qui sera utilisé pour appeler l&rsquo;API et lancer l&rsquo;API (en mode debug pour démarrer). Le paramètre &lt;int:id&gt; permet d&rsquo;indiquer que dans le chemin du endpoint, on peut ajouter une variable acceptée par l&rsquo;API (ici l&rsquo;ID du produit).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>api.add_resource(Product, \"/product/&lt;int:id&gt;\")\napp.run(debug=True)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tester l&rsquo;API avec Postman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à lancer le script python à l&rsquo;aide de la commande suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python3 productAPI.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serveur web de Flask se lancera alors et vous verrez apparaitre une URL locale que vous pourrez appeler dans Postman pour ensuite tester votre API.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

produit (grâce à son ID) : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

qu&rsquo;on souhaite transmettre un contenu de type « RAW » au format JSON et appeler le endpoint avec l&rsquo;ID de notre nouveau produit (ce n&rsquo;est pas l&rsquo;idéal bien sûr, car le principe d&rsquo;un nouvel ID c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il soit généré directement par le code de l&rsquo;API, mais c&rsquo;est pour illustrer mon exemple).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure

/></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Et ensuite ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, ce n&rsquo;est vraiment pas compliqué à développer. Ici on est sur un exemple simple, mais ensuite, vous devrez pourquoi pas sortir vos données d&rsquo;une base de données, penser à correctement gérer les erreurs et faire preuve de rigueur dans la structure de vos endpoints. Par exemple, dans mon endpoint, l&rsquo;URI est xxxx/product/. J&rsquo;aurais pu faire mieux en respectant la convention et en mettant/products/ au pluriel. Car en cas de GET, je peux aussi demander à récupérer l&rsquo;ensemble des produits existants. Dans ce cas, je dois modifier ma fonction GET comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        if (id == 0):\n            return products, 200\n        else:\n            for product in products:\n                if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                    return product, 200\n            return \"Product not found\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, en passant l&rsquo;id 0 lors de mon GET, je récupérerai alors tous les produits.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"687\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130939\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp 687w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99-268x300.webp 268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas également de documenter l&rsquo;ensemble de votre API afin de vous y retrouver et surtout d&rsquo;indiquer à d&rsquo;autres développeurs, comment l&rsquo;intégrer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà, j&rsquo;espère que cette petite initiation et explications aux API RESTful vous aura intéressé et donné envie de vous y mettre plus sérieusement. Peut-être changer un peu votre façon de coder, voire carrément changer de job pour trouver une équipe plus agile et plus au fait des pratiques de dev modernes. Et pourquoi pas en profiter pour continuer à évoluer dans les technologies, ou obtenir un meilleur salaire. C’est une démarche qui peut s’avérer assez compliquée, stressante parfois, tant on a envie de trouver un travail qui nous corresponde. On peut souhaiter avoir un travail plus proche de chez soi voire en télétravail complet, un meilleur salaire, une meilleure ambiance au travail, ou même tout ça à la fois (mais ce n’est pas forcément facile à trouver).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heureusement, talent.io est là pour vous aider. Il vous suffit de&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">créer un compte sur la plateforme talent.io</a></strong>&nbsp;en quelques clics pour ensuite recevoir des offres de la part d’entreprises qui correspondent à vos critères précis et qui affichent un salaire d’entrée de jeu. talent.io est vraiment le moyen le plus simple de trouver son prochain job tech, d’ailleurs les inscrits trouvent leur emploi en 20 jours en moyenne.</p>\n",

Ce site vous permet de construire des « prompts », c&rsquo;est-à-dire des phrases à destination d&rsquo;outils comme Midjourney ou encore Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le principe est simple. Vous lui passez des URLs d&rsquo;images dont vous aimez le style, vous agrémentez tout cela de mots clés que vous pouvez pondérer puis vous pouvez choisir <a href=\"https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">des tas de paramètres et de styles</a> proposés et supportés par votre générateur (au hasard Midjourney) afin d&rsquo;obtenir le résultat de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Après moultes essais et inspiration prise dans la galerie de Midjourney et à l&rsquo;aide de DoctorMars (fidèle de Korben.info), j&rsquo;ai réussi à passer de ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130559\" width=\"493\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-300x79.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-768x203.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-779997892\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>À ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130560\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-300x300.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-150x150.webp 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-768x768.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce que je peux vous dire, c&rsquo;est que ce n&rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&rsquo;il y parait.

On s&rsquo;affronte par équipe de 4 en balançant de l&rsquo;encre partout ; et c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;équipe qui aura colorié le plus de territoire de sa propre couleur qui gagne la partie. C&rsquo;est ici que le jeu se démarque, car même si vous ne savez pas très bien viser, vous pouvez être utile à votre équipe. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Splatoon 3 – Maintenant disponible !

On peut facilement varier les plaisirs !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les modes de jeu, eux aussi, sont variés. Entre les matchs classiques, les parties « ranked » (matchs « anarchie » avec différentes règles du jeu possible !), ou bien en coopératif… Il y a de quoi faire ! On a même un jeu de carte assez cool, où l&rsquo;on construit son propre deck. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130718\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-300x168.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-768x431.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02.jpg 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le mode solo n&rsquo;est pas en reste, il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un tutorial géant mais vraiment sympa, où l&rsquo;on alterne entre phases d&rsquo;exploration et épreuves, nous faisant découvrir un large éventail d&rsquo;armes et de techniques. Bref, au niveau du contenu, c&rsquo;est vraiment généreux, sans même parler des cosmétiques, rangs et armes à débloquer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1910884207\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Techniquement, hormis la Cité-clabousse qui rame (allez savoir pourquoi), le jeu est ultra bien foutu : c&rsquo;est beau, lisible, super fluide ! La plate-forme réseau manque encore un peu de stabilité, mais elle est toute récente et s&rsquo;améliore continuellement, donc sur le moyen/long terme ça devrait le faire. Enfin j&rsquo;espère. 🤞</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130719\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Les menus ne sont pas d&rsquo;une ergonomie sans faille, ils ont voulu faire un truc classe avec un hub, des boutiques, etc. C&rsquo;est joli mais au final on se perd un peu, on perd du temps, et pire, on passe à côté de certaines options (perso j&rsquo;ai mis un temps fou à comprendre comment jouer à Cartes &amp; Territoire, ou comment modifier la skin de mon inkling)… C&rsquo;est un peu dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ceci étant dit, c&rsquo;est toujours mieux que dans Splatoon 2 ! 😁 Il y a de nettes améliorations, par exemple, on peut zapper l&rsquo;introduction de chaque nouvelle rotation de maps. Y a eu de vrais efforts pour rendre l&rsquo;expérience plus agréable. Quelques autres apports, en vrac :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Un meilleur lobby (avec entrainement pendant l&rsquo;attente, etc.)</li><li>De nouveaux mouvements pour nos calamars</li><li>Un casier à décorer avec des stickers</li><li>Nouvelles armes, maps, cosmétiques…</li><li>Les matchs à 3 équipes !</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130720\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Concrètement, ce n&rsquo;est pas une suite révolutionnaire, mais elle améliore et apporte plein de petites choses. Au final, quand on met tout bout à bout, ça fait une grosse différence. Si vous aimez les shooters, c&rsquo;est super original et surtout : très fun !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e9cJAw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acheter Splatoon 3 sur Nintendo Switch</a></h2>\n",

C&rsquo;est à dire qu&rsquo;on fait la course, mais en se goinfrant le plus possible sur le chemin : car c&rsquo;est la personne qui aura dévoré le plus de sucreries à la fin des 4 manches qui aura gagné. 😋 Deux manches sur circuits (à la manière d&rsquo;un Mario Kart en plus léger), et deux manches en arène (où on ramasse un max de gourmandises en essayant de faire tomber les autres pour piquer les leurs) : à la fin on pèse les Kirbys et que le plus lourd gagne !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130668\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le gameplay se résume à l&rsquo;essentiel : déplacement, saut, attaque spéciale (grâce aux bonus récupérés ici et là). Il y a juste la gestion de l&rsquo;inertie, propre à la petite boule qu&rsquo;on dirige, qui va demander quelques petites minutes d&rsquo;adaptation : le concept est aussi simple que la prise en main est immédiate, c&rsquo;est un party-game d&rsquo;une efficacité assez redoutable. Et tellement mignon&#8230; 🥰</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niveau contenu, en terme de modes de jeux ou nombre de circuits/niveaux, là aussi on se contente de l&rsquo;essentiel. Pas de quoi être déçu, car c&rsquo;est cohérent avec le prix affiché (15€). Pour les fous furieux, sachez qu&rsquo;il y a des tonnes de petits cosmétiques et autres à débloquer. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130669\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1146385180\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Jouable à 4 en ligne ou en local (chacun sa console), mais pas en écran splitté sur la même console : là on est limités à 2 joueurs.

Donc du matos réellement testé sur lequel chacun vient donner son avis. À vous ensuite de faire le tri en fonction de ce qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Est-ce le prix, la note du benchmark, la capacité, la vitesse ou la note globale ?
