It happened to us with <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> back in 2009. It happened with our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> in 2020. And it’s happening now with <a href='https://openai.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>OpenAI</a>’s <a href='https://chat.openai.com/chat' target=_blank rel=noopener>ChatGPT</a>. <span id=\"more-42458\"></span></p>\n<p>I’ve been tracking <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/core-areas/machine-learning/'>neural net technology</a> for a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/05/wolfram-language-artificial-intelligence-the-image-identification-project/'>long time (about 43 years, actually)</a>. And even having watched developments in the past few years I find the performance of ChatGPT thoroughly remarkable. Finally, and suddenly, here’s a system that can successfully generate text about almost anything—that’s very comparable to what humans might write. It’s impressive, and useful. And, as I’ll discuss elsewhere, I think its success is probably telling us some very fundamental things about the nature of human thinking.</p>\n<p>But while ChatGPT is a remarkable achievement in automating the doing of major human-like things, not everything that’s useful to do is quite so “human like”. Some of it is instead more formal and structured. And indeed one of the great achievements of our civilization over the past several centuries has been to build up the paradigms of mathematics, the exact sciences—and, most importantly, now computation—and to create a tower of capabilities quite different from what pure human-like thinking can achieve.</p>\n<p>I myself have been deeply involved with the computational paradigm for many decades, in the singular pursuit of building a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a> to represent as many things in the world as possible in formal symbolic ways. And in doing this my goal has been to build a system that can “computationally assist”—and augment—what I and others want to do. I think about things as a human. But I can also immediately call on <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> and Wolfram|Alpha to tap into a kind of unique “computational superpower” that lets me do all sorts of beyond-human things.</p>\n<p>It’s a tremendously powerful way of working. And the point is that it’s not just important for us humans. It’s equally, if not more, important for human-like AIs as well—immediately giving them what we can think of as computational knowledge superpowers, that leverage the non-human-like power of structured computation and structured knowledge.</p>\n<p>We’ve just started exploring what this means for ChatGPT. But it’s pretty clear that wonderful things are possible. Wolfram|Alpha does something very different from ChatGPT, in a very different way. But they have a common interface: natural language. And this means that ChatGPT can “talk to” Wolfram|Alpha just like humans do—with Wolfram|Alpha turning the natural language it gets from ChatGPT into precise, symbolic computational language on which it can apply its computational knowledge power.</p>\n<p>For decades there’s been a dichotomy in thinking about AI between “statistical approaches” of the kind ChatGPT uses, and “symbolic approaches” that are in effect the starting point for Wolfram|Alpha. But now—thanks to the success of ChatGPT—as well as all the work we’ve done in making Wolfram|Alpha understand natural language—there’s finally the opportunity to combine these to make something much stronger than either could ever achieve on their own.</p>\n<h2 id='a-basic-example'>A Basic Example</h2>\n<p>At its core, ChatGPT is a system for generating linguistic output that “follows the pattern” of what’s out there on the web and in books and other materials that have been used in its training. And what’s remarkable is how human-like the output is, not just at a small scale, but across whole essays. It has coherent things to say, that pull in concepts it’s learned, quite often in interesting and unexpected ways. What it produces is always “statistically plausible”, at least at a linguistic level. But—impressive as that ends up being—it certainly doesn’t mean that all the facts and computations it confidently trots out are necessarily correct. </p>\n<p>Here’s an example I just noticed (and, yes, ChatGPT has intrinsic built-in randomness, so if you try this, you probably won’t get the same result):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img1.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"190\" /></a></p>\n<p>It sounds pretty convincing. But it turns out that it’s wrong, as Wolfram|Alpha can tell us:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=How+far+is+it+from+Chicago+to+Tokyo%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img2a.png\" alt='How far is it from Chicago to Tokyo?' title='How far is it from Chicago to Tokyo?' width='620' height='308' /></a></p>\n<p>To be fair, of course, this is exactly the kind of the thing that Wolfram|Alpha is good at: something that can be turned into a precise computation that can be done on the basis of its structured, curated knowledge. </p>\n<p>But the neat thing is that one can think about Wolfram|Alpha automatically helping ChatGPT on this. One can <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/WolframAlpha.html'>programmatically</a> ask Wolfram|Alpha the question (you can also use a <a href='https://products.wolframalpha.com/api'>web API</a>, etc.): </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img3.png\" alt='' title='' width='610' height='60' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img3a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now ask the question again to ChatGPT, appending this result:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img4.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>ChatGPT very politely takes the correction, and if you ask the question yet again it then gives the correct answer. Obviously there could be a more streamlined way to handle the back and forth with Wolfram|Alpha, but it’s nice to see that even this very straightforward pure-natural-language approach basically already works.</p>\n<p>But why does ChatGPT get this particular thing wrong in the first place? If it had seen the specific distance between Chicago and Tokyo somewhere in its training (e.g. from the web), it could of course get it right. But this is a case where the kind of generalization a neural net can readily do—say from many examples of distances between cities—won’t be enough; there’s an actual computational algorithm that’s needed. </p>\n<p>The way Wolfram|Alpha handles things is quite different. It takes natural language and then—assuming it’s possible—it converts this into precise computational language (i.e. Wolfram Language), in this case: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img5.png\" alt='' title='' width='347' height='60' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The coordinates of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/City.html'>cities</a> and algorithms to <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GeoDistance.html'>compute distances</a> between them are then part of the built-in computational knowledge in the Wolfram Language. And, yes, the Wolfram Language has a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/knowledgebase/'>huge amount of built-in computational knowledge</a>—the result of decades of work on our part, carefully curating what’s now a vast amount of continually updated data, implementing (and often inventing) methods and models and algorithms—and systematically building up a whole coherent computational language for everything. </p>\n<h2 id='a-few-more-examples'>A Few More Examples</h2>\n<p>ChatGPT and Wolfram|Alpha work in very different ways, and have very different strengths. But in the interests of understanding where ChatGPT can take advantage of Wolfram|Alpha’s strengths, let’s discuss some cases where on its own ChatGPT doesn’t do quite the right thing. And one area where ChatGPT—like humans—often tends to struggle is math.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img6.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"248\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s an interesting, essay-style response. But the actual result is wrong:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+is+3+to+the+power+73%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img7a.png\" alt='What is 3 to the power 73?' title='What is 3 to the power 73?' width='620' height='361' /></a></p>\n<p>But if ChatGPT “consulted” Wolfram|Alpha it’d of course be able to get it right. </p>\n<p>Let’s try something slightly more complex:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img8a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img8a.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"436\" /></a></p>\n<p>At first glance, this result looks great, and I’d be inclined to believe it. It turns out, though, that it’s wrong, as Wolfram|Alpha can tell us:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=circumference+of+an+ellipse+with+half+axes+3+and+12\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img9b.png\" alt='Circumference of an ellipse with half axes 3 and 12' title='Circumference of an ellipse with half axes 3 and 12' width='620' height='259' /></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, doing math homework with ChatGPT (without it being able to consult Wolfram|Alpha) is probably a bad idea. It can give you a very plausible answer:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img10.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img10.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"364\" /></a></p>\n<p>But without “really understanding the math” it’s basically impossible for ChatGPT to reliably get the right answer. And in this case, the answer is again wrong:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+is+the+integral+of+x%5E2+cos%282x%29\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img11a.png\" alt='What is the integral of x^2 cos(2x)' title='What is the integral of x^2 cos(2x)' width='620' height='340' /></a></p>\n<p>Still, ChatGPT can even make up a very plausible-looking explanation of “how it got its answer” (not that it’s in any way how it really “did it”). And, rather charmingly (and interestingly), the explanation it gives has mistakes very similar to what a human who didn’t understand the math might also make:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img12.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img12.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"594\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are all sorts of situations where “not really understanding what things mean” can cause trouble: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img13.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img13.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"215\" /></a></p>\n<p>That sounds convincing. But it’s not correct:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+are+the+largest+countries+in+Central+America%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img14a.png\" alt='What are the largest countries in Central America?' title='What are the largest countries in Central America?' width='620' height='480' /></a></p>\n<p>ChatGPT seemed to have correctly learned this underlying data somewhere—but it doesn’t “understand what it means” enough to be able to correctly rank the numbers:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img15.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"353\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, yes, one can imagine finding a way to “fix this particular bug”. But the point is that the fundamental idea of a generative-language-based AI system like ChatGPT just isn’t a good fit in situations where there are structured computational things to do. Put another way, it’d take “fixing” an almost infinite number of “bugs” to patch up what even an almost-infinitesimal corner of Wolfram|Alpha can achieve in its structured way.</p>\n<p>And the more complex the “computational chain” gets, the more likely you’ll have to call on Wolfram|Alpha to get it right. Here ChatGPT produces a rather confused answer:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img16.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"236\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, as Wolfram|Alpha tells us, its conclusion isn’t correct (as it already in a sense “knew”):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=What+planetary+moons+are+larger+than+Mercury%3F\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img17a.png\" alt='What planetary moons are larger than Mercury' title='What planetary moons are larger than Mercury?' width='620' height='353' /></a></p>\n<p>Whenever it comes to specific (e.g. quantitative) data—even in fairly raw form—things very often tend to have to be more of a “Wolfram|Alpha story”. Here’s an example, inspired by a longtime favorite Wolfram|Alpha test query “How many turkeys are there in Turkey?”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img18.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"375\" /></a></p>\n<p>Again, this seems (at first) totally plausible, and it’s even quoting a relevant source. Turns out, though, that this data is basically just “made up”:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Livestock+populations+in+Turkey\"><img loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img19a.png\" alt='Livestock populations in Turkey' title='Livestock populations in Turkey' width='620' height='361' /></a></p>\n<p>Still, what’s very nice is that ChatGPT can easily be made to “ask for facts to check”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img20.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"228\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now feed these through the Wolfram|Alpha API:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img21a.png\" alt='' title='' width='505' height='302' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img21a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now we can ask ChatGPT to fix its original response, injecting this data (and even showing in bold where it did it):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2023/01/swchattech1923img22.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"479\" /></a></p>\n<p>The ability to “inject facts” is particularly nice when it comes to things involving real-time (or location etc. dependent) data or computation.

In each of these cases, and many more, a threshold was passed—usually quite suddenly. And some task went from “basically impossible” to “basically doable”.</p>\n<p>But the results are essentially never “perfect”. Maybe something works well 95% of the time. But try as one might, the other 5% remains elusive. For some purposes one might consider this a failure. But the key point is that there are often all sorts of important use cases for which 95% is “good enough”. Maybe it’s because the output is something where there isn’t really a “right answer” anyway. Maybe it’s because one’s just trying to surface possibilities that a human—or a systematic algorithm—will then pick from or refine. </p>\n<p>It’s completely remarkable that a few-hundred-billion-parameter neural net that generates text a token at a time can do the kinds of things ChatGPT can. And given this dramatic—and unexpected—success, one might think that if one could just go on and “train a big enough network” one would be able to do absolutely anything with it. But it won’t work that way. Fundamental facts about computation—and notably the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>—make it clear it ultimately can’t. But what’s more relevant is what we’ve seen in the actual history of machine learning. There’ll be a big breakthrough (like ChatGPT). And improvement won’t stop. But what’s much more important is that there’ll be use cases found that are successful with what can be done, and that aren’t blocked by what can’t.</p>\n<p>And yes, there’ll be plenty of cases where “raw ChatGPT” can help with people’s writing, make suggestions, or generate text that’s useful for various kinds of documents or interactions. But when it comes to setting up things that have to be perfect, machine learning just isn’t the way to do it—much as humans aren’t either.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what we’re seeing in the examples above. ChatGPT does great at the “human-like parts”, where there isn’t a precise “right answer”. But when it’s “put on the spot” for something precise, it often falls down. But the whole point here is that there’s a great way to solve this problem—by connecting ChatGPT to Wolfram|Alpha and all its computational knowledge “superpowers”. </p>\n<p>Inside Wolfram|Alpha, everything is being turned into computational language, and into precise Wolfram Language code, that at some level has to be “perfect” to be reliably useful. But the crucial point is that ChatGPT doesn’t have to generate this. It can produce its usual natural language, and then Wolfram|Alpha can use its natural language understanding capabilities to translate that natural language into precise Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>In many ways, one might say that ChatGPT never “truly understands” things; it just “knows how to produce stuff that’s useful”. But it’s a different story with Wolfram|Alpha. Because once Wolfram|Alpha has converted something to Wolfram Language, what it’s got is a complete, precise, formal representation, from which one can reliably compute things. Needless to say, there are plenty of things of “human interest” for which we don’t have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>formal computational representations</a>—though we can still talk about them, albeit it perhaps imprecisely, in natural language. And for these, ChatGPT is on its own, with its very impressive capabilities.</p>\n<p>But just like us humans, there are times when ChatGPT needs a more formal and precise “power assist”. But the point is that it doesn’t have to be “formal and precise” in saying what it wants. Because Wolfram|Alpha can communicate with it in what amounts to ChatGPT’s native language—natural language. And Wolfram|Alpha will take care of “adding the formality and precision” when it converts to its native language—Wolfram Language. It’s a very good situation, that I think has great practical potential.</p>\n<p>And that potential is not only at the level of typical chatbot or text generation applications. It extends to things like doing data science or other forms of computational work (or programming). In a sense, it’s an immediate way to get the best of both worlds: the human-like world of ChatGPT, and the computationally precise world of Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>What about ChatGPT directly learning Wolfram Language? Well, yes, it could do that, and in fact it’s already started. And in the end I fully expect that something like ChatGPT will be able to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/'>operate directly in Wolfram Language</a>, and be very powerful in doing so. It’s an interesting and unique situation, made possible by the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>character of the Wolfram Language as a full-scale computational language</a> that can talk broadly about things in the world and elsewhere in computational terms.</p>\n<p>The whole concept of the Wolfram Language is to take things we humans think about, and be able to represent and work with them computationally. Ordinary programming languages are intended to provide ways to tell computers specifically what to do. The Wolfram Language—in its role as a full-scale computational language—is about something much larger than that. In effect, it’s intended to be a language in which both humans and computers can “think computationally”.</p>\n<p>Many centuries ago, when mathematical notation was invented, it provided for the first time a streamlined medium in which to “think mathematically” about things. And its invention soon led to algebra, and calculus, and ultimately all the various mathematical sciences. The goal of the Wolfram Language is to do something similar for computational thinking, though now not just for humans—and to enable all the “computational X” fields that can be opened up by the computational paradigm.</p>\n<p>I myself have benefitted greatly from having Wolfram Language as a “language to think in”, and it’s been wonderful to see over the past few decades so many advances being made as a result of people “thinking in computational terms” through the medium of Wolfram Language. So what about ChatGPT? Well, it can get into this too. Quite how it will all work I am not yet sure. But it’s not about ChatGPT learning how to do the computation that the Wolfram Language already knows how to do. It’s about ChatGPT learning how to use the Wolfram Language more like people do. It’s about ChatGPT coming up with the analog of “creative essays”, but now written not in natural language but in computational language. </p>\n<p>I’ve long discussed the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/'>concept of computational essays</a> written by humans—that communicate in a mixture of natural language and computational language. Now it’s a question of ChatGPT being able to write those—and being able to use Wolfram Language as a way to deliver “meaningful communication”, not just to humans, but also to computers. And, yes, there’s a potentially interesting feedback loop involving actual execution of the Wolfram Language code. But the crucial point is that the richness and flow of “ideas” represented by the Wolfram Language code is—unlike in an ordinary programming language—something much closer to the kind of thing that ChatGPT has “magically” managed to work with in natural language.</p>\n<p>Or, put another way, Wolfram Language—like natural language&#8211;is something expressive enough that one can imagine writing a meaningful “prompt” for ChatGPT in it. Yes, Wolfram Language can be directly executed on a computer. But as a ChatGPT prompt it can be used to “express an idea” whose “story” could be continued. It might describe some computational structure, leaving ChatGPT to “riff” on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>what one might computationally say</a> about that structure that would—according to what it’s learned by reading so many things written by humans—be “interesting to humans”. </p>\n<p>There are all sorts of exciting possibilities, suddenly opened up by the unexpected success of ChatGPT. But for now there’s the immediate opportunity of giving ChatGPT computational knowledge superpowers through Wolfram|Alpha. So it can not just produce “plausible human-like output”, but output that leverages the whole tower of computation and knowledge that’s encapsulated in Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Language. </p>\n",

During the Version 13.2 cycle we’ve done about 61 hours of design livestreams—getting all sorts of great real-time feedback from the community (thanks, everyone!). And, yes, we’re holding steady at an overall average of one hour of livestreamed design time per new function, and a little less than half that per enhanced function.</p>\n<p>\t<a href=\"https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/\"><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw01delivering_liveceoimg1.png\" alt='Live CEOing livestreams' title='Live CEOing livestreams' width='591' height='456'/></a></p>\n<p><!--Section 02 Astro Computation--></p>\n<h2 id='introducing-astro-computation'>Introducing Astro Computation</h2>\n<p>Astronomy has been a driving force for computation for more than 2000 years (from the Antikythera device on)&#8230; and in Version 13.2 it’s coming to Wolfram Language in a big way. Yes, the Wolfram Language (and <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>) have had astronomical data for well over a decade. But what’s new now is astronomical computation fully integrated into the system. In many ways, our astro computation capabilities are modeled on our geo computation ones. But astro is substantially more complicated. Mountains don’t move (at least perceptibly), but planets certainly do. Relativity also isn’t important in geography, but it is in astronomy. And on the Earth, latitude and longitude are good standard ways to describe where things are. But in astronomy—especially with everything moving—describing where things are is much more complicated. Oh, and there’s the question of where things “are,” versus where things appear to be—because of effects ranging from light-propagation delays to refraction in the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The key function for representing where astronomical things are is <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AstroPosition.html\"><tt>AstroPosition</tt></a>.

(One direction is defined by the rotation axis of the Earth, the other by where the Sun is at the time of the spring equinox.)

And over the course of many years we’ve systematically solved problem after problem in supporting basically every kind of unit that’s in use (now more than 5000 base types). But one holdout has involved temperature. In physics textbooks, it’s traditional to carefully distinguish absolute temperatures, measured in kelvins, from temperature scales, like degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. And that’s important, because while absolute temperatures can be added, subtracted, multiplied etc. just like other units, temperature scales on their own cannot. (Multiplying by 0° C to get 0 for something like an amount of heat would be very wrong.) On the other hand, differences in temperature—even measured in Celsius—can be multiplied. How can all this be untangled?</p>\n<p>In previous versions we had a whole different kind of unit (or, more precisely, different physical quantity dimension) for temperature differences (much as mass and time have different dimensions). But now we’ve got a better solution. We’ve basically introduced new units—but still “temperature-dimensioned” ones—that represent temperature differences.

In other words, the process of evaluation would always go on until a fixed point was reached. “But what happens if <em>x</em> doesn’t have a value, and you say <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1?” people would ask. “Won’t the system blow up in that case?” Well, in some sense yes. But I took a calculated gamble that the benefits of infinite evaluation for ordinary computations that people actually want to do would vastly outweigh any possible issues with what seemed like “pointless corner cases” such as <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1. Well, 43 years later I think I can say with some confidence that that gamble worked out. The concept of infinite evaluation—combined with the symbolic structure of the Wolfram Language—has been a source of tremendous power, and most users simply never run into, and never have to think about, the <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1 “corner case”.</p>\n<p>However, if you type <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1 the system clearly has to do something. And in a sense the purest thing to do would just be to continue computing forever. But 34 years ago that led to a rather disastrous problem on actual computers—and in fact still does today. Because in general this kind of repeated evaluation is a recursive process, that ultimately has to be implemented using the call stack set up for every instance of a program by the operating system. But the way operating systems work (still!) is to allocate only a fixed amount of memory for the stack—and if this is overrun, the operating system will simply make your program crash (or, in earlier times, the operating system itself might crash). And this meant that ever since Version 1, we’ve needed to have a limit in place on infinite evaluation. In early versions we tried to give the “result of the computation so far”, wrapped in <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Hold.html'>Hold</a></tt>. Back in Version 10, we started just returning a held version of the original expression:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img6.png\" alt='' title='' width='463' height='80' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img6a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='rc6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='rc6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But even this is in a sense not safe. Because with other infinite definitions in place, one can end up with a situation where even trying to return the held form triggers additional infinite computational processes.</p>\n<p>In recent times, particularly with our exploration of multicomputation, we’ve decided to revisit the question of how to limit infinite computations. At some theoretical level, one might imagine explicitly representing infinite computations using things like transfinite numbers. But that’s fraught with difficulty, and manifest undecidability (“Is this infinite computation output really the same as that one?”, etc.) But in Version 13.2, as the beginning of a new, “purely symbolic” approach to “runaway computation” we’re introducing the construct <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TerminatedEvaluation.html'>TerminatedEvaluation</a></tt>—that just symbolically represents, as it says, a terminated computation.</p>\n<p>So here’s what now happens with <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img8.png\" alt='' title='' width='323' height='80' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img8a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='rc8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='rc8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A notable feature of this is that it’s “independently encapsulated”: the termination of one part of a computation doesn’t affect others, so that, for example, we get:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img9.png\" alt='' title='' width='609' height='118' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw11runawaycomputations121322img9a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='rc9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='rc9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>There’s a complicated relation between terminated evaluations and lazy evaluation, and we’re working on some interesting and potentially powerful new capabilities in this area. But for now, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TerminatedEvaluation.html'>TerminatedEvaluation</a></tt> is an important construct for improving the “safety” of the system in the corner case of runaway computations.

By default, it’ll propagate all the way up, so your whole computation will end up being aborted. But ever since Version 2 (in 1991) we’ve had the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CheckAbort.html'>CheckAbort</a></tt>, which checks for aborts in the expression it’s given, then stops further propagation of the abort.</p>\n<p>But there was always a lot of trickiness around the question of things like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TimeConstrained.html'>TimeConstrained</a>[ ]</tt>. Should aborts generated by these be propagated the same way as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Abort.html'>Abort</a>[ ]</tt> aborts or not? In Version 13.2 we’ve now cleaned all of this up, with an explicit option <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PropagateAborts.html'>PropagateAborts</a></tt> for <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CheckAbort.html'>CheckAbort</a></tt>.

These days we often prototype such functions in the <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/'>Wolfram Function Repository</a>, then further streamline their design, and eventually implement them in the permanent core Wolfram Language. In Version 13.2 just two new basic list-manipulation functions came out of this process: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PositionLargest.html'>PositionLargest</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PositionSmallest.html'>PositionSmallest</a></tt>. </p>\n<p>We’ve had the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Position.html'>Position</a></tt> since Version 1, as well as <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Max.html'>Max</a></tt>.

This is a question we’ve been working on for years, gradually inventing more and more mechanisms and solutions. In Version 13.2 we’ve made some small tweaks to a mechanism that’s actually been in the system for many years, but the changes we’ve made have a substantial effect on the experience of typing code.</p>\n<p>One of the big challenges is that code is typed “linearly”—essentially (apart from 2D constructs) from left to right. But (just like in natural languages like English) the meaning is defined by a more hierarchical tree structure. And one of the issues is to know how something you typed fits into the tree structure.</p>\n<p>Something like this is visually obvious quite locally in the “linear” code you typed. But sometimes what defines the tree structure is quite far away. For example, you might have a function with several arguments that are each large expressions. And when you’re looking at one of the arguments it may not be obvious what the overall function is. And part of what we’re now emphasizing more strongly in Version 13.2 is dynamic highlighting that shows you “what function you’re in”.</p>\n<p>It’s highlighting that appears when you click. So, for example, this is the highlighting you get clicking at several different positions in a simple expression:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img2.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='126' height='126' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here’s an example “from the wild” showing you that if you type at the position of the cursor, you’ll be adding an argument to the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ContourPlot.html'>ContourPlot</a></tt> function:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img4.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='533' height='121' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But now let’s click in a different place:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img6.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='533' height='121' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here’s a smaller example:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img8.png\" alt='Dynamic highlighting' title='Dynamic highlighting' width='111' height='25' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw14syntaxcoloring121322img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='sc8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='sc8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><!--Section 15 User Interface Conveniences--></p>\n<h2 id='user-interface-conveniences'>User Interface Conveniences</h2>\n<p>We first introduced the notebook interface in Version 1 back in 1988.

We’ve had the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Divide Cell</span> menu item (<span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>cmd</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>D</kbd></span>) for more than 30 years. And the way it’s always worked is that you click where you want a cell to be divided. Meanwhile, we’ve always had the ability to put multiple Wolfram Language inputs into a single cell. And while sometimes it’s convenient to type code that way, or import it from elsewhere like that, it makes better use of all our notebook and cell capabilities if each independent input is in its own cell.

One of the important features of the Wolfram Language in general is that a symbol <tt>x</tt> can just as well be an integer, a list of complex numbers or a symbolic representation of a graph. But the main way the compiler adds efficiency is by being able to assume that <tt>x</tt> is, say, always going to be an integer that fits into a 64-bit computer word.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language compiler has a sophisticated symbolic language for specifying types.

There are certainly values of <tt>x</tt> for which <em>x<sup>x</sup></em> won’t fit in a 64-bit integer. But the user might know those won’t show up. And so they can give a type hint that says that the <em>x<sup>x</sup></em> should be assumed to fit in a 64-bit integer, and this will allow the compiler to do much more with it.</p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that there are always going to be limitations to type inferencing, because, in a sense, inferring types requires proving theorems, and there can be theorems that have arbitrarily long proofs, or no proofs at all in a certain axiomatic system. For example, imagine asking whether the type of a zero of the Riemann zeta function has a certain imaginary part. To answer this, the type inferencer would have to solve the Riemann hypothesis.

Now we can take this result, and call a GEOS library function on it, using the Wolfram Language binding that’s been defined for that function:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw17largescale121322img4.png\" alt='' title='' width='378' height='81' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw17largescale121322img4a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ls4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ls4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This gets the result “back from GEOS” into pure Wolfram Language form:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw17largescale121322img5.png\" alt='' title='' width='209' height='216' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw17largescale121322img5a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ls5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ls5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>How does all this work?

It&#8217;s all based on new functionality in Version 13.2. And ultimately what it&#8217;s doing is to create a <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CompiledComponent.html\">CompiledComponent</a></tt> construct (which is a new thing in Version 13.2). A <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CompiledComponent.html\">CompiledComponent</a></tt> construct represents a bundle of compilable functionality with elements like <tt>\"Declarations\"</tt>, <tt>\"InstalledFunctions\"</tt>, <tt>\"LibraryFunctions\"</tt>, <tt>\"LoadingEpilogs\"</tt> and <tt>\"ExternalLibraries\"</tt>. And in a typical case—like the one shown here—one creates (or adds to) a <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CompiledComponent.html\">CompiledComponent</a></tt> using <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DeclareCompiledComponent.html\">DeclareCompiledComponent</a></tt>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of part of what&#8217;s added by <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DeclareCompiledComponent.html\">DeclareCompiledComponent</a></tt>:</p>\n<table class=''>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw17largescale121322img9.png\" alt='DeclareCompiledComponent' title='DeclareCompiledComponent' width='564' height='183' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw17largescale121322img9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ls9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ls9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>First there&#8217;s a declaration of an external (in this case GEOS) library function, giving its type signature. Then there&#8217;s a declaration of a compilable Wolfram Language function <tt>GEOSUnion</tt> that directly calls the <tt>GEOSUnion</tt> function in the external library, defining it to take a certain memory-managed data structure as input, and return a similarly memory-managed object as output.</p>\n<p>From this source code, all you do to build an actual library is use <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/BuildCompiledComponent.html\">BuildCompiledComponent</a></tt>. And given this library you can start calling external GEOS functions directly from top-level Wolfram Language code, as we did above.</p>\n<p>But the <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CompiledComponent.html\">CompiledComponent</a></tt> object does something else as well. It also sets up everything you need to be able to write compilable code that calls the same functions as you can within the built library.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that with all the new functionality in Version 13.2 it&#8217;s become dramatically easier to integrate compiled code, external libraries etc. and to make them conveniently distributable. It&#8217;s a fairly remarkable simplification of what was previously a time-consuming and complex software engineering challenge. And it&#8217;s good example of how powerful it can be to set up symbolic specifications in the Wolfram Language and then use our compiler technology to automatically create and deploy code defined by them.</p>\n<p><!--Section 18 And More--></p>\n<h2 id='and-more...-'>And More&#8230; </h2>\n<p>In addition to all the things we’ve discussed, there are other updates and enhancements that have arrived in the six months since Version 13.1 was released. A notable example is that there have been no fewer than 241 new functions added to the Wolfram Function Repository during that time, providing specific add-on functionality in a whole range of areas:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/\"><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/12/sw18andmoreimg1.png\" width='592' height='170' alt='New functions that have been added to the Wolfram Function Repository' title='New functions that have been added to the Wolfram Function Repository'></a></p>\n<p>But within the core Wolfram Language itself, Version 13.2 also adds lots of little new capabilities, that polish and round out existing functionality. Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Parallelize.html'>Parallelize</a></tt> now supports automatic parallelization of a variety of new functions, particularly related to associations.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Blurring.html'>Blurring</a></tt> now joins <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DropShadowing.html'>DropShadowing</a></tt> as a 2D graphics effect.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MeshRegion.html'>MeshRegion</a></tt>, etc. can now store vertex coloring and vertex normals to allow enhanced visualization of regions.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RandomInstance.html'>RandomInstance</a></tt> does much better at quickly finding non-degenerate examples of geometric scenes that satisfy specified constraints.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ImageStitch.html'>ImageStitch</a></tt> now supports stitching images onto spherical and cylindrical canvases.</p>\n<p>Functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Definition.html'>Definition</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Clear.html'>Clear</a></tt> that operate on symbols now consistently handle lists and string patterns.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindShortestTour.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>FindShortestTour</a></tt> has a direct way to return individual features of the result, rather than always packaging them together in a list.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PersistentSymbol.html'>PersistentSymbol</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/LocalSymbol.html'>LocalSymbol</a></tt> now allow reassignment of parts using functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/AppendTo.html'>AppendTo</a></tt>.</p>\n<p><tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SystemModelMeasurements.html'>SystemModelMeasurements</a></tt> now gives diagnostics such as rise time and overshoot for <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SystemModel.html'>SystemModel</a></tt> control systems.</p>\n<p>Import of <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/OSM.html\">OSM (OpenStreetMap)</a></tt> and <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/GXF.html\">GXF</a></tt> geo formats are now supported.</p>\n<p><!--Version Release Stripe--></p>\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; color: #555;\">\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndiv.bottomstripe { \n    max-width:620px; \n    margin-bottom:10px;\n    background-color: #fff39a;\n    border: solid 2px #ffd400;\n    padding: 7px 10px 7px 10px;\n        line-height: 1.2;}\n#blog .post_content .bottomstripe a,\n    #blog .post_content .bottomstripe a:link,\n    #blog .post_content .bottomstripe a:visited {\n     font-family:\"Source Sans Pro\",Arial,Sans Serif; \n     font-size:11pt; \n     color:#aa0d00;}\n</style>\n<div class=\"bottomstripe\">\n<a href=\"https://wolfram.com/get-upgrade/\"><strong>Download your 13.2 now! »&nbsp;</strong> (It’s already live in the Wolfram Cloud!)</a>\n</div>\n",

href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/10/celebrating-a-third-of-a-century-of-mathematica-and-looking-forward/'>34 years since the original launch of Mathematica</a> and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. And through all those years we’ve energetically continued building further and further, adding ever more capabilities, and steadily extending the domain of the computational paradigm.</p>\n<p>In recent years we’ve established something of a rhythm, delivering the fruits of our development efforts roughly twice a year. We released <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-13/'>Version 13.0</a> on December 13, 2021. And now, roughly six months later, we’re releasing Version 13.1. As usual, even though it’s a “.1” release, it’s got a lot of new (and updated) functionality, some of which we’ve worked on for many years but finally now brought to fruition.<span id=\"more-38521\"></span></p>\n<p>For me it’s always exciting to see what we manage to deliver in each new version. And in Version 13.1 we have 90 completely new functions—as well as 203 existing functions with substantial updates. And beyond what appears in specific functions, there’s also major new functionality in Version 13.1 in areas like user interfaces and the compiler.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language as it exists today encompasses a vast range of functionality. But its great power comes not just from what it contains, but also from how coherently everything in it fits together. And for nearly 36 years I’ve taken it as a personal responsibility to ensure that that coherence is maintained. It’s taken both great focus and lots of deep intellectual work. But as I experience them every day in my use of the Wolfram Language, I’m proud of the results.</p>\n<p>And for the past four years I’ve been sharing the “behind the scenes” of how it’s achieved—by <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>livestreaming our Wolfram Language design review meetings</a>. It’s an unprecedented level of openness—and engagement with the community. In designing Version 13.1 we’ve done 90 livestreams—lasting more than 96 hours. And in opening up our process we’re providing visibility not only into what was built for Version 13.1, but also of why it was built, and how decisions about it were made. </p>\n<p>But, OK, so what finally is in Version 13.1? Let’s talk about some highlights&#8230;.</p>\n<h2 id='beyond-listability:-introducing-threaded'>Beyond Listability: Introducing Threaded</h2>\n<p>From the very beginning of Mathematica and the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> we’ve had the concept of listability: if you add two lists, for example, their corresponding elements will be added:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityAimg1.png\" alt='{a, b, c} + {x, y, z}' title='{a, b, c} + {x, y, z}' width='156' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822beyondlistabilityimg1A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='bl1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='bl1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s a very convenient mechanism, that typically does exactly what you’d want. And for 35 years we haven’t really considered extending it.

But we never added a separate function to correspond to <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MapApply.html'>@@@</a></tt>. And over the years, there’ve been quite a few occasions where I’ve basically wanted, for example, to do something like “<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Fold.html'>Fold</a></tt><tt>[<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MapApply.html'>@@@</a>, ...]</tt>”.

Well, in Version 13.1, we added it: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MapApply.html'>MapApply</a></tt> is equivalent to <tt><a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MapApply.html\">@@@</a></tt>:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmoreAimg6.png\" alt='f @@@ {{a, b}, {c, d}}' title='f @@@ {{a, b}, {c, d}}' width='222' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmorelamguageimg6B_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='Byml6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='Byml6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Another small convenience added in Version 13.1 is <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameAs.html'>SameAs</a></tt>—essentially an operator form of <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt>. Why is such a construct needed? Well, there are always tradeoffs in language design. And back in Version 1.0 we decided to make <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt> work with any number of arguments (so you can test whether a whole sequence of things are the same). But this means that for consistency <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt><tt>[expr]</tt> must always return <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html'>True</a></tt>—so it’s not available as an operator of <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameQ.html'>SameQ</a></tt>. And that’s why now in Version 13.1 we’re adding <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SameAs.html'>SameAs</a></tt>, that joins the family of operator-form functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EqualTo.html'>EqualTo</a></tt> and <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GreaterThan.html'>GreaterThan</a></tt>:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmoreAimg7.png\" alt='SameAs' title='SameAs' width='332' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmorelamguageimg7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='yml7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='yml7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Procedural programming—often with “variables hanging out”—isn’t the preferred style for most Wolfram Language code. But sometimes it’s the most convenient way to do things. And in Version 13.1 we’ve add a small piece of streamlining by introducing the function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Until.html'>Until</a></tt>. Ever since Version 1.0 we’ve had <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/While.html'>While</a></tt><tt>[test,body]</tt> which repeatedly evaluates <tt>body</tt> while <tt>test</tt> is <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html'>True</a></tt>.

So if <tt>test</tt> isn’t <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/True.html'>True</a></tt> at first, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Until.html'>Until</a></tt> will still evaluate <tt>body</tt> once, in effect only looking at the test after it’s evaluated the body. </p>\n<p>Last but not least in the list of new core language functions in Version 13.1 is <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAt.html'>ReplaceAt</a></tt>. <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Replace.html'>Replace</a></tt> attempts to apply a replacement rule to a complete expression—or a whole level in an expression. <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAll.html'>ReplaceAll</a></tt> (<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAll.html'>/.</a></tt><tt>)</tt> does the same thing for all subparts of an expression. But quite often one wants more control over where replacements are done. And that’s what <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ReplaceAt.html'>ReplaceAt</a></tt> provides:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmoreAimg8.png\" alt='ReplaceAt' title='ReplaceAt' width='309' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmorelamguageimg8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='yml8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='yml8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>An important feature is that it also has an operator form:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmoreAimg9.png\" alt='ReplaceAt' title='ReplaceAt' width='311' height='51' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822yetmorelamguageimg9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='yml9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='yml9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Why is this important? The answer is that it gives a symbolic way to specify not just what replacement is made, but also where it is made. And for example this is what’s needed in specifying steps in proofs, say as generated by <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>.</p>\n<h2 id='emojis-and-more-multilingual-support'>Emojis! And More Multilingual Support</h2>\n<p>What is a character? <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>Back when Version 1.0 was released</a>, characters were represented as 8-bit objects: usually ASCII, but you could pick another “character encoding” (hence the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CharacterEncoding.html'>ChararacterEncoding</a></tt> option) if you wanted. Then in the early 1990s came Unicode—which we were one of the very first companies to support. Now “characters” could be 16-bit constructs, with nearly 65,536 possible “glyphs” allocated across different languages and uses (including some mathematical symbols that we introduced). Back in the early 1990s Unicode was a newfangled thing, that operating systems didn’t yet have built-in support for. But we were betting on Unicode, and so we built our own infrastructure for handling it.</p>\n<p>Thirty years later Unicode is indeed the universal standard for representing character-like things. But somewhere along the way, it turned out the world needed more than 16 bits’ worth of character-like things. At first it was about supporting variants and historical writing systems (think: cuneiform or Linear B). But then came emoji. And it became clear that—yes, arguably in a return to the Egyptian hieroglyph style of communication—there was an almost infinite number of possible pictorial emoji that could be made, each of them being encoded as their own Unicode code point. </p>\n<p>It’s been a slow expansion. Original 16-bit Unicode is “plane 0”. Now there are up to 16 additional planes. Not quite 32-bit characters, but given the way computers work, the approach now is to allow characters to be represented by 32-bit objects. It’s far from trivial to do that uniformly and efficiently. And for us it’s been a long process to upgrade everything in our system—from string manipulation to notebook rendering—to handle full 32-bit characters. And that’s finally been achieved in Version 13.1.</p>\n<p>But that’s far from all. In English we’re pretty much used to being able to treat text as a sequence of letters and other characters, with each character being separate. Things get a bit more complicated when you start to worry about diphthongs like æ. But if there are fairly few of these, it works to just introduce them as individual “Unicode characters” with their own code point. But there are plenty of languages—like Hindi or Khmer—where what appears in text like an individual character is really a composite of letter-like constructs, diacritical marks and other things. Such composite characters are normally represented as “grapheme clusters”: runs of Unicode code points. The rules for handling these things can be quite complicated. But after many years of development, major operating systems now successfully do it in most cases. And in Version 13.1 we’re able to make use of this to support such constructs in notebooks.</p>\n<p>OK, so what does 32-bit Unicode look like? Using <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CharacterRange.html'>CharacterRange</a></tt> (or <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FromCharacterCode.html'>FromCharacterCode</a></tt>) we can dive in and just see what’s out there in “character space”.

But gradually there have started to be more and more high-profile operations that are conveniently done by “pressing a button”. And rather than expecting people to remember all those special key sequences (or think to look in menus for them) we’ve decided to introduce a toolbar that will be displayed by default in every standard notebook. Version 13.1 has the first iteration of this toolbar. Subsequent versions will support an increasing range of capabilities.</p>\n<p>It’s not been easy to design the default toolbar (and we hope you’ll like what we came up with!) The main problem is that Wolfram Notebooks are very general, and there are a great many things you can do with them—which it’s challenging to organize into a manageable toolbar. (Some special types of notebooks have had their own specialized toolbars for a while, which were easier to design by virtue of their specialization.) </p>\n<p>So what’s in the toolbar? On the left are a couple of evaluation controls:</p>\n<p><span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarAimg2.png\" alt='Evaluation menu options' title='Evaluation menu options' width= '231' height='230' align='absmiddle'></span></p>\n<p><span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg3.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '25' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span> means “Evaluate”, and is simply equivalent to pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>ret</kbd></span> (as its tooltip says). <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg4.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '26' height='26' align='absmiddle'></span>means “Abort”, and will stop a computation. To the right of <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg5.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '25' height='25' align='absmiddle'></span> is the menu shown above. The first part of the menu allows you to choose what will be evaluated. (Don’t forget the extremely useful “Evaluate In Place” that lets you evaluate whatever code you have selected—say to turn <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RGBColor.html'>RGBColor</a></tt><tt>[1,0,0]</tt> in your input into <img style=\"margin-bottom: -2px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822redbox.png\" width='15' height='15' />.) The bottom part of the menu gives a couple of more detailed (but highly useful) evaluation controls.</p>\n<p>Moving along the toolbar, we next have:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg6.png\" alt='Menu option' title='Menu option' width='159' height='28' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='tb6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='tb6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If your cursor isn’t already in a cell, the pulldown allows you to select what type of cell you want to insert (it’s similar to the <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw052822toolbarimg7.png\" alt='Menu options' width= '64' height='27' align='absmiddle'></span> “tongue” that appears within the notebook).

Expect more features in later versions. One thing that’s notable about the toolbar in general is that it’s 100% implemented in Wolfram Language. And in addition to adding a great deal of flexibility, this also means that the toolbar immediately works on all platforms. (By the way, if you don’t want the toolbar in a particular notebook—or for all your notebooks—just right-click the background of the toolbar to pick that option.)</p>\n<h2 id='polishing-the-user-interface'>Polishing the User Interface</h2>\n<p>We first introduced Wolfram Notebooks with Version 1.0 of Mathematica, in 1988. And ever since then, we’ve been progressively polishing the notebook interface, doing more with every new version. </p>\n<p>The <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>=</kbd></span> mechanism for entering natural language (“<a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>-style”) input debuted in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/07/launching-mathematica-10-with-700-new-functions-and-a-crazy-amount-of-rd/'>Version 10.0</a>—and in Version 13.1 it’s now accessible from the <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg1.png\" alt='picture' width= '26' height='26' align='absmiddle'></span> button in the new default notebook toolbar. But what actually is <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg2A.png\" alt='picture' width= '35' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> when it’s in a notebook? In the past, it’s been a fairly complex symbolic structure mainly suitable for evaluation. But in Version 13.1 we’ve made it much simpler. And while that doesn’t have any direct effect if you’re just using <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg2A.png\" alt='picture' width= '35' height='' align='absmiddle'></span> purely in a notebook, it does have an effect if you copy <span class='Picture'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg2A.png\" alt='picture' width= '35' height='' align='absmiddle'></span> into another application, like pure-text email. In the past this produced something that would work if pasted back into a notebook, but definitely wasn’t particularly readable. In Version 13.1, it’s now simply the Wolfram Language interpretation of your natural language input:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg5.png\" alt='Natural language input' title='Natural language input' width='455' height='69' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>What happens if the computation you do in a notebook generates a huge output? Ever since <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v6/guide/Mathematica.html'>Version 6.0</a> we’ve had some form of “output limiter”, but in Version 13.1 it’s become much sleeker and more useful. Here’s a typical example: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 6px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg6A.png\" alt='Range' title='Range' width='120' height='' /><br />\n<img style=\"margin-top: 10px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg6B.png\" alt='Range' title='Range' width='595' height='' />\n</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Talking of big outputs (as well as other things that keep the notebook interface busy), another change in Version 13.1 is the new asynchronous progress overlay on macOS. This doesn’t affect other platforms where this problem had already been solved, but on the Mac changes in the OS had led to a situation where the notebook front end could mysteriously pop to the front on your desktop—a situation that has now been resolved.</p>\n<p>One of the slightly unusual user interface features that’s existed ever since Version 1.0 is the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Why the Beep?</span> menu item—that lets you get an explanation of any “error beep” that occurs while you’re running the system. The function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Beep.html'>Beep</a></tt> lets you generate your own beep. And now in Version 13.1 you can use <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Beep.html'>Beep</a></tt><tt>[\"string\"]</tt> to set up an explanation of “your beep”, that users can retrieve through the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Why the Beep?</span> menu item.</p>\n<p>The basic notebook user interface works as much as possible with standard interface elements on all platforms, so that when these elements are updated, we always automatically get the “most modern” look. But there are parts of the notebook interface that are quite special to Wolfram Notebooks and are always custom designed. One that hadn’t been updated for a while is the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Preferences</span> dialog—which now in Version 13.1 gets a full makeover:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg8.png\" alt='Preferences' title='Preferences' width='575' height='426' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When you tell the Wolfram Language to do something, it normally just goes off and does it, without asking you anything (well, unless it explicitly needs input, needs a password, etc.) But what if there’s something that it might be a good idea to do, though it’s not strictly necessary? What should the user interface for this be? It’s tricky, but I think we now have a good solution that we’ve started deploying in Version 13.1.</p>\n<p>In particular, in Version 13.1, there’s an example related to the <a href='https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository'>Wolfram Function Repository</a>. Say you use a function for which an update is available. What now happens is that a blue box is generated that tells you about the update—though it still keeps going with the computation, ignoring the update:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg9B.png\" alt='Update option' title='Update option' width='540' height='' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822polishingimg9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='ui9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='ui9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you click the <span class=\"computer-voice\">Update Now</span> button in the blue box you can do the update. And then the point is that you can run the computation again (for example, just by pressing <span class=\"kbd\"><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd></span>), and now it’ll use the update. In a sense the core idea is to have an interface where there are potentially multiple passes, and where a computation always runs to completion, but you have an easy way to change how it’s set up, and then run it again.</p>\n<h2 id='large-scale-code-editing'>Large-Scale Code Editing</h2>\n<p>One of the great things about the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> is that it works well for programs of any scale—from less than a line long to millions of lines long.

Using LSP (Language Server Protocol) we’ve provided the capability for most standard external IDEs to automatically do syntax coloring and other customizations for the Wolfram Language.</p>\n<p>In Version 13.1 we’re also adding a couple of features that make large-scale code editing in notebooks more convenient.

The issue is not so much the algorithm for generating the cells as it is how the cells can be represented in such a way that they’re useful for subsequent computations. In the 2D case each cell is just a polygon.</p>\n<p>But in the 3D case the cells are polyhedra, and to make a Voronoi mesh we have to have a polyhedral mesh where all the polyhedra fit together. And it’s taken us many years to build the large tower of computational geometry necessary to support this. There’s a somewhat simpler case based purely on cells that are always either simplices or hexahedra—that we’ve used for finite-element solutions to PDEs for a while.

What it fundamentally does is to take a Wolfram Language integer (which it assumes to be a machine integer), cast it into a C integer, then pass this to the library function, along with a specification of a C <span style=\"font-weight:Regular;font-family:Automatic\">char</span> * into which the library function will put its result, and from which the final Wolfram Language result will be retrieved.</p>\n<p>It’s worth emphasizing that most of the complexity here has to do with handling data types and conversions between them—something that the Wolfram Language goes to a lot of trouble to avoid usually exposing the user to. But when we’re connecting to external languages that make fundamental use of types, there’s no choice but to deal with them, and the complexity they involve. </p>\n<p>In the <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FunctionCompile.html'>FunctionCompile</a></tt> above the first new construct we encounter is</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822threesectionsimg21.png\" alt='CreateTypeInstance' title='CreateTypeInstance' width='403' height='21' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw062822threesectionsimg21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21threesections_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21threesections_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The basic purpose of this is to create the buffer into which the external function will write its results.

To do this requires the new function <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FromRawPointer.html'>FromRawPointer</a></tt>, which actually retrieves data from a specified location in memory. (And, yes, this is a raw dereferencing operation that will cause a crash if it isn’t done correctly.)</p>\n<p>All of this may at first seem rather complicated, but for what it’s doing, it’s remarkably simple—and greatly leverages the whole symbolic structure of the Wolfram Language. It’s also worth realizing that in this particular example, we’re just dipping into compiled code and then returning results. In larger-scale cases we’d be doing many more operations—typically specified directly by top-level Wolfram Language code—within compiled code, and so type declaration and conversion operations would be a smaller fraction of the code we have to write.</p>\n<p>One feature of the example we’ve just looked at is that it only uses built-in types.

I’ve heard some pretty <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/04/buzzword-convergence-making-sense-of-quantum-neural-blockchain-ai/'>wacky startup pitches</a> over the years, but this might possibly be the all-time winner. </p>\n<p>But as I thought about it, I realized that beyond the “absurdly extreme moonshot” character of this pitch, there’s some science that I’ve done that makes it clear that it’s also fundamentally philosophically confused. The nature of the confusion is interesting, however, and untangling it will give us an opportunity to illuminate some deep features of both intelligence and technology—and in the end suggest a way to think about the long-term trajectory of the very concept of technology and its relation to our universe.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with a scenario. Let’s say one of the little spacecraft comes across a planet where it sees complicated swirling patterns:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img1a.png\" alt='The Jupiter Great Red Spot' title='The Jupiter Great Red Spot' width='564' height='368' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img1a_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"more-38447\"></span></p>\n<p><spacer></p>\n<p>The spacecraft sends out a probe to “make contact”. The swirling pattern “responds” by changing slightly. The spacecraft analyzes the change, and sends out another probe. And pretty soon there’s a whole “conversation” going on between the spacecraft and the planet. But, you might say, that’s nothing like an “intelligence” there; there’s just a “pure physical system” that operates through physical laws. </p>\n<p>OK, but now let’s imagine the spacecraft has returned to Earth and is checking it out. It detects complicated <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-10--artificial-radio-signals/'>patterns of radio signals</a>. It sends out a radio signal of its own. Something on Earth responds. A “conversation” ensues. Maybe the spacecraft is “talking to” a cellphone tower, doing automated handshakes with it. Maybe it reached a ham radio operator, and is exchanging Morse code with them. Or maybe—in an ultimate version of code injection—there’s a computer that’s interpreting the spacecraft’s signals as a program, and is sending back the results of running the program.</p>\n<p>It all seems quite sophisticated—and at some level worthy of the technological civilization we’ve built up here on Earth. But let’s zoom out a bit. There’s something coming from the spacecraft, that’s causing something to happen on Earth, that’s causing something to be returned to the spacecraft.</p>\n<p>And ultimately whatever is happening on Earth must be a physical process of some kind—operating according to the laws of physics. So what’s the difference between this and those swirling “just physics” patterns that the spacecraft found on the other planet? Everything is ultimately “just physics” after all. </p>\n<p>OK, you might say, that’s surely true. But on Earth, even though we might have started from physics, we’ve somehow now “ascended” through chemistry and biology and technology to get to something that’s fundamentally more sophisticated. But here we run into an important—if at first surprising—piece of basic science: my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we represent all those “physical processes” as computations (and our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> implies that all of physics is indeed ultimately computational). Now we can compare the computations that correspond to the planet with the swirling patterns to the ones that correspond to our Earth with us humans in the loop.</p>\n<p>And what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that they’re ultimately equivalent. The computations associated with the swirling patterns are ultimately just as sophisticated as the ones we achieve with our brains and our technology here on Earth. It’s far from obvious that this would be true. But it’s something one discovers when one <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html'>explores the computational universe of possible programs</a>.</p>\n<p>One might think that simple programs would produce only simple behavior, and that somehow the behavior would get progressively more complex with more complicated programs. But that’s not what one finds. Instead, there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/'>increasing evidence</a> that almost any program that doesn’t show obviously simple behavior can in fact show behavior that is as sophisticated as anything. </p>\n<p>It’s been known for about a century that there exist computation universal systems capable of being “programmed” to do essentially any computation. But what the Principle of Computational Equivalence says is that sophisticated computation is not only possible—even for simple programs—but is something that happens generically and ubiquitously. </p>\n<p>So what does this mean for our spacecraft? It means that what the spacecraft sees on Earth can be computationally no more sophisticated than what it sees on the planet with the swirling patterns. Yes, we consider there to be “intelligence” here on Earth. But what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that ultimately there’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>nothing abstractly different going on</a> from what’s going on in the swirling patterns.</p>\n<p>So if we characterize what’s going on here on Earth as an example of “intelligence” we really should say that those swirling patterns are also “examples of intelligence”. And, yes, it doesn’t seem much like human intelligence. But at an abstract computational level it’s really operating like intelligence—but to us humans it’s “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>There’s a common saying: “The weather has a mind of its own”. And what the Principle of Computational Equivalence tells us is that, yes, fluid dynamics in the atmosphere—and all the swirling patterns associated with it—are examples of computation that are just as sophisticated as those associated with human minds.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so there’s a sense in which the weather “has a mind of its own”. But it’s definitely not a “human-like mind”. Yes, the weather does sophisticated computations. But there’s no obvious way to attribute to those computations the purposes and intentions and other typical features of how we describe what goes on in a human mind. So if indeed we’re going to talk about the weather as being an intelligence, for us humans we have to consider it an “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>We started off talking about spacecraft going out into the cosmos to discover alien intelligence. But what the Principle Computational Equivalence is telling us is that actually there’s what we can think of as alien intelligence all around us. Yes, we humans have managed to get to the point where we do all sorts of sophisticated computations. But computations of just the same sophistication are being done in all sorts of systems that don’t have that whole human tower of biology and technology.</p>\n<p>For a long time it’s been a mystery why we’ve <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>never detected alien intelligence</a> out there in the cosmos. But actually I think there’s no lack of “alien intelligence”; indeed it’s all around us. But the point is that it really is alien. At an abstract computational level it’s like our intelligence. But in its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>details it&#8217;s not aligned with our intelligence</a>. Abstractly it’s intelligence, but it’s not human-like intelligence. It’s alien intelligence.</p>\n<h2 id='the-role-of-science-and-technology'>The Role of Science and Technology</h2>\n<p>OK, so we can think of lots of systems as being examples of “alien intelligence”. But how does that alien intelligence connect to our human intelligence? Sometimes it’s close enough that we humans can immediately “anthropomorphize” the system to “understand what it’s doing in human terms”. But often we need to put effort into “making a bridge”. And in fact we can view that as being what science and technology are ultimately trying to do. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re looking at swirling patterns in a fluid. The fluid is doing what it does, in effect continually running a computation that generates its behavior. But how can we &#8220;align&#8221; that with what&#8217;s going on in our brains? That&#8217;s where science comes in. Because what science is trying to do is to extract some kind of &#8220;human-relatable narrative&#8221; from the actual behavior of a system out there in the world. Or in some sense it’s trying to provide a “channel” through which we can <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>&#8220;communicate&#8221; with the &#8220;alien intelligence&#8221;</a> that is embodied in what’s out there in the world.</p>\n<p>So what about technology? Fundamentally <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-11--implications-for-technology'>technology is about trying to take what exists</a> out there in the world, and apply it to achieve human purposes. We have a fluid. Now we use it to create hydraulic technology that achieves some practical human purpose. We can see the history of technology as being a progressive effort to identify things out there in the world (metal ore, photoelectricity, liquid crystals, &#8230;) that can be sampled and fashioned in such a way as to achieve certain purposes we want.</p>\n<p>And insofar as we think of what’s out there in the world as being like alien intelligence, what technology is doing is finding ways to corral that intelligence into achieving human purposes. The truth is that in most of our technology today, we’re not letting that intelligence really do <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-2--the-need-for-a-new-intuition'>anything close to what it&#8217;s capable of</a>. We’re keeping it tightly constrained to take only steps that we can readily understand and foresee. It’s a bit like having a horse with a harness that constrains it to just walk slowly in a straight line—even though without the harness the horse could gallop around and do all sorts of elaborate things, albeit things that we might not readily be able to understand or foresee.</p>\n<p>So let’s come back to the spacecraft. It’s reached a planet. And it’s interacting with what’s there. Perhaps there’s some weird electrical storm going on. And, yes, we can think of that as an example of alien intelligence. But if the mission of the spacecraft is to discover technology then what it needs to do is to figure out whether there’s some way to interact with the electrical storm so as to achieve some human purpose.</p>\n<p>The storm does what the storm does. But maybe by moving some piece of metal around in just the right way it’s possible to get the storm to charge a battery. Or, more elaborately, perhaps processes in the storm could be used like an analog computer, say to compute solutions to equations. And perhaps—having seen the storm on this planet—it’s even possible to “bottle it up” and replicate it, say in a piece of consumer electronics.</p>\n<p>One way to describe what’s going on is just to say rather prosaically that we discovered a phenomenon on the planet, that we were able to use for technology. But more colorfully we could say that we encountered an alien intelligence, we found a way to communicate with it, and then we “brought back” technology from it.</p>\n<p>The original startup pitch was about spacecraft getting technology by discovering alien intelligence out in the cosmos. But really the whole spacecraft thing is a distraction. Because actually—as we’ve discussed—there’s plenty we can describe as “alien intelligence” all around us, even right here on Earth. And the issue is in a sense just how to “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>communicate with it</a>” and find ways to “harness it” for our technological purposes.</p>\n<p>We’ve learned in the past century that we can use electrons in semiconductors as a way to build computers. But what about other physical processes? Maybe flowing fluids, for example. Can we use that “alien intelligence” to make a new kind of computer? In the end, the point is that any technology is about finding and harnessing “alien intelligence”. That’s basically just what technology is, and always has been.</p>\n<p>The whole “alien intelligence” part of the story, though, is much more relevant when we’re thinking of technology that makes serious use of what we can identify as sophisticated computation. If we’re just using a system from nature for its physical mass, it doesn’t really feel as if we’re using its “intelligence”. But as soon as we try, for example, to base a general computer on it, it’s a quite different story. </p>\n<p>In getting technology from the universe we’re basically picking out certain aspects of what exists and choosing to apply these for our purposes. In doing science it seems like we have “less choice” about what aspects of the universe we deal with. After all, we might imagine that science is trying to give us a way to understand anything that’s out there in the universe. But in reality it’s much more like technology. The “scientific narratives” that we understand—at least at a given time in history—are ones that we’re in a sense “primed for”. Yes, something like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-4--fluid-flow'>fluid turbulence</a> might give us “in-your-face” exposure to something computationally sophisticated that’s far from what we normally talk about. But what science mostly concentrates on is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>creating narratives that are aligned</a> with our existing scientific understanding and discussions—much as technology is set up to be about things that are aligned with our existing human purposes.</p>\n<h2 id='extracting-technology-from-the-ruliad'>Extracting Technology from the Ruliad</h2>\n<p>One might imagine that—wherever it ultimately comes from—technology must at least always in the end be based on the laws of physics. But what’s emerging from our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> is that actually the story is considerably more complicated than that. </p>\n<p>It all begins with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>: the object that represents the entangled limit of all possible computations. The ruliad is a unique, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>formally necessary object</a>, that in a sense embodies all conceivable existence. And inevitably we are embedded within the ruliad, sampling certain aspects of it to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>form our perception of reality</a>.</p>\n<p>In principle there are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#alien-views-of-the-ruliad'>all sorts of kinds of observers of the ruliad</a>, with all sorts of kinds of perceptions of reality. But the key point that has emerged as a foundation of our Physics Project is that “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#observers-like-us'>observers like us</a>” have certain general characteristics—specifically that we assume that we are persistent through time, and also that we are computationally bounded—and from these characteristics alone, we can abstractly deduce from the structure of the ruliad that we must “experience” core standard laws of known physics.</p>\n<p>The ruliad in a sense contains all possible physicses. But it’s our particular kind of sampling of the ruliad that leads us to the particular laws of physics that we currently know. An “alien intelligence” might sample the ruliad quite differently, and thus in effect “experience” quite different laws of physics.</p>\n<p>Somewhere underneath everything we can think of there being a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>giant hypergraph of individual atoms of existence</a>—but with the means of perception observers like us have, we inevitably “coarse grain” to the point where, for example, we experience this as continuous space. Another kind of observer, with different characteristics, might, for example, not do that coarse graining, might never experience continuous space, and might have a completely different perception of how the universe works.</p>\n<p>In some sense, therefore, physics is much more like technology than we might expect. There isn’t an “absolute physics”. There’s just the physics that we as observers extract from the ruliad. Much like there’s particular technology that we choose to build from the “raw material” that exists. Put another way, both physics and technology are ultimately things we “extract” from the ruliad, in effect by making certain choices.</p>\n<p>How we “extract” physics seems, however, much more constrained. For example, we as humans have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>only certain particular senses</a> through which we are biologically set up to experience the world. Yet we have the feeling that in technology we can in effect “construct whatever we want”—although inevitably “what we want” is also still at least influenced by how we are biologically set up.</p>\n<p>We’re very used to the idea that over time technology progresses—as we invent more, and work out new ways to use our “raw material” to achieve human purposes. But physics as a science progresses too. And in a sense what’s happening there is that we’re expanding our character as observers to be able to perceive and experience more of “what’s going on”—ultimately in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>Part of that expansion is actually a matter of technology. We’re building telescopes and microscopes and amplifiers that allow us to extend our raw human senses to be sensitive to more things. But there’s also another part of the expansion that is in effect intellectual: we’re developing new conceptual frameworks that allow us to “corral” things we see happening in the world into forms that “fit narratives” we’ve constructed.</p>\n<p>And the important point here is that neither our technology nor our physics is fixed. They’re in a sense co-evolving—gradually allowing more and more of the ruliad to be pulled into our narratives and our purposes. Or, put another way, what we observe is gradually expanding to encompass more and more of the ruliad, and to be able to make use of more and more of it. </p>\n<h2 id='reaching-out-across-rulial-space'>Reaching Out across Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>How are “different intelligences” manifest in the ruliad? We can imagine organizing the ruliad to be <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>laid out in some form of rulial space</a>. And from each point in rulial space one in effect gets a “different perspective” on the ruliad. And that&#8217;s at least the beginning of the story of how &#8220;different intelligences&#8221; exist and experience the ruliad.</p>\n<p>It’s similar to what happens with physical space: from different places in physical space one gets a different perspective on the universe. In physical space we have a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>concept of motion</a>: that observers like us can move from one place in space to another while in effect maintaining our coherence and integrity. </p>\n<p>How does this work in rulial space? We can think of different points in rulial space as corresponding to different computations, with different rules. So <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space'>rulial motion</a> in effect corresponds to making a translation between one computation and another. At the outset, it’s not obvious this would even in principle be possible. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies that it ultimately will be. The computations at different points in rulial space will (almost always) be equivalent in their sophistication—and as is typical with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>universal computation</a>—it’ll therefore in principle be possible to have an “interpretation process” that translates between them.</p>\n<p>But the big question is whether this can be achieved in practice. Just how far can a particular observer translate in rulial space while <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#what-can-human-mathematics-be-like'>maintaining their coherence and integrity</a>? </p>\n<p>The ruliad is a complex and (if sampled across slices in time) continually changing thing. But a critical feature is that there can be structures that have a certain persistence within it. In physical space these are things like particles (as well as black holes) that behave like “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>stable lumps of space</a>”—or like stable lumps in certain projections of the ruliad. In rulial space there can presumably also be structures with a certain persistence: <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-in-rulial-space'>&#8220;particles&#8221; of rulial space</a>. And these “particles” somehow correspond to features that “survive across different computational perspectives”—or in effect represent “robust concepts”.</p>\n<p>When we talk about “different intelligences” a very familiar example is different human minds. And in a sense we can think of different human minds as being laid out in rulial space—with each mind being at a different rulial position, and thus having a different computational rule by which it operates, and a different “experience of the ruliad”. </p>\n<p>So how can these minds “communicate”? Ultimately it is through “rulial motion”. But potentially the most robust form of rulial motion is through rulial particles—which we’ve identified above with the abstract idea of “robust concepts”. Put in a practical way: different (human) minds operate internally in different ways. But they can still “communicate” by exchanging something that in effect “survives translation” between one mind and another: rulial particles corresponding to robust concepts (say expressed in a language).</p>\n<p>But, OK, we can imagine rulial space with lots of human minds laid out at different places, with ones that communicate more easily closer together. So what about “alien intelligences”? Well, each one is somewhere in rulial space. But they may be far away from where our human minds are.</p>\n<p>We can imagine our rulial particles—or “robust concepts”—being able to reach a certain distance in rulial space. The human idea of “excitement” might for example be able to reach the place in rulial space where we’d find the minds of dogs. But what about the weather, for example? Well, as an alien intelligence, it’s presumably much further away in rulial space—and, anthropomorphize it as we might—it’s not clear what its notion of “excitement” would be.</p>\n<p>It’s an often-asked question why—with our spacecraft and radio telescopes and everything else—we haven’t ever run across what we consider to be “naturally occurring” alien intelligences. In the past we might have imagined that the answer is that there just isn’t anything like “intelligence” (outside of us humans) to be found in any part of the universe that we can probe. But the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> says that’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p822--intelligence-in-the-universe/'>fundamentally not true</a>, and that in fact “abstract intelligence” is thoroughly ubiquitous among systems with all but the most obviously simple behavior. </p>\n<p>So to “find” alien intelligence it’s not that we need a more powerful radio telescope (or a better spacecraft) that can reach further in physical space. Rather, the issue is to be able to reach far enough in rulial space. Or, put another way, even if we view the weather as “having a mind of its own”, the rulial distance between “its mind” and our human minds may be too great for us to be able to “understand” and “communicate with it”. </p>\n<p>So what will it take for us to “bridge this rulial gap”? At some level it’s just about building the right science and technology. We can think of science as being about defining a way to “translate” from the computational rules by which some particular system operates to the computational way our human minds operate. Or, in terms of rulial space, finding a way to “move” from the rulial position of the system to the rulial position of our minds—and translating from the way a system works to a “human narrative” that represents it.</p>\n<p>Centuries ago we might have just said “the planets do what they do”; maybe their motion in space is driven by an “alien intelligence” that we don’t understand. But then <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>along came mathematical science</a> and we were able to “translate” from the intrinsic computation done by the planets to a mathematical description that we internalized enough to consider it a human narrative that we understand.</p>\n<p>In some sense at any given time in intellectual history our minds “reach out a certain distance in rulial space”. We’ve developed conceptual frameworks that allow us to maintain a coherent understanding of a certain range of things—with that range growing as we invent new frameworks. At one time our “domain of understanding”—or the region of rulial space that we could reach—didn’t encompass the behavior of electricity. But our “intellectual expansion” in rulial space eventually reached this, and the result is that we can now use electricity as “raw material” from which to construct technology.</p>\n<p>One way we “expand our reach in rulial space” is in effect conceptual: by expanding what we understand. But another way is by being able to “sense” or “measure” more. When we invent radio—or, for that matter, gravitational wave detection—there are immediately new kinds of processes that we manage to “connect to human experience”. Or, put another way, there are more distant parts of the ruliad that we’re able to reach.</p>\n<p>More prosaically, we can say that if we want to be able to use something for technology, we’d better be able to detect that it’s there, and we’d better be able to understand it well enough that we can see how it could align with our human purposes. We can think of the ruliad as being full of alien intelligences—with plenty of capabilities to “mine”. But to be able to actually mine something for our technological purposes we have to be able to reach it across rulial space; we have to be able to connect it to us.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for the original startup pitch? Yes, it’s a good idea to “mine alien intelligences” for technology. In fact, that’s basically where technology always comes from. But there’s no need to send out spacecraft, “discover” alien intelligence, and so on. There are “alien intelligences” all around us; the issue is just to reach them across rulial space, and be able to “communicate” with them. But what we’ve argued is that the process of progressively reaching out in rulial space is just the general process of progressively advancing science (and the technology on which it depends).</p>\n<p>So, yes, by all means explore more of what’s out there in the world, with more, different kinds of sensors and measurements. Then try to “understand” what you see enough to be able to tell how to align it with human purposes, and make technology out of it. But there’s no pressing need for interstellar spacecraft in this picture. It’s just a matter of doing more science to expand our domain in the ruliad, and mine more of rulial space.</p>\n<h2 id='the-evolution-of-purpose-and-the-colonization-of-rulial-space'>The Evolution of Purpose and the Colonization of Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>We can think of technology as being about setting up things that exist in the world (or ultimately in the ruliad) to achieve human purposes. And we’ve talked about how the advance of science and technology allows us to progressively reach further in rulial space to get “raw material” for our technology. But we’ve said that technology is intended to “achieve human purposes”. So what might those purposes ultimately be?</p>\n<p>Our purposes have certainly evolved over the course of human history. In today’s world, we might view it as purposeful to walk on a treadmill, or to trade cryptocurrencies. But it would be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/#aliens-and-the-philosophy-of-purpose'>challenging to explain the purpose</a> of such things to someone from even a few hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>In a sense, purposes evolve as we build new conceptual frameworks, and as we set up technology that allows us to do new things. More abstractly, we might say that purposes are also something defined by places in rulial space. So when we talk about the evolution of purposes, what we’re really asking is where in rulial space our history and development has led us, and will lead us in the future.</p>\n<p>And certainly in the vastness of the whole ruliad, our existing human purposes occupy just an infinitesimally tiny part. Think, for example, of the natural world even as we are currently aware of it. The vast majority of things in it do not seem in any way aligned with our purposes—and we have not been able to mine them for technology. Historically, however, there’s been progressive expansion in the domain of our purposes. There was a time when we knew about magnetic rocks, but had no purpose for magnetism. But over the course of time, from compasses to actuators to memories, more and more human purposes have emerged that connect to the phenomenon of magnetism.</p>\n<p>And in a sense we can view the whole core trajectory of human progress as being about the expansion of the region of rulial space—and the ruliad—that represents our purposes. So how will this evolve?</p>\n<p>As I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>discussed extensively before</a>, there seem to be two central features that we as entities in the ruliad have. First, that we are computationally bounded. And second, that we believe we are persistent in time. Computational boundedness is essentially the statement that the region of rulial space that we occupy is limited. In some sense our minds can coherently span a certain region of rulial space, but it’s a bounded region. </p>\n<p>What about persistence in time? It means that even though we are always being reconstructed out of different atoms of existence (and different atoms of space), we conflate things to the point where we experience a single continuous thread of existence.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these features suggest a picture of us being a kind of “blob” that gradually <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>moves around</a> in rulial space. Does it matter that there isn’t just a single human mind? Well, yes. Without some kind of “observer” there’s no real way to even define what it means to have a “blob”. And in the end it’s a story of consistency of observers observing observers. But the result is that we can think of our whole collective “flotilla” of human purposes as being something localized that moves around in rulial space, expanding the region of the ruliad that it reaches.</p>\n<p>But just how far can this go? Imagine that at some time in the distant future we have successfully explored—and “colonized”—much of rulial space. To do this we’d certainly have to have broken out of the particular constraints of our biological construction, and made use of “additional raw material” in the ruliad. </p>\n<p>But what would it mean to be spread across a large swath of rulial space? Our very notion of existence seems to depend on localization in rulial space. The thing that we view as “us” is something particular and coherent. To be “bigger” in rulial space is to deny that particularity and coherence, and to become something generic that does not represent any kind of “specific entity that exists”.</p>\n<p>In a sense, it’s a pyrrhic view of the ultimate limit of our technological and other evolution. As we progress, we gradually “mine” more and more of the ruliad, pulling it into the domain of technology and of our “human” (or post-human) purposes. But in doing so, we eventually transcend the very characteristics that we identify with existence. In other words, if we go too far with our expansion in the ruliad, we simply cease to exist, at least in the sense that we currently define existence. </p>\n<p>Put another way, if we “absorb” more and more “alien intelligence” there’s eventually no longer any coherent “us”. Of course, the very notion of coherence is something we’re basically defining from our current human view of things. And no doubt there are other definitions that could be given. But they’re certainly far away from our current place in rulial space, and it’s not even clear they can be reached without some kind of “discontinuity of motion” that would in effect fundamentally break their connection to us as we are now.</p>\n<h2 id='face-to-face-with-alien-intelligence,-out-in-rulial-space'>Face to Face with Alien Intelligence, Out in Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>At a fundamental level, the ruliad is a purely computational object, that we can think of as being made of pure, abstract atoms of existence (or “emes”). When observers like us sample the ruliad we can attribute to it the characteristics that correspond to our perception of physical reality. And a notable feature of that sampling is that it supports the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>idea of pure motion</a> in physical space. In other words, it allows for the possibility that structures can “maintain their perceived physical integrity” while being “re-formed” out of different atoms of space, which themselves are interpretations of the pure atoms of existence in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But as soon as we start thinking about any kind of serious motion in rulial (rather than physical) space it no longer makes sense to talk about anything like “maintaining physical integrity”, not least because in different places in rulial space the very notion of physics changes. But wherever we are in the ruliad we can still think about what’s going on as computation. We might have some way of observing or sampling the ruliad that gives us some perception of reality—like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>physics</a>, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>mathematics</a>. But if we “atomize” things down to the lowest level, we’ll always find raw computation.</p>\n<p>As “physical observers like us” we only have limited capabilities to probe or manipulate the raw ruliad and affect what we perceive as physical reality. We can move physical objects around, maintaining what we observe of their structure. In principle we could <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/'>imagine deconstructing objects</a> into individual atoms of existence, then recreating them “transporter style” somewhere else in physical space. But as of now, we don’t know how to do this, and most likely it’s not possible for observers like us—because it would require “outcomputing” computationally irreducible features of the structure of space down at the level of individual atoms of space, which is far from what computationally bounded observers like us can expect to do.</p>\n<p>But what about raw computation, of the kind that ultimately makes up the ruliad? There the story is different. Because we’re no longer constrained by our character as physical observers, so we’re free to in effect “make up any computation we want”. To explore the physical universe we need physical motion or something like it. And at least for observers like us the only way to achieve this seems to be to progressively move structures across physical space. But to find out what can happen in the computational universe we can effectively just write down any rule (i.e. any program) that appears “anywhere in the ruliad”, and run it.</p>\n<p>Of course, when we run a rule on a practical computer, it’s just an emulation of what’s happening in the raw ruliad. But it’s just an abstract rule—so although it will run astronomically slower, its ultimate behavior in our emulation will inevitably be identical to what it is when implemented in terms of individual atoms of existence in the “raw ruliad”.</p>\n<p>In principle we could take the same approach in emulating the elements that make up our physical reality. But observers like us are so big relative to the raw elements of the ruliad that we can’t expect our emulations to be at a scale where we can faithfully reproduce what we perceive. (Needless to say, in practice we can still get good approximations, and this is a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/the-wolfram-physics-project-a-one-year-update/#towards-experimental-implications'>particularly fertile application of our Physics Project</a>.) </p>\n<p>But when we’re dealing with “raw computation” down at the lowest level of the raw ruliad, we can expect to faithfully emulate it. And so it is that we can just pick a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave'>cellular automaton</a> or a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machine</a> or some other kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>computational system</a>—that in effect comes from anywhere in the ruliad—and emulate it to find out what it does. There’s no “object we have to move” to be able to “look at that part of the ruliad”. We’re emulating things down at the level of individual atoms of existence, and seeing what happens.</p>\n<p>We can think about our computational experiments as letting us “jump” to find out what it’s like anywhere in the ruliad. And as we “suddenly materialize” somewhere in the ruliad it’s as if we’re immediately “face to face” with whatever “alien intelligence” there is at that place in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But what can “observers like us” expect to make of that alien intelligence? Well, to be able “communicate” or even “relate” we somehow have to be able to “bridge the gap in rulial space”. And since we just “jumped to a place in rulial space” we don’t immediately have any “progressive path” that “incrementally” takes us from our familiar position in rulial space to wherever the alien intelligence is.</p>\n<p>But what does that feel like in practice? The whole idea of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a> is just to go anywhere we want in the computational universe or in the ruliad, and see what happens when we run the rules we find there. And it’s indeed routine to find that what they do seems quite “alien”. Still, they often have certain essential features that for example remind us of the natural world as we observe it. But our standard methods of science (and mathematics)—developed on the basis of being “observers like we are today”—don’t readily allow us to “understand” the behavior of these systems chosen in the course of doing ruliology. To us they usually just seem to be “showing <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>”, and behaving in ways that we can effectively get no handle on. </p>\n<p>But still, we can in a sense view these programs “out there in the computational universe” (and in effect strewn around the ruliad) as showing us what’s possible. They’re like alien intelligences that we know exist, but that we don’t yet understand, and don’t yet know how to harness or relate to. We can see them as some kind of beacons of possible technology of the future—of things that “exist in the ruliad”, but that we haven’t yet been able to connect to human purposes.</p>\n<p>But so how might we make this connection? Well, as it happens, I’ve devoted much of my life to what can be viewed as the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>construction of a systematic bridge</a> between what’s “computationally possible” and what we humans think of as important. For that’s the story of what I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a>—and indeed of the whole intellectual structure that is the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s infinite potential content in the ruliad. But one can view the goal of the Wolfram Language as being to represent—in a way that’s optimized for us humans to understand—those parts that we humans consider important. The language lets us use the concepts of computation not only to crystallize our existing thinking, but also to expand what we can think about, in effect letting us reach out further in rulial space. Computational language is the general way that we “tame the ruliad”—extend the frontier of “human colonization” in the ruliad, and in the end “mine” more and more of the ruliad for “useful technology”.</p>\n<p>Just in terms of its practical place in the world today I’ve often said that the Wolfram Language is like an “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/our-mission-and-the-opportunity-of-artifacts-from-the-future/'>artifact from the future</a>”. But now we see a deep sense in which this is true. The raw ruliad is just “out there”, with “infinite potential”, but as something whose fundamental character has nothing to do with us humans. But what computational language is about is delivering what one can think of as the ultimate “meta-artifact”: something that progressively turns the raw ruliad into “human-recognizable technology”. </p>\n<p>Much of this progress involves the <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>specific, systematic design</a> of the Wolfram Language. But there are also forays that in effect jump further out into rulial space. For example, we’ve often enumerated large collections of simple programs, identifying ones that satisfy a certain criterion. And sometimes that feels a lot like “leveraging alien intelligence” without “understanding” it. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>rule 30 cellular automaton</a>, for example, is a good pseudorandom generator, even though we <a href='https://www.rule30prize.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>don&#8217;t really &#8220;understand&#8221;</a> even fairly basic things about it.</p>\n<p>And, yes, computational language is what we need to concretely “state a criterion”, in effect expressing what we’re thinking about in computational terms—that we can use, for example, to let us explicitly search the ruliad for an “alien intelligence” that does what we want.</p>\n<p>What does it look like out in the “raw ruliad”? It’s easy to start just looking at simple programs, say picked at random. And, yes, they have all sorts of elaborate behavior:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622img5b.png\" alt='' title='' width='452' height='360' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw061622AIimg5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But what is this behavior “achieving”? Yes, it’s following the particular underlying rules that have been given. But we don’t have any immediate way to connect it to “human purposes”. And in general we can expect that to make that connection what’s needed is for those purposes themselves to “expand”.</p>\n<p>Maybe at some moment we <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/music-mathematica-and-the-computational-universe/'>call what&#8217;s produced &#8220;art&#8221;</a>, and assign it some “aesthetic purpose”. Maybe at some point we see that it satisfies some engineering purpose that we’ve just realized we should care about. But in general, computational language is the way we can make the connection between “raw computational processes” out there in the ruliad, and our patterns of thinking about things. It’s the ultimate way for us to “communicate with alien intelligence”. </p>\n<h2 id='the-launch-of-a-rulial-space-program'>The Launch of a Rulial Space Program</h2>\n<p>We began with the far-out startup pitch of sending spacecraft to discover alien intelligence and bring its technology back to Earth. But what we’ve realized is that actually no spacecraft—of the ordinary kind—are needed. There’s “alien intelligence” to be found everywhere; you don’t have to travel to interstellar space to find it. But the challenge is to connect the “alien intelligence” to human purposes, and extract from it what we consider “useful technology”. Or, put another way, the issue is not about traversing physical space, but rather about traversing rulial space.</p>\n<p>With our spacecraft we humans have so far reached about a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28distance+to+furthest+manmade+object%29%2F%28radius+of+the+universe%29'>20-trillionth of the way across the physical universe</a>. But no doubt we’ve reached a far smaller fraction of the way across the ruliad. As our science, knowledge and technology increase, we gradually reach further into rulial space. But whether it’s our failure to communicate with cetaceans or our inability to make computers out of, say, fluids, it’s clear that by many measures the distance we’ve gone so far is not so large.</p>\n<p>In a sense the startup idea of “harnessing alien intelligence” is the meta-idea of all technology—that in our terms we can state as being to connect what’s “computationally possible” in the ruliad with purposes we humans want to achieve. And I’ve argued that the ultimate meta-technology for doing this is not spacecraft but computational language. Because computational language is what we need to make a bridge between what we care about, and “raw computation” out in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to send physical spacecraft out into interstellar space. But it’s actually a lot easier to probe the much richer possibilities of the ruliad—because in a sense it’s straightforward to put a “rulial spacecraft” anywhere. We just have to pick a rule (or program), then see what the “world” it generates is. But the challenge is then in a sense one of interpretation. What is happening in that world? Can we relate it to things we care about?</p>\n<p>At the outset, all we’re likely to see at some “random place” in the ruliad is rampant computational irreducibility. But it’s a fundamental fact that wherever there’s computational irreducibility, there must also be slices of computational reducibility to be found. In the ordinary physical universe that we experience, those are basically our perceived laws of physics. But even in a random sample of the ruliad we can expect there’ll be computational reducibility to be found. It’ll typically be “alien stuff”, though. It might have the character of science, but it won’t be like our existing science. And most likely it won’t align with anything we currently think we care about.</p>\n<p>But that is the great challenge and promise of mounting a “rulial space program”. To be confronted not with what we might recognize as “new life and new civilizations”, but with things for which we have no description and no current way of thinking. Perhaps we might view it merely as humbling to encounter such things, and to realize how small a part of the ruliad we yet understand. But we can also view it as a beacon of where we could go. And we can view a whole “rulial space program” as a way of systematizing the ultimate project of exploring all formally possible processes. Or we could think about it not just as defining a single “startup opportunity”—but rather as defining the “meta-opportunity” of all possible technology startups&#8230;.</p>\n",

But how can one get an intuition for what is initially the rather abstract <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>idea of multicomputation</a>? A good approach, I believe, is to see it in action in familiar systems and situations. And I explore here what seems like a particularly good example: games and puzzles.<span id=\"more-37124\"></span></p>\n<p>One might not imagine that something as everyday as well-known games and puzzles would have any connection to the formalism for something like quantum mechanics. But the idea of multicomputation provides a link. And indeed one can view the very possibility of being able to have “interesting” games and puzzles as being related to a core phenomenon of multicomputation: <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2022/06/multicomputational-irreducibility/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multicomputational irreducibility</a>.</p>\n<p>In an ordinary computational system each state of the system has a unique successor, and ultimately there is a single thread of time that defines a process of computation. But in a multicomputational system the key idea is that states can have multiple successors—and tracing their behavior defines a whole multiway graph of branching and merging threads of time. And the point is that this is directly related to how one can think about typical games and puzzles.</p>\n<p>Given a particular state of a game or puzzle, a player must typically decide what to do next. And where the idea of multicomputation comes in is that there are usually several choices that they can make. In any particular instance of the game, they’ll make a particular choice. But the point of the multicomputational paradigm is to look globally at the consequences of all possible choices—and to produce a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway graph</a> that represents them.</p>\n<p>The notion of making what we call a multiway graph has actually existed—usually under the name of “game graphs”—for games and puzzles for a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#some-backstory'>bit more than a hundred years</a>. But with the multicomputational paradigm there are now some more general concepts that can be applied to these constructs. And in turn understanding the relation to games and puzzles has the potential to provide a new level of intuition and familiarity about multiway graphs.</p>\n<p>My particular goal here is to investigate—fairly systematically—a sequence of well-known games and puzzles using the general methods we’ve been developing for studying multicomputational systems. As is typical in investigations that connect with everyday things, we’ll encounter all sorts of specific details. And while these may not immediately seem relevant to larger-scale discussions, they are important in our effort to provide a realistic and relatable picture of actual games and puzzles—and in allowing the connections we make with multicomputation to be on a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that the possibility of relating games and puzzles to physics is basically something that wouldn’t make sense without our Physics Project. For games and puzzles are normally at some fundamental level discrete—especially in the way that they involve discrete branching of possibilities. And if one assumes physics is fundamentally continuous, there’s no reason to expect a connection. But a key idea of our Physics Project is that the physical world is at the lowest level discrete—like games and puzzles. And what’s more, our Physics Project posits that physics—like games and puzzles—has discrete possibilities to explore.</p>\n<p>At the outset each of the games and puzzles I discuss here may seem rather different in their structure and operation. But what we’ll see is that when viewed in a multicomputational way, there is remarkable—and almost monotonous—uniformity across our different examples. I won’t comment too much on the significance of what we see until the end, when I’ll begin to discuss how various important multicomputational phenomena may play out in the context of games and puzzles. And how the very difficulty of conceptualizing multicomputation in straightforward human terms is what fundamentally leads to the engaging character of games and puzzles.</p>\n<h2 id='tic-tac-toe'>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>\n<p>Consider a simplified version of tic-tac-toe (AKA “noughts and crosses”) played on a 2×2 board.

Or, put another way, it’s when we find the multiway graph somehow “difficult to decode” that we get a rich and engaging game or puzzle.</p>\n<p>In any particular instance of playing a game we’re basically following a specific path (that in analogy to physics we can call a “timelike path”) through the multiway graph (or “game graph”) for the game. And at some level we might just make the global statement that the game graph represents all such paths. But what the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> suggests is that there are also more local statements that we can usefully make. In particular, at every step along a timelike path we can look “transversally” in the multiway graph, and see the “instantaneous branchial graph” that represents the “entanglement” of our path with “nearby paths”.</p>\n<p>Figuring out “what move to make next” is then in a sense about deciding in “what direction” in branchial space to go. And what makes a game difficult is that we can’t readily predict what happens as we “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/#motion-beyond-physical-space:-the-branchial-case'>travel through branchial space</a>”. There’s a certain analogy here to the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>. Going from one state to another along some timelike path, computational irreducibility implies that even though we may know the underlying rules, we can’t readily predict their consequences—because it can require an irreducible amount of computation to figure out what their consequences will be after many steps. </p>\n<p>Predicting “across branchial space” is a related, but slightly different phenomenon, that one can describe as “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2022/06/multicomputational-irreducibility/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multicomputational irreducibility</a>”. It’s not about the difficulty of working out a particular path of computation, but instead about the difficulty of seeing how many entangled paths interact.</p>\n<p>When one plays a game, it’s common to talk about “how many moves ahead one can see”. And in our terms here, this is basically about asking how “far out in branchial space” we can readily get. As <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>computationally bounded entities</a>, we have a certain “reach” in branchial space. And the game is “difficult for us” if that reach isn’t sufficient to be able to get to something like a “winning position”. </p>\n<p>There’s another point here, though. What counts as “winning” in a game is typically reaching some particular places or regions in the multiway graph. But the definition of these places or regions is typically something very computationally bounded (“just see if there’s a line of X’s”, etc.). It’s a certain “observation” of the system, that extracts just a particular (computationally bounded) sampling of the complete state. And then what’s key is that this sampling doesn’t manage to “decode the multicomputational irreducibility”. </p>\n<p>There’s an analogy here to thermodynamics. The fact that in thermodynamics we perceive “heat” and “entropy increase” is a consequence of the fact that our (coarse-grained) measurements can’t <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>&#8220;decode&#8221; the computationally irreducible process</a> that leads to the particular states generated in the system. Similarly, the fact we perceive it to be “hard to figure out how to win a game” is a consequence of the fact that our criterion for winning isn’t able to “look inside the playing of the game” and “decode what’s going on” to the point where it’s in effect just selecting one particular, straightforward path. Instead it’s a question of going through the multicomputationally irreducible process of playing the game, and in effect “seeing where it lands” relative to the observation of winning. </p>\n<p>There’s also an analogy here to quantum mechanics. Tracing through many possible paths of playing a game is like following many threads of history in quantum mechanics, and the criterion of winning is like a quantum measurement that selects certain threads. In our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> we imagine that we as observers are extended in branchial space, “knitting together” different threads of history through our belief in our own single thread of experience. In games, the analog of our belief in a single thread of experience is presumably in effect that “all that matters is who wins or loses; it doesn’t matter how the game is played inside”. </p>\n<p>To make a closer analogy with quantum mechanics one can start thinking about combining different chunks of “multiway game play”, and trying to work out a calculus for how those chunks fit together.</p>\n<p>The games we’ve discussed here are all in a sense pure “games of skill”. But in games where there’s also an element of chance we can think of this as causing what is otherwise a single path in the multiway graph to “fuzz out” into a bundle of paths, and what is otherwise a single point in branchial space to become a whole extended region.</p>\n<p>In studying different specific games and puzzles, we’ve often had to look at rather simplified cases in order to get multiway graphs of manageable size. But if we look at very large multiway graphs, are there perhaps overall regularities that will emerge? Is there potentially some kind of “continuum limit” for game graphs?</p>\n<p>It’ll almost inevitably be the case that if we look in “enough detail” we’ll see all sorts of multicomputational irreducibility in action. But in our Physics Project—and indeed in the multicomputational paradigm in general—a key issue is that relevant observers don’t see that level of detail. And much like the emergence of thermodynamics or the gas laws from underlying molecular dynamics, the very existence of underlying computational irreducibility inevitably leads to simple laws for what the observer can perceive.</p>\n<p>So what is the analog of “the observer” for a game? For at least some purposes it can be thought of as basically the “win” criteria. So now the question arises: if we look only at these criteria, can we derive the analog of “laws of physics”, insensitive to all the multicomputationally irreducible details underneath?</p>\n<p>There’s much more to figure out about this, but perhaps one place to start is to look at the large-scale structure of branchial space—and the multiway graph—in various games. And one basic impression in many different games is that—while the character of branchial graphs may change between “different stages” in the game—across a single branchial graph there tends to be a certain uniformity. If one looks at the details there may be plenty of multicomputational irreducibility. But at some kind of “perceptible level” different parts of the graph may seem similar. And this suggests that the “local impression of the game” will tend to be similar at a particular stage even when quite different moves have been made, that take one to quite different parts of the “game space” defined by the branchial graph.</p>\n<p>But while there may be similarity between different parts of the branchial graph, what we’ve seen is that in some games and puzzles the branchial graph breaks up into multiple disconnected regions. And what this reflects is the presence of distinct “conserved sectors” in a game—regions of game space that players can get into, but are then stuck with (at least for a certain time), much as in spacetime <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>event horizons can prevent transport</a> between different regions of physical space. </p>\n<p>Another (related) effect that we notice in some games and puzzles but not others is large “holes” in the multiway graph: places where between two points in the graph there are multiple “distant” paths. When the multiway graph is densely connected, there’ll typically always be a way to “fix any mistake” by rerouting through nearby paths. But when there is a hole it is a sign that one can end up getting “committed” to one course of action rather than another, and it will be many steps before it’s possible to get to the same place as the other course of action would have reached. </p>\n<p>If we assume that at some level all we ultimately “observe” in the multiway graph is the kind of coarse-graining that corresponds to assessing winning or losing then inevitably we’ll be dealing with a distribution of possible paths. Without “holes” these paths can be close together, and may seem obviously similar. But when there’s a hole there can be different paths that are far apart. And the fact there can be distant paths that are “part of the same distribution” can then potentially be thought of as something like a quantum superposition effect. </p>\n<p>Are there analogs of general relativity and the path integral in games? To formulate this with clarity we’d have to define more carefully the character of “game space”. Presumably there’ll be the analog of a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-causal-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal graph</a>. And presumably there’ll also be an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-energy-what-is-mass'>analog of energy</a> in game space, associated with the “density of activity” at different places in game space. Then the analog of the phenomenon of gravity will be something like that the best game plays (i.e. the geodesic paths through the game graph) will tend to be deflected by the presence of high densities of activity. In other words, if there are lots of things to do when a game is in a certain state, good game plays will tend to be “pulled towards that state”. And at some level this isn’t surprising: when there’s high density of activity in the game graph, there will tend to be more options about what to do, so it’s more likely that one will be able to “do a good game play” if one goes through there.</p>\n<p>So far we didn’t explicitly talk about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-12--games-between-programs/'>strategies for games</a>. But in our multicomputational framework a strategy has a fairly definite interpretation: it is a place in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>rulial space</a>, where in effect one’s assuming a certain set of rules about how to construct the multiway graph. In other words, given a strategy one is choosing some edges in the multiway graph (or some possible events in the associated multiway causal graph), and dropping others. </p>\n<p>In general it can be hard to talk about the “space of possible strategies”—because it’s like talking about the “space of possible programs”. But this is precisely what rulial space lets us talk about. What exact “geometry” the “space of strategies” has will depend on how we choose to coordinatize rulial space. But once again there will tend to be a certain level of coarse-graining achieved by looking only at the kinds of things one discusses in game theory—and at this level we can expect that all sorts of standard “structural” game-theoretic results will generically hold.</p>\n<h2 id='personal-notes'>Personal Notes</h2>\n<p>Even as a kid I was never particularly into playing games or doing puzzles. And maybe it’s a sign I was always a bit too much of a scientist. Because just picking specific moves always seemed to me too arbitrary. To get my interest I needed a bigger picture, more of a coherent intellectual story. But now, in a sense, that’s just what the multicomputational approach to games and puzzles that I discuss here is bringing to us. Yes, it’s very “humanizing” to be able think about making particular moves. But the multicomputational approach immediately gives one a coherent global view that, at least to me, is intellectually much more satisfying.</p>\n<p>The explorations I’ve discussed here can be thought of as originating from a single note in<em> </em><em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>. In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond/'>Chapter 5</a> of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I had a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>section where I first introduced multiway systems</a>.

Twenty years passed and I didn’t think much more about this.

Quantum mechanics had always seemed like something mysterious—the abstract result of pure mathematical formalism. But seeing the connection to multiway systems began to suggest that one might actually be able to “understand quantum mechanics” as something that could “mechanically arise” from some concrete underlying structure.</p>\n<p>I started to think about finding ways to explain quantum mechanics at an intuitive level. And for that I needed a familiar analogy: something everyday that one could connect to multiway systems. I immediately thought about games. And in <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/archives/index?i=2020' target=_blank rel=noopener>September 2020 I decided to take a look</a> at games to explore this analogy in more detail. I quickly analyzed games like tic-tac-toe and Nim—as well as simple sliding block puzzles and the Towers of Hanoi. But I wanted to explore more games and puzzles. And I had <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/all-by-date/'>other projects to do</a>, so the multicomputational analysis of games and puzzles got set aside. The Towers of Hanoi reappeared earlier this year, when I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#the-topology-of-proof-space'>used it as an example of generating a proof-like multiway graph</a>, in connection with my study of the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>physicalization of metamathematics</a>. And finally, a few weeks ago I decided it was time to write down what I knew so far about games and puzzles—and produce what’s here.</p>\n<h2 id='thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>Thanks to Brad Klee and Ed Pegg for extensive help in the final stages of the analysis given here—as well as to Christopher Wolfram for inspiration in 2017, and help in 2020.</p>\n",

But what&#8217;s become increasingly clear—particularly in the last few years—is that it&#8217;s actually even much more important than I ever imagined. My <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>original goal</a> in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was to take a step beyond the mathematical paradigm that had defined the state of the art in science for three centuries—and to introduce a new paradigm based on computation and on the exploration of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>computational universe of possible programs</a>. And already in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> one can see that there&#8217;s immense richness to what can be done with this new paradigm. <span id=\"more-36963\"></span></p>\n<p>There’s a new abstract basic science—that I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>now call ruliology</a>—that’s concerned with studying the detailed properties of systems with simple rules. There’s a vast new source of “raw material” to “mine” from the computational universe, both for making models of things and for developing technology. And there are new, computational ways to think about fundamental features of how systems in nature and elsewhere work.</p>\n<p>But what’s now becoming clear is that there’s actually something still bigger, still more overarching that the paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> lays the foundations for. In a sense, <em>A New Kind of Science</em> defines how one can use computation to think about things. But what we’re now realizing is that actually computation is not just a way to think about things: it is at a very fundamental level what everything actually is. </p>\n<p>One can see this as a kind of ultimate limit of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. What we call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a> is the entangled limit of all possible computations. And what we, for example, experience as physical reality is in effect just our particular sampling of the ruliad. And it’s the ideas of <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>and particularly things like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>—that lay the foundations for understanding how this works.</p>\n<p>When I wrote <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>discussed the possibility</a> that there might be a way to find a fundamental model of physics based on simple programs. And from that seed has now come the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>, which, with its broad connections to existing mathematical physics, now seems to show that, yes, it&#8217;s really true that our physical universe is “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>computational all the way down</a>”. </p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s more. It&#8217;s not just that at the lowest level there&#8217;s some specific rule operating on a vast network of atoms of space. It&#8217;s that underneath everything is all possible computation, encapsulated in the single unique construct that is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. And what determines our experience—and the science we use to summarize it—is what characteristics we as observers have in sampling the ruliad. </p>\n<p>There is a tower of ideas that relate to fundamental questions about the nature of existence, and the foundations not only of physics, but also of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>mathematics</a>, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>computer science</a> and a host of other fields. And these ideas build crucially on the paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. But they need something else as well: what I now call the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>. There were hints of it in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> when I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>discussed multiway systems</a>. But it has only been within the past couple of years that this whole new paradigm has begun to come into focus. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I explored some of the remarkable things that individual computations out in the computational universe can do. What the multicomputational paradigm now does is to consider the aggregate of multiple computations—and in the end the entangled limit of all possible computations, the ruliad.</p>\n<p>The Principle of Computational Equivalence is in many ways the intellectual culmination of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>—and it has many deep consequences. And one of them is the idea—and uniqueness—of the ruliad. The Principle of Computational Equivalence provides a very general statement about what all possible computational systems do. What the ruliad then does is to pull together the behaviors and relationships of all these systems into a single object that is, in effect, an ultimate representation of everything computational, and indeed in a certain sense simply of everything. </p>\n<h2 id='the-intellectual-journey:-from-physics-to-physics,-and-beyond'>The Intellectual Journey: From Physics to Physics, and Beyond</h2>\n<p>The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> 20 years ago</a> was for me already the culmination of an <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/'>intellectual journey</a> that had begun more than 25 years earlier. I had started in theoretical physics as a teenager in the 1970s. And stimulated by my needs in physics, I had then <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>built my first computational language</a>. A couple of years later I returned to basic science, now interested in some very fundamental questions. And from my blend of experience in physics and computing I was led to start trying to formulate things in terms of computation, and computational experiments. And soon <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>discovered the remarkable fact</a> that in the computational universe, even very simple programs can generate immensely complex behavior.</p>\n<p>For several years I <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>studied the basic science</a> of the particular class of simple programs known as <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment#sect-2-1--how-do-simple-programs-behave'>cellular automata</a>—and the things I saw led me to identify some important general phenomena, most notably <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>. Then in 1986—having “answered most of the obvious questions I could see”—I left basic science again, and for five years concentrated on <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>creating Mathematica</a> and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. But in 1991 I took the tools I’d built, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>again immersed myself in basic science</a>. The decade that followed brought a long string of exciting and unexpected discoveries about the computational universe and its implications—leading finally in 2002 to the publication of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is a very complete book—that in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/colophon/'>its 1280 pages</a> does well at “answering all the obvious questions”, save, notably, for some about the “application area” of fundamental physics. For a couple of years after the book was published, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#please-dont-do-that-project'>I continued to explore some of these remaining questions</a>. But pretty soon I was swept up in the building of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> and then the Wolfram Language, and in all the complicated and often deep questions involved in for the first time creating a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>full-scale computational language</a>. And so for nearly 17 years I did almost no basic science. </p>\n<p>The ideas of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> nevertheless continued to exert a deep influence—and I came to see my decades of work on computational language as ultimately being about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/'>creating a bridge</a> between the vast capabilities of the computational universe revealed by <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and the specific kinds of ways we humans are able to think about things. This point of view led me to all kinds of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>important conclusions</a> about the role of computation and its implications for the future. But through all this I kept on thinking that one day I should look at physics again. And finally in 2019, stimulated by a small technical breakthrough, as well as enthusiasm from physicists of a new generation, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>I decided it was time to try diving into physics again</a>.</p>\n<p>My <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/'>practical tools</a> had developed a lot since I’d worked on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And—as I have found so often—the passage of years had given me greater clarity and perspective about what I’d discovered in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And it turned out we were rather quickly able to make spectacular progress. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> had <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>introduced definite ideas about how fundamental physics might work</a>. Now we could see that these ideas were very much on the right track, but on their own they did not go far enough. Something else was needed. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d introduced what I called <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a>, but I’d treated them as a kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-11--uniqueness-and-branching-in-time'>sideshow</a>. Now—particularly <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>tipped off by quantum mechanics</a>—we realized that multiway systems were not a sideshow but were actually in a sense the main event. They had come out of the computational paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, but they were really harbingers of a new paradigm: the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I’d already talked about space—and everything else in the universe—ultimately being <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-7--space-as-a-network'>made up of a network of discrete elements</a> that I’d now call “atoms of space”. And I’d talked about time being associated with the inexorable progressive application of computationally irreducible rules. But now we were thinking not just of a single thread of computation, but instead of a whole multiway system of branching and merging threads—representing in effect a multicomputational history for the universe. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d devoted a whole chapter to “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-10--processes-of-perception-and-analysis/'>Processes of Perception and Analysis</a>”, recognizing the importance of the observer in computational systems. But with multicomputation there was yet more focus on this, and on how a physical observer knits things together to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>form a coherent thread of experience</a>. Indeed, it became clear that it’s certain features of the observer that ultimately determine the laws of physics we perceive. And in particular it seems that as soon as we—somehow reflecting core <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>features of our conscious experience</a>—believe that we exist persistently through time, but are computationally bounded, then it follows that we will attribute to the universe the central known laws of spacetime and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>At the level of atoms of space and individual threads of history everything is full of computational irreducibility. But the key point is that observers like us don’t experience this; instead we sample certain computationally reducible features—that we can describe in terms of meaningful “laws of physics”.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/1-inset-phyzA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"163\" height=\"134\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>I never expected it would be so easy, but by early 2020—only a few months into our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>—we seemed to have successfully identified how the “machine code” of our universe must work. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> had established that computation was a powerful way of thinking about things. But now it was becoming clear that actually our whole universe is in a sense “computational all the way down”. </p>\n<p>But where did this leave the traditional mathematical view? To my surprise, far from being at odds it seemed as if our computation-all-the-way-down model of physics perfectly plugged into a great many of the more abstract existing mathematical approaches. Mediated by multicomputation, the concepts of <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>which began as an effort to go beyond mathematics—seemed now to be finding a kind of ultimate convergence with mathematics.</p>\n<p>But despite our success in working out the structure of the “machine code” for our universe, a major mystery remained. Let’s say we could find a particular rule that could generate everything in our universe. Then we’d have to ask “Why this rule, and not another?” And if “our rule” was simple, how come we’d “lucked out” like that? Ever since I was working on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I’d <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/09/my-hobby-hunting-for-our-universe/'>wondered about this</a>.</p>\n<p>And just as we were getting ready to announce the Physics Project in May 2020 the answer <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#why-this-universe-the-relativity-of-rules'>began to emerge</a>. It came out of the multicomputational paradigm. And in a sense it was an ultimate version of it. Instead of imagining that the universe follows some particular rule—albeit applying it multicomputationally in all possible ways—what if the universe follows all possible rules? </p>\n<p>And then we realized: this is something much more general than physics. And in a sense it’s the ultimate computational construct. It’s what one gets if one takes all the programs in the computational universe that I studied in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and runs them together—as a single, giant, multicomputational system. It’s a single, unique object that I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, formed as the entangled limit of all possible computations.</p>\n<p>There’s no choice about the ruliad. Everything about it is abstractly necessary—emerging as it does just from the formal concept of computation. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> developed the abstraction of thinking about things in terms of computation. The ruliad takes this to its ultimate limit—capturing the whole entangled structure of all possible computations—and defining an object that in some sense describes everything.</p>\n<p>Once we believe—as the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies—that things like our universe are computational, it then inevitably follows that they are described by the ruliad. But the observer has a crucial role here. Because while as a matter of theoretical science we can discuss the whole ruliad, our experience of it inevitably has to be based on sampling it according to our actual capabilities of perception.</p>\n<p>In the end, it’s deeply analogous to something that—as <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>I mention in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>—first got me interested in fundamental questions in science 50 years ago: the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>. The molecules in a gas move around and interact according to certain rules. But as <em>A New Kind of Science</em> argues, one can think about this as a computational process, which can show computational irreducibility. If one didn’t worry about the “mechanics” of the observer, one might imagine that one could readily “see through” this computational irreducibility, to the detailed behavior of the molecules underneath. But the point is that a realistic, computationally bounded observer—like us—will be forced by computational irreducibility to perceive only certain “coarse-grained” aspects of what’s going on, and so will consider the gas to be behaving in a standard large-scale thermodynamic way. </p>\n<p>And so it is, at a grander level, with the ruliad. Observers like us can only perceive certain aspects of what’s going on in the ruliad, and a key result of our Physics Project is that with only quite loose constraints on what we’re like as observers, it’s inevitable that we will perceive our universe to operate according to particular precise known laws of physics. And indeed the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>attributes that we associate with “consciousness”</a> seem closely tied to what’s needed to get the features of spacetime and quantum mechanics that we know from physics. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> one of the conclusions is that the Principle of Computational Equivalence <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>implies a fundamental equivalence between systems (like us)</a> that we consider “intelligent” or “conscious”, and systems that we consider “merely computational”. </p>\n<p>But what’s now become clear in the multicomputational paradigm is that there’s more to this story. It’s not (as people have often assumed) that there’s something more powerful about “conscious observers” like us. Actually, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>it&#8217;s rather the opposite</a>: that in order to have consistent “conscious experience” we have to have certain limitations (in particular, computational boundedness, and a belief of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/'>persistence in time</a>), and these limitations are what make us “see the ruliad” in the way that corresponds to our usual view of the physical world.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 7px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/2-inset-ultimate-universe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"131\" height=\"117\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad is a powerful one, with implications that significantly transcend the traditional boundaries of science. For example, last year I realized that thinking in terms of the ruliad potentially provides a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>meaningful answer to the ultimate question of why our universe exists</a>. The answer, I posit, is that the ruliad—as a “purely formal” object—“necessarily exists”. And what we perceive as “our universe” is then just the “slice” that corresponds to what we can “see” from the particular place in “rulial space” at which we happen to be. There has to be “something there”—and the remarkable fact is that for an observer with our general characteristics, that something has to have features that are like our usual laws of physics.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I discussed how the Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-10--intelligence-in-the-universe'>almost any system can be thought of as being “like a mind”</a> (as in, “the weather has a mind of its own”). But the issue—that for example is of central importance in talking about extraterrestrial intelligence—is how similar to us that mind is. And now with the ruliad we have a more definite way to discuss this. Different minds (even different human ones) can be thought of as being at different places in the ruliad, and thus in effect attributing different rules to the universe. The Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that there must ultimately be a way to translate (or, in effect, move) from one place to another. But the question is how far it is. </p>\n<p>Our senses and measuring devices—together with our general paradigms for thinking about things—define the basic area over which our understanding extends, and for which we can readily produce a high-level narrative description of what’s going on. And in the past we might have assumed that this was all we’d ever need to reach with whatever science we built. But what <em>A New Kind of Science—</em>and now the ruliad—show us is that there’s much more out there. There’s a whole computational universe of possible programs—many of which behave in ways that are far from our current domain of high-level understanding.</p>\n<p>Traditional science we can view as operating by gradually expanding our domain of understanding. But in a sense the key methodological idea that launched <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is to do computational experiments, which in effect just “jump without prior understanding” out into the wilds of the computational universe. And that’s in the end why <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>all that ruliology</a> in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> at first looks so alien: we’ve effectively jumped quite far from our familiar place in rulial space, so there’s no reason to expect we’ll recognize anything. And in effect, as the title of the book says, we need to be doing a new kind of science.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, an important part of the story has to do with the phenomenon of computational irreducibility, and the way in which it prevents any computationally bounded observer (like us) from being able to “reduce” the behavior of systems, and thereby perceive them as anything other than complex. But now that we’re thinking not just about computation, but about multicomputation, other attributes of other observers start to be important too. And with the ruliad ultimately representing everything, the question of what will be perceived in any particular case devolves into one about the characteristics of observers.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I give examples of how the same kinds of simple programs (such as cellular automata) can <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>provide good “metamodels” for a variety of kinds of systems</a> in nature and elsewhere, that show up in very different areas of science. But one feature of different areas of science is that they’re often concerned with different kinds of questions. And with the focus on the characteristics of the observer this is something we get to capture—and we get to discuss, for example, what the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemical observer</a>, or the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economic observer</a>, might be like, and how that affects their perception of what’s ultimately in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>In <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Chapter 12 of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> there’s a long section on “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-9--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations'>Implications for Mathematics and Its Foundations</a>”, which begins with the observation that just as many models in science seem to be able to start from simple rules, mathematics is traditionally specifically set up to start from simple axioms. I then analyzed how <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>multiway systems could be thought of as defining possible derivations</a> (or proofs) of new mathematical theorems from axioms or other theorems—and I discussed how the difficulty of doing mathematics can be thought of as a reflection of computational irreducibility.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-inset-metamath-project.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"123\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But informed by our Physics Project I realized that there&#8217;s much more to say about the foundations of mathematics—and this has led to our recently launched <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>Metamathematics Project</a>. At the core of this project is the idea that mathematics, like physics, is ultimately just a sampling of the ruliad. And just as the ruliad defines the lowest-level machine code of physics, so does it also for mathematics.</p>\n<p>The traditional axiomatic level of mathematics (with its built-in notions of variables and operators and so on) is already higher level than the “raw ruliad”. And a crucial observation is that just like physical observers operate at a level far above things like the atoms of space, so “mathematical observers” mostly operate at a level far above the raw ruliad, or even the “assembly code” of axioms. In an analogy with gases, the ruliad—or even axiom systems—are talking about the “molecular dynamics” level; but “mathematical observers” operate more at the “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>And the result of this is what I call the physicalization of metamathematics: the realization that our “perception” of mathematics is like our perception of physics. And that, for example, the very possibility of consistently doing higher-level mathematics where we don&#8217;t always have to drop down to the level of axioms or the raw ruliad has the same origin as the fact that “observers like us” typically view space as something continuous, rather than something made up of lots of atoms of space.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p815--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>considered it a mystery</a> why phenomena like undecidability are not more common in typical pure mathematics. But now our Metamathematics Project provides an answer that&#8217;s based on the character of mathematical observers. </p>\n<p>My stated goal at the beginning of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was to go beyond the mathematical paradigm, and that&#8217;s exactly what was achieved. But now there&#8217;s almost a full circle—because we see that building on <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and the computational paradigm we reach the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, and then we realize that mathematics, like physics, is part of the ruliad. Or, put another way, mathematics, like physics—and like everything else—is “made of computation”, and all computation is in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>And that means that insofar as we consider there to be physical reality, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>so also we must consider there to be “mathematical reality”</a>. Physical reality arises from the sampling of the ruliad by physical observers; so similarly mathematical reality must arise from the sampling of the ruliad by mathematical observers. Or, in other words, if we believe that the physical world exists, so we must—essentially like Plato—also believe that the mathematics exists, and that there is an underlying reality to mathematics.</p>\n<p>All of these ideas rest on what was achieved in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> but now go significantly beyond it. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#the-lost-epilog,-and-other-outtakes-from-the-book'>In an “Epilog” that I eventually cut</a> from the final version of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I speculated that “major new directions” might be built in 15–30 years. And when I wrote that, I wasn&#8217;t really expecting that I would be the one to be central in doing that. And indeed I suspect that had I simply continued the direct path in basic science defined by my work on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, it wouldn&#8217;t have been me. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve explicitly planned, but at this point I can look back on my life so far and see it as a repeated alternation between <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/my-life-in-technology-as-told-at-the-computer-history-museum/'>technology</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>basic science</a>. Each builds on the other, giving me both ideas and tools—and creating in the end a taller and taller intellectual tower. But what&#8217;s crucial is that every alternation is in many ways a fresh start, where I&#8217;m able to use what I&#8217;ve done before, but have a chance to reexamine everything from a new perspective. And so it has been in the past few years with <em>A New Kind of Science</em>: having returned to basic science after 17 years away, it&#8217;s been possible to make remarkably rapid and dramatic progress that&#8217;s taken things to a new and wholly unexpected level. </p>\n<h2 id='the-arrival-of-a-fourth-scientific-paradigm'>The Arrival of a Fourth Scientific Paradigm</h2>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/4-inset-opening-sentence.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"124\" height=\"149\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In the course of intellectual history, there’ve been <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>very few fundamentally different paradigms</a> introduced for theoretical science. The first is what one might call the “structural paradigm”, in which one’s basically just concerned with what things are made of. And beginning in antiquity—and continuing for two millennia—this was pretty much the only paradigm on offer. But in the 1600s there was, as I described it in the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>opening sentence of<em> A New Kind of Science</a></em>, a “dramatic new idea”—that one could describe not just how things are, but also what they can do, in terms of mathematical equations.</p>\n<p>And for three centuries this “mathematical paradigm” defined the state of the art for theoretical science. But as I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas/'>went on to explain in the opening paragraph of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, my goal was to develop a new “computational paradigm” that would describe things not in terms of mathematical equations but instead in terms of computational rules or programs. There’d been <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-1--the-foundations-for-a-new-kind-of-science#sect-1-4--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book'>precursors to this in my own work in the 1980s</a>, but despite the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>practical use of computers in applying the mathematical paradigm</a>, there wasn’t much of a concept of describing things, say in nature, in a fundamentally computational way.</p>\n<p>One feature of a mathematical equation is that it aims to encapsulate “in one fell swoop” the whole behavior of a system. Solve the equation and you’ll know everything about what the system will do. But in the computational paradigm it’s a different story. The underlying computational rules for a system in principle determine what it will do. But to actually find out what it does, you have to run those rules—which is often a computationally irreducible process. </p>\n<p>Put another way: in the structural paradigm, one doesn’t talk about time at all. In the mathematical paradigm, time is there, but it’s basically just a parameter, that if you can solve the equations you can set to whatever value you want. In the computational paradigm, however, time is something more fundamental: it’s associated with the actual irreducible progression of computation in a system.</p>\n<p>It’s an important distinction that cuts to the core of theoretical science. Heavily influenced by the mathematical paradigm, it’s often been assumed that science is fundamentally about being able to make predictions, or in a sense having a model that can “outrun” the system you’re studying, and say what it’s going to do with much less computational effort than the system itself. </p>\n<p>But <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a> implies that there’s a fundamental limit to this. There are systems whose behavior is in effect “too complex” for us to ever be able to “find a formula for it”. And this is not something we could, for example, resolve just by increasing our mathematical sophistication: it is a fundamental limit that arises from the whole structure of the computational paradigm. In effect, from deep inside science we’re learning that there are <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-12--historical-perspectives'>fundamental limitations on what science can achieve</a>.</p>\n<p>But as I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-7--the-phenomenon-of-free-will'>mentioned in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, computational irreducibility has an upside as well. If everything were computationally reducible, the passage of time wouldn’t in any fundamental sense add up to anything; we’d always be able to “jump ahead” and see what the outcome of anything would be without going through the steps, and we’d never have something we could reasonably experience as free will.</p>\n<p>In practical computing it’s pretty common to want to go straight from “question” to “answer”, and not be interested in “what happened inside”. But in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> there is in a sense an immediate emphasis on “what happens inside”. I don’t just show the initial input and final output for a cellular automaton. I show its whole “spacetime” history. And now that we have a computational theory of fundamental physics we can see that all the richness of our physical experience is contained in the “process inside”. We don’t just want to know the endpoint of the universe; we want to live the ongoing computational process that corresponds to our experience of the passage of time.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/5-inset-multicomp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"144\" height=\"128\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But, OK, so in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> we reached what we might identify as the third major paradigm for theoretical science. But the exciting—and surprising—thing is that inspired by our Physics Project we can now <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>see a fourth paradigm: the multicomputational paradigm</a>. And while the computational paradigm involves considering the progression of particular computations, the multicomputational paradigm involves considering the entangled progression of many computations. The computational paradigm involves a single thread of time. The multicomputational paradigm involves multiple threads of time that branch and merge.</p>\n<p>What in a sense forced us into the multicomputational paradigm was <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>thinking about quantum mechanics in our Physics Project</a>, and realizing that multicomputation was inevitable in our models. But the idea of multicomputation is vastly more general, and in fact immediately applies to any system where at any given step multiple things can happen. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I studied many kinds of computational systems—like cellular automata and Turing machines—where one definite thing happens at each step. I looked a little at <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-6--multiway-systems'>multiway systems</a>—primarily ones based on string rewriting. But now in general in the multicomputational paradigm one is interested in studying multiway systems of all kinds. They can be based on simple iterations, <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>say involving numbers</a>, in which multiple functions can be applied at each step. They can be based on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#he-topology-of-proof-space'>systems like games</a> where there are multiple moves at each step. And they can be based on a whole range of systems in nature, technology and elsewhere where there are multiple <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/#asynchronous-updating'>“asynchronous” choices of events</a> that can occur.</p>\n<p>Given the basic description of multicomputational systems, one might at first assume that whatever difficulties there are in deducing the behavior of computational systems, they would only be greater for multicomputational systems. But the crucial point is that whereas with a purely computational system (like a cellular automaton) it’s perfectly reasonable to imagine “experiencing” its whole evolution—say just by seeing a picture of it, the same is not true of a multicomputational system. Because for observers like us, who fundamentally experience time in a single thread, we have no choice but to somehow “sample” or “coarse grain” a multicomputational system if we are to reduce its behavior to something we can “experience”. </p>\n<p>And there’s then a remarkable formal fact: if one has a system that shows fundamental computational irreducibility, then computationally bounded “single-thread-of-time” observers inevitably perceive certain effective behavior in the system, that follows something like the typical laws of physics. Once again we can make an analogy with gases made from large numbers of molecules. Large-scale (computationally bounded) observers will essentially inevitably perceive gases to follow, say, the standard gas laws, quite independent of the detailed properties of individual molecules. </p>\n<p>In other words, the interplay between an “observer like us” and a multicomputational system will effectively select out a slice of computational reducibility from the underlying computational irreducibility. And although I didn’t see this coming, it’s in the end fairly obvious that something like this has to happen. The Principle of Computational Equivalence makes it basically inevitable that the underlying processes in the universe will be computationally irreducible. But somehow the particular features of the universe that we perceive and care about have to be ones that have enough computational reducibility that we can, for example, make consistent decisions about what to do, and we’re not just continually confronted by irreducible unpredictability.</p>\n<p>So how general can we expect this picture of multicomputation to be, with its connection to the kinds of things we’ve seen in physics? It seems to be extremely general, and to provide a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>true fourth paradigm for theoretical science</a>. </p>\n<p>There are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>many kinds of systems</a> for which the multicomputational paradigm seems to be immediately relevant. Beyond physics and metamathematics, there seems to be near-term promise in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemistry</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular biology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#evolutionary-biology'>evolutionary biology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#neuroscience'>neuroscience</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#immunology'>immunology</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics'>linguistics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economics</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#machine-learning'>machine learning</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#distributed-computing'>distributed computing</a> and more. In each case there are underlying low-level elements (such as molecules) that interact through some kind of events (say collisions or reactions). And then there’s a big question of what the relevant observer is like.</p>\n<p>In <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>chemistry</a>, for example, the observer could just measure the overall concentration of some kind of molecule, coarse-graining together all the individual instances of those molecules. Or the observer could be sensitive, for example, to detailed causal relationships between collisions among molecules. In traditional chemistry, things like this generally aren’t “observed”. But in biology (for example in connection with membranes), or in molecular computing, they may be crucial. </p>\n<p>When I began the project that became <em>A New Kind of Science</em> the central question I wanted to answer is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>why we see so much complexity</a> in so many kinds of systems. And with the computational paradigm and the ubiquity of computational irreducibility we had an answer, which also in a sense told us why it was difficult to make certain kinds of progress in a whole range of areas.</p>\n<p>But now we’ve got a new paradigm, the multicomputational paradigm. And the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#multicomputation-and-the-surprise-return-of-reducibility-'>big surprise</a> is that through the intermediation of the observer we can tap into computational reducibility, and potentially find “physics-like” laws for all sorts of fields. This may not work for the questions that have traditionally been asked in these fields. But the point is that with the “right kind of observer” there’s computational reducibility to be found. And that computational reducibility may be something we can tap into for understanding, or to use some kind of system for technology.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/6-inset-ruliad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"121\" height=\"126\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>It can all be seen as starting with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, and involving almost philosophical questions of what one can call “observer theory”. But in the end it gives us very practical ideas and methods that I think have the potential to lead to unexpectedly dramatic progress in a remarkable range of fields.</p>\n<p>I knew that <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would have practical applications, particularly in modeling, in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#a-world-of-discovered-technology'>technology</a> and in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2011/06/music-mathematica-and-the-computational-universe/'>producing creative material</a>. And indeed it has. But for our Physics Project applications seemed much further away, perhaps centuries. But a great surprise has been that through the multicomputational paradigm it seems as if there are going to be some quite immediate and very practical applications of the Physics Project.</p>\n<p>In a sense the reason for this is that through the intermediation of multicomputation we see that many kinds of systems share the same underlying “metastructure”. And this means that as soon as there are things to say about one kind of system these can be applied to other systems. And in particular the great successes of physics can be applied to a whole range of systems that share the same multicomputational metastructure.</p>\n<p>An immediate example is in practical computing, and particularly in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. It’s something of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/#the-beginning-of-the-story'>personal irony</a> that the Wolfram Language is based on transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which is a structure very similar to what ends up being what’s involved in the Physics Project. But there’s a crucial difference: in the usual case of the Wolfram Language, everything works in a purely computational way, with a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#the-question-of-evaluation-order'>particular transformation being done at each step</a>. But now there’s the potential to generalize that to the multicomputational case, and in effect to trace the multiway system of every possible transformation.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to pick out of that structure things that we can readily understand. But there are important lessons from physics for this. And as we build out the multicomputational capabilities of the Wolfram Language I fully expect that the “notational clarity” it will bring will help us to formulate much more in terms of the multicomputational paradigm.</p>\n<p>I built the Wolfram Language as a tool that would help me explore the computational paradigm, and from that paradigm there emerged principles like the Principle of Computational Equivalence, which in turn led me to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2009/05/7-years-of-nks-and-its-first-killer-app/'>see the possibility</a> of something like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>. But now from the latest basic science built on the foundations of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, together with the practical tooling of the Wolfram Language, it’s becoming possible again to see how to make conceptual advances that can drive technology that will again in turn let us make—likely dramatic—progress in basic science. </p>\n<h2 id='harvesting-seeds-from-a-new-kind-of-science'>Harvesting Seeds from A New Kind of Science</h2>\n<p><em>A New Kind of Science</em> is full of intellectual seeds. And in the past few years—having now returned to basic science—I’ve been harvesting a few of those seeds. The <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> and the Metamathematics Project are two major results. But there’s been quite a bit more. And in fact it’s rather remarkable how many things that were barely more than footnotes in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/new-kind-of-science/'>turned into major projects</a>, with important results.</p>\n<p>Back in 2018—a year before beginning the Physics Project—I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>returned, for example,</a> to what’s become known as the Wolfram Axiom: the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p808--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>axiom that I found in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> that is the very simplest possible axiom for Boolean algebra. But my focus now was not so much on the axiom itself as on the automated process of proving its correctness, and the effort to see the relation between “pure computation” and what one might consider a human-absorbable “narrative proof”.</p>\n<p>Computational irreducibility appeared many times, notably in my efforts to understand <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>AI ethics</a> and the implications of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>computational contracts</a>. I’ve no doubt that in the years to come, the concept of computational irreducibility will become increasingly important in everyday thinking—a bit like how concepts such as energy and momentum from the mathematical paradigm have become important. And in 2019, for example, computational irreducibility made an <a href='https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/6/optimizing-for-engagement-understanding-the-use-of-persuasive-technology-on-internet-platforms' target=_blank rel=noopener>appearance in government affairs</a>, as a result of me <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/06/testifying-at-the-senate-about-a-i-selected-content-on-the-internet/'>testifying about its implications for legislation about AI selection</a> of content on the internet.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I explored many specific systems about which one can ask all sorts of questions. And one might think that after 20 years “all the obvious questions” would have been answered. But they have not. And in a sense the fact that they have not is a direct reflection of the ubiquity of computational irreducibility. But it’s a fundamental feature that whenever there’s computational irreducibility, there must also be pockets of computational reducibility: in other words, the very existence of computational irreducibility implies an infinite frontier of potential progress. </p>\n<p>Back in 2007, we’d had great success with our <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/'>Turing Machine Prize</a>, and the Turing machine that I’d suspected was the very simplest possible universal Turing machine was <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2007/10/24/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/'>indeed proved universal</a>—providing another piece of evidence for the Principle of Computational Equivalence. And in a sense there’s a general question that’s raised by <em>A New Kind of Science</em> about where the threshold of universality—or computational equivalence—really is in different kinds of systems.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-left: 8px; margin-top: 2px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/7-inset-rule30prize.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"140\" height=\"116\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>But there are simpler-to-define questions as well. And ever since I <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/statistical-mechanics-cellular-automata.pdf'>first studied rule 30</a> in 1984 I’d wondered about many questions related to it. And in October 2019 I decided to launch the <a href='https://www.rule30prize.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Rule 30 Prizes</a>, defining <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/announcing-the-rule-30-prizes'>three specific easy-to-state questions about rule 30</a>. So far I don’t know of progress on them. And for all I know they’ll be open problems for centuries. From the point of view of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a> we can think of them as distant explorations in rulial space, and the question of when they can be answered is like the question of when we’ll have the technology to get to some distant place in physical space.</p>\n<p>Having launched the Physics Project in April 2020, it was rapidly clear that its ideas could also be applied to metamathematics. And it even seemed as if it might be easier to make relevant “real-world” observations in metamathematics than in physics. And the seed for this was in a note in <em>A New Kind of Science</em> entitled “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--empirical-metamathematics/'>Empirical Metamathematics</a>”. That note contained one picture of the theorem-dependency graph of Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>, which in the summer of 2020 <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>expanded into a 70-page study</a>. And in my recent “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>Physicalization of Metamathematics</a>” there’s a continuation of that—beginning to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#empirical-metamathematics'>map out empirical metamathematical space</a>, as explored in the practice of mathematics, with the idea that multicomputational phenomena that in physics may take technically infeasible particle accelerators or telescopes might actually be within reach.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float:left;padding: 0px;margin: 0px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 8px;\"><img class=\"bookpost\" title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/8-inset-combinators.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"142\" height=\"139\" style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-left: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>In addition to being the year we launched our Physics Project, 2020 was also the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/'>100th anniversary of combinators</a>—the first concrete formalization of universal computation. In <em>A New Kind of Science</em> I devoted a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p711--universality-in-turing-machines-and-other-systems/'>few pages</a> and some <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-11-12--combinators/'>notes</a> to combinators, but I decided to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>do a deep dive</a> and use both what I’d learned from <em>A New Kind of Science</em> and from the Physics Project to take a new look at them. Among other things the result was another <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#updating-schemes-and-multiway-systems'>application of multicomputation</a>, as well as the realization that even though the S, K combinators from 1920 seemed very minimal, it was possible that <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/06/1920-2020-and-a-20000-prize-announcing-the-s-combinator-challenge/'>S alone might also be universal</a>, though with something different than the usual input &#8594; output “workflow” of computation. </p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science </em>a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-5-6--non-deterministic-systems/'>single footnote mentions multiway Turing machines</a>. And early last year I turned this seed into a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/02/multiway-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>long and detailed study</a> that provides further foundational examples of multicomputation, and explores the question of just what it means to “do a computation” multicomputationally—something which I believe is highly relevant not only for practical distributed computing but also for things like molecular computing.</p>\n<p>In 2021 it was the <a href='https://youtu.be/ultMxODJE7o' target=_blank rel=noopener>centenary of Post tag systems</a>, and again I turned a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-7--tag-systems'>few pages in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> into a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/'>long and detailed study</a>. And what’s important about both this and my study of combinators is that they provide foundational examples (much like cellular automata in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>), which even in the past year or so I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>used multiple times</a> in different projects.</p>\n<p>In mid-2021, yet another <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p339--origins-of-discreteness/'>few-page discussion in <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> turned into a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/'>detailed study of “The Problem of Distributed Consensus”</a>. And once again, this turned out to have a multicomputational angle, at first in understanding the multiway character of possible outcomes, but later with the realization that the formation of consensus is deeply related to the process of measurement and the coarse-graining involved in it—and the fundamental way that observers extract “coherent experiences” from systems.</p>\n<p>In <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, there’s a short note about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-5-6--multiway-systems-based-on-numbers/'>multiway systems based on numbers</a>. And once again, in fall 2021 I expanded on this to produce an <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems/' target=_blank rel=noopener>extensive study of such systems</a>, as a certain kind of very minimal example of multicomputation, that at least in some cases connects with traditional mathematical ideas.</p>\n<p>From the vantage point of multicomputation and our Physics Project it’s interesting to look back at <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and see some of what it describes with more clarity. In the fall of 2021, for example, I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>reviewed what had become of the original goal of &#8220;understanding complexity&#8221;</a>, and what methodological ideas had emerged from that effort. I identified two primary ones, which I called “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>” and “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#metamodeling-and-the-metatheory-of-models'>metamodeling</a>”. Ruliology, as I’ve mentioned above, is my new name for the pure, basic science of studying the behavior of systems with simple rules: in effect, it’s the science of exploring the computational universe.</p>\n<p>Metamodeling is the key to making connections to systems in nature and elsewhere that one wants to study. Its goal is to find the “minimal models for models”. Often there are existing models for systems. But the question is what the ultimate essence of those models is. Can everything be reduced to a cellular automaton? Or a multiway system? What is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems#sect-8-1--issues-of-modelling'>minimal &#8220;computational essence&#8221; of a system</a>? And as we begin to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>apply the multicomputational paradigm to different fields</a>, a key step will be metamodeling. </p>\n<p>Ruliology and metamodeling are in a sense already core concepts in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, though not under those names. Observer theory is much less explicitly covered. And many concepts—like <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graphs</a>, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-relationship-between-graphs-and-the-multiway-causal-graph/' target=_blank rel=noopener>multiway causal graph</a> and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>—have only emerged now, with the Physics Project and the arrival of the multicomputational paradigm. </p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>Multicomputation</a>, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> and the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/metamathematics/'>Metamathematics Project</a> are sowing their own seeds. But there are still many more seeds to harvest even from <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And just as the multicomputational paradigm was not something that I, for one, could foresee from <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, no doubt there will in time be other major new directions that will emerge. But, needless to say, one should expect that it will be computationally irreducible to determine what will happen: a metacontribution of the science to the consideration of its own future. </p>\n<h2 id='the-doing-of-science'>The Doing of Science</h2>\n<p>The creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/'>took me a decade of intense work</a>, none of which saw the light of day until the moment the book was published on May 14, 2002. Returning to basic science 17 years later the world had changed and it was possible for me to adopt a quite different approach, in a sense making the process of doing science as open and incremental as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;float: right;padding: 0px;margin: 0px;\"><img title=\"\" class=\"bookpost\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/9-inset-wolfram-language.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" height=\"126\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s helped that there’s the web, <a href='https://wolframcloud.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>the cloud</a> and <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/livestreams'>livestreaming</a>. But in a sense the most crucial element has been the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>, and its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>character as a full-scale computational language</a>. Yes, I use English to tell the story of what we’re doing. But fundamentally I’m doing science in the Wolfram Language, using it both as a practical tool, and as a medium for organizing my thoughts, and sharing and communicating what I’m doing.</p>\n<p>Starting in 2003, we’ve had an annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Wolfram Summer School</a> at which a long string of talented students have explored ideas based on <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, always through the medium of the Wolfram Language. In the last couple of years we’ve added a <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school/programs/physics/'>Physics track</a>, connected to the Physics Project, and this year we’re adding a Metamathematics track, connected to the Metamathematics Project.</p>\n<p>During the 17 years that I wasn’t focused on basic science, I was doing technology development. And I think it’s fair to say that at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a> over the past 35 years we’ve created a remarkably effective “machine” for doing innovative research and development. Mostly it’s been producing <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/technologies'>technology</a> and <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/products'>products</a>. But one of the very interesting features of the Physics Project and the projects that have followed it is that we’ve been applying the same managed approach to innovation to them that we have been using so successfully for so many years at our company. And I consider the results to be quite spectacular: in a matter of weeks or months I think we’ve managed to deliver what might otherwise have taken years, if it could have been done at all. </p>\n<p>And particularly with the arrival of the multicomputational paradigm there’s quite a challenge. There are a huge number of exceptionally promising directions to follow, that have the potential to deliver revolutionary results. And with our concepts of managed research, open science and broad connection to talent it should be possible to make great progress even fairly quickly. But to do so requires significant scaling up of our efforts so far, which is why we’re now <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/04/weve-got-a-science-opportunity-overload-its-time-to-launch-the-wolfram-institute/'>launching the Wolfram Institute</a> to serve as a focal point for these efforts.</p>\n<p>When I think about <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I can’t help but be struck by all the things that had to align to make it possible. My early experiences in science and technology, the personal environment I’d created—and the tools I built. I wondered at the time whether the five years I took “away from basic science” to <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>launch Mathematica</a> and what’s now the Wolfram Language might have slowed down what became <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. Looking back I can say that the answer was definitively no. Because without the Wolfram Language the creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would have needed “not just a decade”, but likely more than a lifetime. </p>\n<p>And a similar pattern has repeated now, though even more so. The Physics Project and everything that has developed from it has been made possible by a tower of specific circumstances that stretch back nearly half a century—including my 17-year hiatus from basic science. Had all these circumstances not aligned, it is hard to say when something like the Physics Project would have happened, but my guess is that it would have been at least a significant part of a century away. </p>\n<p>It is a lesson of the history of science that the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/05/living-a-paradigm-shift-looking-back-on-reactions-to-a-new-kind-of-science/'>absorption of major new paradigms</a> is a slow process. And normally the timescales are long compared to the 20 years since <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was published. But in a sense we’ve managed to jump far ahead of schedule with the Physics Project and with the development of the multicomputational paradigm. Five years ago, when I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/'>summarized the first 15 years of <em>A New Kind of Science</a></em> I had no idea that any of this would happen. </p>\n<p>But now that it has—and with all the methodology we’ve developed for getting science done—it feels as if we have a certain obligation to see just what can be achieved. And to see just what can be built in the years to come on the foundations laid down by <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. </p>\n",

Almost every day of my thirties, and a little beyond, I tenaciously worked on it. Figuring out more and more science. Developing new kinds of computational diagrams. Crafting an exposition that I wrote and rewrote to make as clear as possible. And painstakingly laying out page after page of what on May 14, 2002, would be published as <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>.</p>\n<p>I’ve written before (even <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>in the book itself</a>) about the intellectual journey involved in the creation of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. But here I want to share some of the more practical “behind the scenes” journey of the making of what I and others usually now call simply “the NKS book”. Some of what I’ll talk about happened twenty years ago, some more like thirty years ago. And it’s been interesting to go back into my archives (and, yes, those backup tapes from 30 years ago were hard to read!) and relive some of what finally led to the delivery of the ideas and results of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> as truckloads of elegantly printed books with striking covers.<span id=\"more-36459\"></span></p>\n<p>It was late 1989—soon after my 30th birthday—when I decided to embark on what would become <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And at first my objective was quite modest: I just wanted to write a book to summarize the science I’d developed earlier in the 1980s. <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>We&#8217;d released Version 1.0</a> of <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> (and what’s now the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>) in June 1988, and to accompany that release I’d written what had rapidly become a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>very successful book</a>. And while I’d basically built Mathematica to give me the opportunity to do more science, my thought in late 1989 was that before seriously embarking on that, I should spend perhaps a year and write a book about what I already knew, and perhaps tie up a few loose ends in the process.</p>\n<p>My journey in science began in the early 1970s—and by the time I was 14 I’d already written <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/early-books/'>three book-length &#8220;treatises&#8221; about physics</a> (though these wouldn’t see the light of day for several more decades). I worked purely on physics for a number of years, but in 1979 this led me into my <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/smp-symbolic-manipulation-program/'>first big adventure in technology</a>—thereby starting my (very productive) long-term personal pattern of alternating between science and technology (roughly five times so far). In the early 1980s—back in a “science phase”—I was fortunate enough to make what remains my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>all-time favorite science discovery</a>: that in cellular automaton programs even with extremely simple rules it’s possible to generate immense complexity. And from this discovery I was led to a series of results that began to suggest what I started calling a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/'>general &#8220;science of complexity&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>By the mid-1980s I was quite well positioned in the academic world, and my first thought was to try to build up the study of the “science of complexity” as an academic field. I <a href='https://www.complex-systems.com/'>started a journal</a> and a research center, and collected my papers in a book entitled <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1986-a-first-collection-of-cellular-automaton-papers/'>Theory and Applications of Cellular Automata</a></em> (later reissued as <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>Cellular Automata and Complexity</a></em>). But things developed slowly, and eventually I decided to go to “plan B”—and just try to create the tools and environment that I would need to personally push forward the science as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>The result was that in late 1986 I started the development of Mathematica (and what’s now the Wolfram Language) and founded <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>. For several years I was completely consumed with the challenges of language design, software development and CEOing our rapidly growing company. But in August 1989 we had released <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/quick-revision-history.html'>Mathematica 1.2</a> (tying up the most obvious loose ends of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v1/'>Version 1.0</a>)—and with the intensity of my other commitments at least temporarily reduced, I began to think about science again. </p>\n<p><em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>The Mathematica Book</a></em> had been comparatively straightforward and fast for me to write—even as a “side project” to architecting and developing the system. And I imagined that it would be a somewhat similar experience writing a book explaining what I’d figured out about complexity.</p>\n<p>My first working title was <em>Complexity: An Introduction to the Science of Complex Phenomena</em>. My first draft of a table of contents, from November 1989, begins with “A Gallery of Complex Systems” (or “The Phenomenon of Complexity”), and continues through nine other chapters, capturing some of what I then thought would be important (and in most cases had already studied):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg2.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg2.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"402\" /></a></p>\n<p>I wrote a few pages of introductory text—beginning by stating the objective as:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"78\" /></a></p>\n<p>My archives record that in late December I was taking a more computation-first approach, and considering the title <em>Algorithms in Nature: An Introduction to Complexity</em>. But soon I was submerged in the intense effort to develop Mathematica 2.0, and this is what consumed me for most of 1990—though my archives from the time reveal one solitary short note, apparently from the middle of the year: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3-a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg3-a.png\" width=\"396\" height=\"278\" /></a></p>\n<p>But through all this I kept thinking about the book I intended to write, and wondering what it should really be like. In the late 1980s there’d been quite a run of unexpectedly successful “popular science” books—like <em>A Brief History of Time</em>—that mixed what were at least often claimed to be new results or new insights about science with a kind of intended-to-entertain “everyman narrative”. A sequence of publishers had encouraged me to “write a popular science book”. But should the book I was planning to write really be one of those? </p>\n<p>I talked to quite a few authors and editors. But nobody could quite tell a coherent story. Perhaps the most promising insight came from an editor of several successful such books, who opined that he thought the main market for “popular science” books was people who in the past would have read philosophy books, but now those were too narrow and technical. Other people, though, told me they thought it was really more of an “internal market”, with the books basically being bought by other scientists. And in the media and elsewhere there continued to be an undercurrent of sentiment that while the books might be being bought, they mostly weren’t actually getting read.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t there actual data on what’s going on?” I asked my publishing industry contacts. “No”, they said, “that’s just not how our industry works”. “Well”, I said, “why don’t we collect some data?” My then-publisher seemed enthusiastic about it. So I wrote a rather extensive survey to do on “random shoppers” in bookstores. It began with some basic—if “1990-style”—demographic questions, then got to things like</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322bpplsurvey4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img title=\"\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"801\" /></a></p>\n<p>and rather charmingly ended with</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4-a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322Aimg4-a.png\" width=\"501\" height=\"396\" /></a></p>\n<p>(and, yes, in reality it took almost the longest time I could imagine for electronic books to become common). But after many months of “we’ll get results soon” it turned out almost no surveys were ever done. As I would learn repeatedly, most publishers seemed to have a very hard time doing anything they hadn’t already done before. Still, my then-publisher had done well with <em>The Mathematica Book</em>. So perhaps they might be able to just “follow a formula” and do well with my book if it was written in “popular science” form. </p>\n<p>But I quickly realized that the pressure to add sensationalism “to sell books” really grated on me. And it didn’t take long to decide that, no, I wasn’t going to write a “formula” popular science book. I was going to write my own kind of book—that was more direct and straightforward. No stories. Just science. With lots of pictures. And if nothing else, the book would at least be helpful to me, as a way of clarifying my own thinking.</p>\n<h2 id='beginning-to-tool-up'>Beginning to Tool Up</h2>\n<p>In January 1991 we announced <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1991-mathematica-2-is-released/?iframe=true'>Mathematica 2.0</a>—and in March and June I did a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1991/03/03/mathematica2-tour-thumb/?iframe=true'>35-city tour of the US and Europe</a> talking about it. Then, finally, at the beginning of July we delivered final floppy disks to the duplicator (as one did in those days)—and Mathematica 2.0 was on its way. So what next? I had a long roadmap of things we should do. But I decided it was time to let the team I’d built just get on with following the roadmap for a while, without me adding yet more things to it. (As it turns out, we finally finished essentially everything that was on my 1991 to-do list just a few years ago.)</p>\n<p>And so it was that in July 1991 I became a remote CEO (yes, a few decades ahead of the times), moved a couple thousand miles away from our company headquarters to a place in the hills near San Francisco, and set about getting ready to write. Based on the plan I had for the book—and my experience with <em><a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>The Mathematica Book</a></em>—I figured it might take about a year, or maybe 18 months, to finish the project.</p>\n<p>In the end—with a few trips in the middle, notably to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/08/when-exactly-will-the-eclipse-happen-a-multimillenium-tale-of-computation/\">see</a> a <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=total+solar+eclipse+1991'>total solar eclipse</a>—it took me a couple of months to get my remote-CEO setup figured out (with a swank computer-connected fax machine, email getting autodelivered every 15 minutes, etc.). But even while that was going on, I was tooling up to get an efficient modern system for visualizing and studying cellular automata. Back when I had been writing my <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata/'>papers in the 1980s</a>, I’d had a C program (primarily for Sun workstations) that had gradually grown, and was eventually controlled by a rather elaborate—but sensible-for-its-time—hierarchical textual menu system</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" /></a></p>\n<p>which, yes, could generate at least single-graphic-per-screen graphics, as in this picture of my 1983 office setup:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5c.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5c.png\" width=\"556\" height=\"329\" /></a></p>\n<p>But now the world had changed, and I had <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica'>Mathematica</a>. And I wanted a nice collection of Wolfram Language functions that could be used as streamlined “primitives” for studying cellular automata. Given all my work on cellular automata it might seem strange that I hadn’t built cellular automaton functionality into the Wolfram Language right from the start. But in addition to being a bit bashful about my personal pet kind of system, I hadn’t been able to see how to “package” all the various different kinds of cellular automata I’d studied into one convenient superfunction—and indeed it took me a decade more of understanding, both of language design and of cellular automata, to work out <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CellularAutomaton.html'>how to nicely do that</a>. And so back in 1991 I just created a collection of add-on functions (or what might today be a paclet) containing the particular functions I needed. And indeed those functions served me well over the course of the development of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>.</p>\n<p>A “staged” screen capture from the time shows my basic working environment:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img5a.png\" width=\"503\" height=\"409\" /></a></p>\n<p>Some printouts from early 1991 give a sense of my everyday experience:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img6.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img6.png\" width=\"607\" height=\"380\" /></a></p>\n<p>And although it&#8217;s now more than 30 years later, I&#8217;m happy to say that we&#8217;ve successfully maintained the compatibility of the Wolfram Language, and those same functions still just run! The .ma format of my Version 2.0 notebooks from 1991 has <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/Developer/ref/NotebookConvert.html'>to be converted to .nb</a>, but then they just open in <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/12/launching-version-13-0-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/'>Version 13</a> (with a bit of automatic style modernization) and I’m immediately “transported back in time” to 1991, with, yes, a very small notebook appropriate for a 1991 rather than a 2022 screen size: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Of course the cellular automata all look the same, but, yes, this notebook looks shockingly similar to ones from our recent <a href='https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram/status/1420206573096513539' target=_blank rel=noopener>cellular automaton NFT-minting event</a>.)</p>\n<p>We’d invented <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/'>notebooks</a> in 1987 to be able to do just the kinds of things I wanted to do for my science project—and I’d been itching to use them. But before 1991 I’d mostly been doing core code development (often in C), or using the elaborate but still textual system we had for authoring <em>The Mathematica Book</em>. And so—even though I’d demoed them many times—I hadn’t had a chance to personally make daily use of notebooks.</p>\n<p>But in 1991, I went all in on notebooks—and have never looked back. When I first started studying cellular automata back in 1981, I’d had to display their output as text. But soon I was able to start using the bitmapped displays of workstation computers, and by 1984 I was routinely printing cellular automaton images in fairly high resolution on a laser printer. But with Mathematica and our notebook technology things got dramatically more convenient—and what had previously often involved laborious work with paper, scissors and tape now became a matter of simple Wolfram Language code in a notebook.</p>\n<p>For almost a decade starting in 1982, my primary computer had been a progressively more sophisticated Sun workstation. But in 1991 I switched to NeXT—mainly to be able to use our notebook interface, which was by then <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1989/04/03/1989_mathematicaarrivesnext-2/?iframe=true'>well developed for NeXT</a> but wasn’t yet ready on X Windows and Sun. (It was also available on Macintosh computers, but at the time those weren’t powerful enough.) </p>\n<p>And here I am in 1991, captured “hiding out” as a remote CEO, with a NeXT in the background, just getting started on the book:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7a.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img7a.png\" width=\"283\" height=\"193\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here’s a picture showing a bit more of the setup, taken in early 1993, during a short period when I was a remote-remote-CEO, with my computer set up in a hotel room:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img8.png\"><img alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img8.png\" width=\"423\" height=\"438\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id='september-1991:-beyond-cellular-automata'>September 1991: Beyond Cellular Automata</h2>\n<p>Throughout the 1980s, I’d used cellular automata—and basically cellular automata alone—as my window into the computational universe. But in August 1991—with my new computational capabilities and new away-from-the-company-to-do-science setup—I decided it’d be worth trying to look at some other systems.</p>\n<p>And I have to say that now, three decades later, I didn’t remember just how suddenly everything happened. But my filesystem records that in successive days at the beginning of September 1991 there I was investigating more and more kinds of systems (.ma’s were “Mathematica notebook” files; .mb’s were the “binary forks” of these files):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img9.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img9.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"308\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/#sect-3-3--mobile-automata'>Mobile automata</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-4--turing-machines'>Turing machines</a>. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-7--tag-systems'>Tag systems</a>. Soon these would be joined by <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs#sect-3-9--register-machines'>register machines</a>, and more. The first examples of these systems tended to have quite simple behavior. But I quickly started searching to see whether these systems—like cellular automata—would be capable of complex behavior, as my 1991 notebooks record:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img13a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img13a.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"618\" /></a></p>\n<p>Often I would run programs overnight, or sometimes for many days. Later I would recruit many computers from around our company, and have them send me mail about their results:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img10-v2.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img10-v2.png\" width=\"404\" height=\"237\" /></a></p>\n<p>But already in September 1991 I was starting to see that, yes, just like cellular automata, all these different kinds of systems, even when their underlying rules were simple, could <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>exhibit highly complex behavior</a>. I think I’d sort of implicitly assumed this would be true. But somehow actually seeing it began to elevate my view of just how general a “science of complexity” one might be able to make.</p>\n<p>There were a few distractions in the fall of 1991. Like in October a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_firestorm_of_1991' target=_blank rel=noopener>large fire</a> came within about half a mile of burning down our house: </p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img11.png\"><img loading='lazy'alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img11.png\" width=\"359\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p>But by the spring of 1992 it was beginning to become clear that there was a very general principle around all this complexity I was seeing. I had <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/undecidability-intractability-theoretical-physics.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>invented the concept of computational irreducibility</a> back in 1984. And I suppose in retrospect I should have seen the bigger picture sooner. But as it was, on a pleasant afternoon (and, no, I haven’t figured out the exact date), I was taking a short break from being in front of my computer, and had wandered outside. And that’s when the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> came to me. Somehow after all those years with cellular automata, and all those months with computer experiments on other systems, I was primed for it. But in the end it all arrived in one moment: the concept, the name, the implications for computational irreducibility. And in the three decades since, it’s been the single most important guiding principle for my intuition. </p>\n<h2 id='what-should-the-pages-look-like?'>What Should the Pages Look Like?</h2>\n<p>I’ve always found it difficult to produce “disembodied content”: right from the beginning I typically need to have a pretty clear idea how what I’m producing will look in the end. So back in 1991 I really couldn’t produce more than a page or two of content for my book without knowing what the book was going to look like.</p>\n<p>“Formula” popular science books tended—for what I later realized were largely economic reasons—to consist mainly of pages of pure text, with at most line drawings, and to concentrate whatever things like photographs they might have into a special collection of “plates” in the middle of the book. For <em>The Mathematica Book</em> we’d developed a definite—very functional—layout, with text, tables and two-column “computer dialogs”:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img14.png\" width=\"612\" height=\"348\" /></a></p>\n<p>For the NKS book I knew I needed something much more visual. And at first I imagined it might be a bit like a high-end textbook, complete with all sorts of structured elements (“Historical Note”, “Methodology”, etc.). </p>\n<p>I asked a talented young designer who had worked on <em>The Mathematica Book</em> (and who, 31 years later, is now a very senior executive at our company) to see what he could come up with. And here, from November 1991, is the very first “look” for the NKS book—with content pretty much just flowed in from the few pages I’d written out in plain text:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img15.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img15.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"743\" /></a></p>\n<p>I knew the book would have images of the kind I’d long produced of cellular automata, and that had appeared in <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>my papers</a> and <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/'>book</a> from the 1980s:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img16.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"1128\" /></a></p>\n<p>But what about “diagrams”? At first we toyed with drawing “textbook-style” diagrams—and produced some samples:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img17a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img17a.png\" width=\"559\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>\n<p>But these seemed to have way too much &#8220;conceptual baggage&#8221;, and when one looks closely at them, it&#8217;s easy to get confused. I wanted something more minimal—where the spotlight was as much as possible on the systems I was studying, not on &#8220;diagrammatic scaffolding&#8221;. And so I tried to develop a &#8220;direct diagramming&#8221; methodology, where each diagram could directly &#8220;explain itself&#8221;—and where every diagram would be readable &#8220;purely visually&#8221;, without words.</p>\n<p>In a typical case I might <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p71--mobile-automata/'>show the behavior of a system (here a mobile automaton)</a>, next to an explicit “visual template” of how its rules operate. The idea then was that even a reader who didn’t understand the bigger story, or any of the technical details, could still “match up templates” and understand what was going on in a particular picture:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img18.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img18.png\" width=\"493\" height=\"277\" /></a></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the project, the diagrams were comparatively simple. But as the project progressed I invented more and more mechanisms for them, until later in the project I was producing very <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p768--undecidability-and-intractability/'>complex &#8220;visually readable&#8221; diagrams like this</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img19.png\" width=\"548\" height=\"325\" /></a></p>\n<p>A crucial point was that all these diagrams were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--pictures-in-the-book/'>being produced algorithmically</a>—with Wolfram Language code. And in fact I was developing the diagrams as an integral part of actually doing the research for the book. It was a lesson I’d learned years earlier: don’t wait until research is “finished” to figure out how to present it; work out the presentation as early as possible, so you can use it to help you actually do the research.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of our first “textbook-like” style for the book was the idea of having additional elements, alongside the “main narrative” of the book. In early layouts we thought about having “Technical Notes”, “Historical Notes”, “Implementation Notes”, etc. But it didn’t take too long to decide that no, that was just going to be too complicated. So we made the decision to have one kind of note, and to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-for-chapters/'>collect all notes at the back of the book</a>.</p>\n<p>And that meant that in the main part of the book we had just two basic elements: text and images (with captions). But, OK, in designing any book a very basic question is: what size and shape will its pages be? <em>The Mathematica Book</em> was squarish—like a typical textbook—so that it accommodated its text-on-the-left code-on-the-right “dialogs”. We knew that the new book should be wide too, to accommodate the kinds of graphics I expected. But that posed a problem.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Mathematica Book</em> ordinary text ran the full width of the page. And that worked OK, because in that book the text was typically broken up by dialogs, tables, etc. In the new book, however, I expected much longer blocks of pure text—which wouldn’t be readable if they ran the full width of the page. But if the text was narrower, then how would the graphics not look like they were awkwardly sticking out? Well, the pages would have to be carefully laid out to appropriately anchor the graphics visually, say to the tops or bottoms of pages. And that was going to make the process of layout much trickier.</p>\n<p>Different pages were definitely going to look different. But there had to be a certain overall consistency. Every graphic was going to have a caption—and actually a caption that was sufficiently self-contained so that people could basically “read the book just by looking at the pictures”. Within the graphics themselves there had to be standards. How should arrays of cells be rendered? To what extent should things have boxes around them, or arrows between them? How big should pictures that emphasized particular features be?</p>\n<p>Some of these standards got implemented basically just by me remembering to follow them. But others were essentially the result of the whole stack of Wolfram Language functions that we built to produce the algorithmic diagrams for the book. At the time, there was some fiddliness to these functions, and to making their output look good—though in later years what we learned from this was used to tune up the general look of built-in graphics in the Wolfram Language. </p>\n<h2 id='the-technology-of-images'>The Technology of Images</h2>\n<p>One of the striking features of the NKS book is the crispness of its pictures. And I think it’s fair to say that this wasn’t easy to achieve—and in the end required a pretty deep dive into the technology of imaging and printing (as I’ll describe more in a later section).</p>\n<p>Back in the 1980s I’d had plenty of pictures of things like cellular automata in <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/cellular-automata'>my papers</a>. And I’d produced them by outputting what amounted to pages of bitmaps on laser printers, then having publishers photographically reproduce the pictures for printing.</p>\n<p>Up to a point the results were OK:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img20.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"198\" /></a></p>\n<p>But for example in 1985 when I wanted a 2000-step picture of rule 30 things got difficult. The computation (which, yes, involves 8 million cells) was <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/random-sequence-generation-cellular-automata.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>done on a prototype Connection Machine parallel computer</a>. And at first the output was generated on a large-format printer that was usually used to print integrated circuit layouts. The result was quite large, and I subsequently laminated pictures like this (and in rolled-up form they served as engaging hiding places for my children when they were very young):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img21.png\" width=\"192\" height=\"311\" /></a></p>\n<p>But when photographically reproduced and printed in a journal the picture definitely wasn’t great:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img22.png\" width=\"357\" height=\"391\" /></a></p>\n<p>And the NKS book provided another challenge as well. While the core of a picture might just be an array of cells like in a cellular automaton, a full algorithmic diagram could contain all sorts of other elements.</p>\n<p>In the end, the NKS book was a beneficiary of an important design decision that we made back in 1987, early in the development of Mathematica. At the time, most graphics were thought about in terms of bitmaps. On whatever device one was using, there was an array of pixels of a certain resolution. And the focus was on rendering the graphics at that resolution. Not everything worked that way, though. And “drawing” (as opposed to “painting”) programs typically created graphics in “vector” form, in which at first primitives like lines and polygons were specified without reference to resolution, and were then converted to bitmaps only when they were displayed.</p>\n<p>The shapes of characters in fonts were something that was often specified—at least at an underlying level—in vector form. There’d been various approaches to doing this, but by 1987 <a href='https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>PostScript</a> was an emerging standard—at least for printing—buoyed by its use in the Apple LaserWriter. The main focus of PostScript was on fonts and text, but the PostScript language also included standard graphics primitives like lines and polygons. </p>\n<p>Back when <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>I had built SMP in 1979–1981</a> we’d basically had to build a separate driver for every different display or printing device we wanted to output graphics on. But in 1987 there was an alternative: just use PostScript for everything. Printer manufacturers were working hard to support PostScript on their printers, but PostScript mostly hadn’t come to screens yet. There was an important exception though: the NeXT computer was set up to have PostScript as its native screen-rendering system. And partly through that, we decided to use PostScript as our underlying way to represent all graphics in Mathematica.</p>\n<p>At a high level, graphics were described with the same <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/SymbolicGraphicsLanguage.html'>symbolic primitives as we use in the Wolfram Language today</a>: <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Line.html'>Line</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Polygon.html'>Polygon</a></tt>, etc. But these were converted internally to PostScript—and even stored in notebooks that way. On the NeXT this was pretty much the end of the story, but on other systems we had to write our own interpreters for at least the subset of PostScript we were using. </p>\n<p>Why was this important to the NKS book? Well, it meant that all graphics could be specified in a fundamentally resolution-independent way. In developing the graphics I could look at them in a notebook on a screen, or I could print them on a standard laser printer. But for the final book the exact same graphics could be printed at much higher resolution—and look much crisper.</p>\n<p>At the time, the standard resolution of a computer screen was 72 dpi (dots per inch) and the resolution of a typical laser printer was 300 dpi. But the typical basic resolution of a book-printing pipeline was more like 2400 dpi. I’ll talk later about the adventure of actually printing the NKS book. But the key point was that because Mathematica’s graphics were fundamentally based on PostScript, they weren’t tied to any particular resolution, so they could in principle make use of whatever resolution was available.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, there were plenty of complicated issues. One had to do with indicating the cells in something like a cellular automaton. Here’s a picture of the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p27--how-do-simple-programs-behave/'>first few steps of rule 30</a>, shown as a kind of “macro bitmap”, with pure black and white cells:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 3px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img1.png\" alt='ArrayPlot' title='ArrayPlot' width='253' height='134' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img1A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1A_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1A_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But often I wanted to indicate the extent of each cell:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img2.png\" alt='ArrayPlot' title='ArrayPlot' width='284' height='140' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051222img2A_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2A_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2A_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And in late 1991 and early 1992 we worried a lot about how to draw the “mesh” between cells. A first thought was just to use a thin black line. But that obviously wouldn’t work, because it wouldn’t separate black cells. And we soon settled on a <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GrayLevel.html'>GrayLevel</a></tt><tt>[.15]</tt> line, which was visible against both black and white. </p>\n<p>But how is such a line printed? If we’re just using black ink, there’s ultimately either black or white at a particular place on the page. But there’s a standard way to achieve the appearance of gray, by changing the local density of black and white. And the typical method used to implement this is (<a href=\"https://writings.internal.stephenwolfram.com/2022/05/the-making-of-a-new-kind-of-science/#how-to-publish-a-book\">as we’ll discuss later</a>) <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-7--halftoning/'>halftoning</a>, in which one renders the “gray” by using black dots of different sizes.</p>\n<p>But by the time one&#8217;s using very thin gray lines, things are getting very tricky. For example, it matters how much the ink on either side of the line spreads—because if it&#8217;s too much it can effectively fill in where the line was supposed to be. We wanted to define standards that we could use throughout the NKS book. And we couldn&#8217;t tell what would happen in the final printed book except by actually trying it, on a real printing press. So already in early 1992 we started doing print tests, trying out different thicknesses of lines and so on. And that allowed us to start setting graphics standards that we could implement in the Wolfram Language code used to make the algorithmic diagrams, that would then flow through to all renderings of those diagrams.</p>\n<p>Back in 1991 we debated quite a bit whether the NKS book should use color. We knew it would be significantly more expensive to print the book in color. But would color allow seriously better communication of information? Two-color cellular automata like rule 30 can be rendered in pure black and white. But over the years I’d certainly made many striking color pictures of cellular automata with more colors. </p>\n<p>Somehow, though, those pictures hadn’t <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/scrapbook/1984-the-business-of-cellular-automata-commemorative-postcards/?iframe=true'>seemed quite as crisp</a> as the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/cellular-automata-from-christmas-1983/?iframe=true'>black and white ones</a>. And there was another issue too, having to do with a problem I’d noticed in the mid-1980s in human visual perception of arrays of colored cells. Somewhat nerdily, I ended up including a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--using-color/'>note about this in the final NKS book</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25.png\" width=\"448\" height=\"299\" /></a></p>\n<p>But the final conclusion was that, yes, the NKS book would be pure black and white. Nowadays—particularly with screen rendering being in many ways more important than print—it’s much easier to do things in color. And, for example, in our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> it’s been very convenient to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/additional-material/appendix-graph-types/' target=_blank rel=noopener>distinguish types of graphs, or nodes in graphs, by color</a>. But for the NKS book I think it was absolutely the right decision to use black and white. Color might have added some nice accents to certain kinds of diagrams. But the clarity—and visual force—of the images in the book was much better served by the perceptual crispness of pure black and white. </p>\n<h2 id='how-to-lay-out-the-book'>How to Lay Out the Book</h2>\n<p>The way most books with complex formats get produced is that first the author creates “disembodied” pieces of content, then a designer or production artist comes in and arranges them on pages. But for the NKS book I wanted something where the process of creation and layout was much more integrated, and where—just as I was directly writing Wolfram Language code to produce images—I could also directly lay out final book pages.</p>\n<p>By 1990 “desktop publishing” was commonplace, and there were plenty of systems that basically allowed one to put anything anywhere on a page. But to make a whole book we knew we needed a more consistent and templated approach—that could also interact programmatically with the Wolfram Language. There were a few well-developed “full-scale book production systems” that existed, but they were complex “industrially oriented” pieces of software, that didn’t seem realistic for me to use interactively while writing the book.</p>\n<p>In mid-1990, though, we saw a demo of something new, running on the NeXT computer: a system called FrameMaker, which featured book-production capabilities, as well as a somewhat streamlined interchange format. Oh, and especially on the NeXT, it handled PostScript graphics well, inserting them “by reference” into documents. By late 1990 we were building book layout templates in FrameMaker, and we soon settled on using that for the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--book-production-system/'>basic production of the book</a>. (Later, to achieve all the effects we wanted, we ended up having to process everything through Wolfram Language, but that’s another story.</p>\n<p>We iterated for a while on the book design, but by the end of 1991 we’d nailed it down, and I started authoring the book. I made images using Mathematica, importing them in “<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/EPS.html'>Encapsulated PostScript</a>” into FrameMaker. And words I typed directly into FrameMaker—in the environment reconstructed here using a virtual machine that we saved from the time of authoring the book:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25a.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322img25a.png\" width=\"570\" height=\"494\" /></a></p>\n<p>I composed every page—not only its content, but also its visual appearance. If I had a cellular automaton to render, and it was going to occupy a certain region on a page, I would pick the number of cells and steps to be appropriate for that region. I was constantly adjusting pictures to make them look good on a given page, or on pairs of facing pages, or along with other nearby pictures, and so on. </p>\n<p>One of the tricky issues was how to refer to pictures from within the text. In technical books, it&#8217;s common to number &#8220;figures&#8221;, so that the text might say &#8220;See Figure 16”. But I wanted to avoid that piece of &#8220;scaffolding&#8221;, and instead always just be able to say things like &#8220;the picture below&#8221;, or &#8220;the picture on the facing page“. It was often quite a puzzle to see how to do this. If a picture was too big, or the text was too small, the picture would get too far ahead, and so on. And I was constantly adjusting things to make everything work.</p>\n<p>I also decided that for elegance I wanted to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--hyphenation/'>avoid ever having to hyphenate words</a> in the text. And quite often I found myself either rewording things, or slightly changing letter spacing, to make things fit, and to avoid things like &#8220;orphaned&#8221; words at the beginnings of lines.</p>\n<p>It was a strange and painstaking process getting each page to look right, and adjusting content and layout together. Sometimes things got a little pathological. I always wanted to fill out pages, and not to leave space at the bottom (oh, and facing pages had to be exactly the same height). And I also tried to start new sections on a new page. But there I was, writing <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond/'>Chapter 5</a>, and trying to end the section on &#8220;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-5--two-dimensions-and-beyond#sect-5-4--substitution-systems-and-fractals'>Substitution Systems and Fractals</a>”—and I had an empty bottom third of a page. What was I to do? I decided to invent a whole new kind of system, that <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p192--substitution-systems-and-fractals/'>appears on page 192</a>, just to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p191--substitution-systems-and-fractals/'>fill out the layout for page 191</a>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/swimg051322img26.png\"><img loading='lazy' alt=\"Click to enlarge\" title=\"Click to enlarge\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/swimg051322img26.png\" width=\"620\" height=\"366\" /></a></p>\n<p>Looking through my archives, I find traces of other examples.

I’d successfully captured pretty much everything I’d known when I started on the book back in 1991, and I’d had three years of good discoveries. But what was still to come was seven years of intense research and writing that would take me much further than I had ever imagined back in 1991—and would end up roughly doubling the length of the book. </p>\n<h2 id='photographs-for-the-book'>Photographs for the Book</h2>\n<p>In 1991 I knew the book I was going to write would have lots of cellular automaton pictures. And I imagined that the main other type of pictures it would contain would be photographs of actual, natural systems. But where was I going to get those photographs from? There was no web with image search back then. We looked at stock photo catalogs, but somehow the kinds of images they had (often oriented towards advertising) were pretty far from what we wanted. </p>\n<p>Over the years, I had collected—albeit a bit haphazardly—quite a few relevant images. But we needed many more. I wanted pictures illustrating both complexity, and simplicity. But the good news was that, as I explained early in the book, both are ubiquitous. So it should be easy to find examples of them—that one could go out and take nice, consistent photographs of. </p>\n<p>And starting in late 1991, that’s just what we did. My archives contain all sorts of negatives and contact prints (yes, this was before digital photography, and, yes, that’s a bolt—intended as an example of simplicity in an artifact):</p>\n<table

(And it was very convenient that this was a plant-related question, because I’m horribly squeamish when it comes to dissecting animals, even for food.)</p>\n<p>Some of what I wanted to photograph was out in the world. But some was also collectible. Ever since I was a kid I had been gradually acquiring interesting shells, fossils, rocks and so on, sometimes “out in the field”, but more often at shops. Working on the NKS book I dramatically accelerated that process. Shells were a particular focus, and I soon got to the point where I had specimens of most of the general kinds with “interesting forms”.

Like when we got an employee of ours who happened to be vacationing in Italy to go to part of an obscure church in rural Italy—and get a photograph of a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--ornamental-art/'>mosaic there from 1226 AD</a> (and, yes, those are our photographer&#8217;s feet):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img34.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img34.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='483' height='321' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section8img34_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='34_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='34_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id='what-should-the-book-be-called?'>What Should the Book Be Called?</h2>\n<p>When I started working on the book in 1991 I saw it as an extension of what I’d done in the 1980s to establish a “science of complexity”. So at first I simply called the book <em>The Science of Complexity</em>, adding the explanatory subtitle <em>A Unified Approach to Complex Behavior in Natural and Artificial Systems</em>. But after a while I began to feel that this sounded a bit stodgy—and like a textbook—so to spruce it up a bit I changed it to <em>A New Science of Complexity</em>, with subtitle <em>Rethinking the Mechanisms of Nature:</em></p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='224' height='298' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Pretty soon, though, I dropped the “New” as superfluous, and the title became <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. I always knew computation was a key part of the story, but as I began to understand more about just what was out there in the computational universe, I started thinking I should capture “computation” in the name of the book, leading to a new idea: <em>Computation and the Complexity of Nature</em>. And for this title I even had a first cover draft made—complete with an eye, added on the theory that human visual perception would draw people to the eye, and thus make them notice the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='347' height='429' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But back in 1992 (and I think it would be different today) people really didn’t understand the term “computation”, and it just made the book sound very technical to them. So back I went to <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. I wasn’t very happy with it, though, and I kept on thinking about alternatives. In August 1992 I prepared a little survey:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='520' height='538' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The results of this survey were—like those of many surveys—inconclusive, and didn’t change my mind about the title. Still, in October 1992 I dashed off an email considering <em>The Inevitable Complexity of Nature and Computation</em>. But 15 minutes later, as I put it, I&#8217;d &#8220;lost interest&#8221; in that, and it was back to <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. </p>\n<p>By 1993, believing that the completion of the book was somehow imminent, we’d started trying to mock up the complete look of the book, including things like the back cover, and cover flaps:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='576' height='448' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The flap copy began: “This book is about a new kind of science that&#8230;”. In the first chapter there was then a section called “The Need for a New Kind of Science”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='578' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As 1993 turned into 1994 I was still working with great intensity on the book, leaving almost no time to be out and about, talking about what I was doing. Occasionally, though, I would run into people and they would ask me what I was working on, and I would say it was a book, titled <em>A Science of Complexity</em>. And when I said that—at least among non-technical people—the reaction was essentially always the same “Oh, that sounds very complicated”. And that would be the end of the conversation.</p>\n<p>By September 1994 this had happened just too many times, and I realized I needed a new title. So I thought to myself &#8220;How would I describe the book?&#8221;. And there it was, right in the flap copy: &#8220;a new kind of science”. I made a quick note on the back of my then business card:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='483' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And soon that was the title: <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. I started trying it out. The reaction was again almost always the same. But now it was “So, what’s new about it?” And that would start a conversation.</p>\n<p>I liked the title a lot. It definitely said what by then I thought the book was about. But there was one thing I didn’t like. It seemed a bit like a “meta title”. OK, so you have a new kind of science. But what is that new kind of science called? What is its name? And why isn’t the book called that?</p>\n<p>I spent countless hours thinking about this. I thought about word roots. I considered comp- (for “computation”), prog- (for “program”), auto- (for “automata”, etc.). I went through Latin and Greek dictionaries, and considered roots like arch- and log- (both way too confusing). I wrote programs to generate “synthetic words” that might evoke the right meaning. I considered names like “algonomics”, “gramistry”, “regulistics” (but not “ruliology”!), and “programistics”—for which I tried to see how its usage might work:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='459' height='625' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section09img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But nothing quite clicked. And in a sense my working title already told me why: I was talking about “a new kind of science”, which involved a new way of thinking, for which there were really no words, because it hadn’t been done before.</p>\n<p>I’d had a certain amount of experience inventing words, for concepts in both science and technology. Sometimes it had gone well, sometimes not so well. And I knew the same was true in general in history. For every “physics” or “economics” or even “cybernetics” there were countless names that had never made it. </p>\n<p>And eventually I decided that even if I could come up with a name, it wasn’t worth the risk. Maybe a name would eventually emerge, and it would be perfectly OK if the “launch book” was called <em>A New Kind of Science</em> (as yet unnamed). Certainly much better than if it gave the new kind of science a definite name, but the name that stuck was different.</p>\n<p>During the writing of <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I didn’t really need to “refer in the third person” to what the book was about. But pretty much as soon as the book was published, there needed to be a name for the intellectual endeavor that the book was about. During the development of the book, some of the people working on its project management had started calling the book by the initials of its title: ANKOS. And that was the seed for the name of its content, which almost immediately became “NKS”.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve returned quite a few times to the question of naming. And very recently I’ve <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>started using the term &#8220;ruliology&#8221;</a> for one of the key pursuits of NKS: exploring the details of what systems based on simple computational rules do. I like the name, and I think it captures well the ethos of the specific scientific activity around studying the consequences of simple rules. But it’s not the whole story of “NKS”. <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is, as its name suggests, about a new kind of science—and a new way of thinking about the kind of thing we imagine science can be about. </p>\n<p>When the book was first published, some people definitely seemed to feel that the strength and simplicity of the title “<em>A New Kind of Science</em>” must claim too much. But twenty years later, I think it’s clear that the title said it right. And it’s charming now when people talk about what’s in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, and how it’s different from other things, and want to find a way to say what it is—and end up <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiOnolbVYs8&#038;t=4727s' target=_blank rel=noopener>finding themselves saying it&#8217;s &#8220;a new kind of science&#8221;</a>. And, yes, that’s why I called the book that!</p>\n<h2 id='the-cover-of-the-book'>The Cover of the Book</h2>\n<p>We started thinking about the cover of the book very early in the project—with the “eye” design being the first candidate. But considering this a bit too surreal, the next candidate designs were more staid.

That would have been interesting. But another 400 pages?</p>\n<h2 id='ten-years-of-writing'>Ten Years of Writing</h2>\n<p>By the end of 1991 the basic concept of what would become <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was fairly clear. At the time, I still thought—as I had in the 1980s—that the best “hook” was the objective of “explaining complexity”. But I perfectly well understood that from an intellectual and methodological point of view the most important part of the story was that I was starting to truly take seriously the notion of computation—and starting to think broadly in a fundamentally computational way. </p>\n<p>But what could be figured out like this? What about systems based on constraints? What about systems that adapt or learn? What about biological evolution? What about fundamental physics? What about the foundations of mathematics? At the outset, I really didn’t know whether my approach would have anything to say about these things. But I thought I should at least try to check each of them out. And what happened was that every time I turned over a (metaphorical) rock it seemed like I discovered a whole new world underneath.</p>\n<p>It was intellectually exciting—and almost addictive. I would get into some new area and think “OK, let me see what I can figure out here, then move on”. But then I would get deeper and deeper into it, and weeks would turn into months, and months would turn into years. At the beginning I would sometimes tell people what I was up to. And they would say “That sounds interesting. But what about X, Y, Z?” And I would think “I might as well try and answer those questions too”. But I soon realized that I shouldn’t be letting myself get distracted: I already had more than enough very central questions to answer.</p>\n<p>And so I decided to pretty much “go hermit” until the book was done. An email I sent on October 1, 1992, summarizes how I was thinking at the time: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='444' height='139' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But that email was right before I discovered yet more kinds of computational systems to explore, and before I’d understood applications to biology, and physics, and mathematics, and so on. </p>\n<p>In the early years of the project I’d had various “I could do that as well” ideas. In 1991 I thought about dashing off an <em>Introduction to Computing</em> book (maybe I should do that now!). In 1992 I had a plan for creating an email directory for the world (a very proto LinkedIn). In 1993 I thought about TIX: “The Information Exchange” (a proto web for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/10/the-new-world-of-notebook-publishing/'>computable documents</a>). </p>\n<p>But thinking even a little about these things basically just showed me how much what I really wanted to do was move forward on the science and the book. I was still energetically remote-CEOing my company. But every day, by mid-evening, I would get down to science, and work on it through much of the night. And pretty much that’s how I spent the better part of a decade. </p>\n<p>My <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/'>personal analytics data</a> of outgoing emails show that during the time I was working on the book I became increasingly nocturnal (I shifted and “stabilized” after the book was finished):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img2temp-v4A.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img2temp-v4A.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='568' height='349' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I had started the NKS book right after the big push to release <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1991/06/02/1991_mathematica2-2/?iframe=true'>Mathematica 2.0</a>. And thinking the book would take a year or maybe 18 months I figured it would be long finished before there was a new version of Mathematica, and another big push was needed. But it was not to be. And while I held off as long as I could, by 1996 there was no choice: I had to jump into finishing Mathematica 3.0.</p>\n<p>From the beginning until now I’ve always been the ultimate architect of what’s now the Wolfram Language. And back in the 1990s my way of defining the specification for the language was to write its documentation, as a book. So getting <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/1996/07/07/1993_itshere-2/?iframe=true'> Mathematica 3.0</a> out required me writing a <a href='https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematica-book/'>new edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</a></em>. And since we were <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v3/'>adding a lot in Version 3</a>, the book was long—eventually clocking in at 1403 pages. And it took me a good part of 1996 to write it.</p>\n<p>But in September 1996, Mathematica 3.0 was released, and I was able to go back to my intense focus on science and the NKS book. In many ways it was exhilarating. With <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> as a tool, I was powering through so much research. But it was difficult stuff. And getting everything right—and as clear as possible—was painstaking, if ultimately deeply satisfying, work. On a good day I might manage to write one page of the book. Other times I might spend many days working out what would end up as just a single paragraph in the notes at the back of the book.</p>\n<p>I kept on thinking “OK, in just a few months it’ll be finished”. But I just kept on discovering more and more. And finding out again and again that sections in the table of contents that I thought would just be “quick notes” actually led to major research projects with all sorts of important and unexpected results. </p>\n<p>A 1995 picture captured my typical working setup:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A year or so later, I had the desk I’m still sitting at today (though not in the same location), and a (rarely used) webcam had appeared:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='333' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A few years after that, the computer monitor was thinner, two young helpers had arrived, and I was looking distinctly unkempt and hermit-like:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='572' height='419' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In 2000 a <a href='https://aguilerahellweg.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>photographer for Forbes</a> captured my “caged scientist” look</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='383' height='469' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>along with a rather nice artistically lit “still life” of my working environment (complete with a “from-the-future” thicker-than-real-life mockup of the NKS book):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='383' height='441' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section12img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But gradually, inexorably, the book got closer and closer to being finished. The floor of my office had been covered with piles of paper, each marked with whatever issue or unfinished section they related to. But by 2001 the piles were disappearing—and by the fall of that year they were all but gone: a visible sign that the book was nearing completion. </p>\n<h2 id='tracking-everything-down:-a-decade-of-scholarship'>Tracking Everything Down: A Decade of Scholarship</h2>\n<p><em>A New Kind of Science</em> is—as its title suggests—a book about new things. But an important part of explaining new things is to provide context for them. And for me a key part of the context for things is always the story of what led to them. And that was something I wanted to capture in the NKS book.</p>\n<p>Typically there were two parts: a personal narrative of how I was led to something—and a historical narrative of what in the past might connect to it. The academic writing style that I’d adopted in the 1980s really didn’t capture either of these. So for the NKS book I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--writing-style/'>needed a new style</a>. And there were again two parts to this. First, I needed to “put myself into the text”, describing in the first person how I’d reached conclusions, and what their importance to me was. And second, I needed to “tell the story” of whatever historical developments were relevant.</p>\n<p>Early on, I made the decision not to mix these kinds of narratives. I would talk about my own relation to the material. And I would talk about other people and their <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--historical-notes/'>historical relation to the material</a>. But I didn’t talk about my interactions with other people. And, yes, there are lots of wonderful stories to tell—which perhaps one day I’ll have a chance to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/historical-perspectives'>systematically write down</a>. But for the NKS book I decided that these stories—while potentially fun to read—just weren’t relevant to the absorption and contextualization of what I had to say. So, with a bit of regret, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--autobiographical-elements/'>I left them out</a>.</p>\n<p>In typical academic papers one references other work by inserting pure, uncommented citations to it. And deep within some well-developed field, this is potentially an adequate thing to do. Because in such a field, the structure is in a sense already laid out, so a pure citation is enough to explain the connection. But for the NKS book it was quite different. Because most of the time the historical antecedents were necessarily done in quite different conceptual frameworks—and typically the only reasonable way to see the connection to them was to tell the story of what was done and why, recontextualized in an “NKS way”.</p>\n<p>And what this meant was that in writing the NKS book, I ended up doing a huge amount of “scholarship”, tracking down history, and trying to piece together the stories of what happened and why. Sometimes I personally knew—or had known—the people involved. Sometimes I was dealing with things that had happened centuries ago. Often there were mysteries involved. How did this person come to be thinking about this? Why didn’t they figure this-or-that out? What really was their conceptual framework?</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a person who tries to “do my homework” in any field I’m studying. I want to know both what’s known, and what’s not known. I want to get a sense of the patterns of thinking in the field, and “value systems” of the field. Many times in working on the NKS book I got the sense that this-or-that field should be relevant. But what was important for the NKS book was often something that was a footnote—or was even implicitly ignored—by the field. And it also didn’t help that the names for things in particular fields were often informed by their specific uses there, and didn’t connect with what was natural for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>I started the NKS book shortly after the web was invented, and well before there was substantial content on it. So at least at first a lot of my research had to be done the same way I’d done it in the 1980s: from printed books and papers, and by using online and printed abstracting systems.

Perhaps it might have been nice when the NKS book was published to be able to say in a kind of traditional academic style “here are the ‘citations’” (and, finally, 20 years later we’re about to be able to actually do that). But at the time it wasn’t the simple citations I wanted, or thought would be useful; it was the narrative I could piece together from them. </p>\n<p>And sometimes the papers weren’t enough, and I had to make requests from document archives, or actually interview people. It was hard work, with a steady stream of surprises. For example, in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/u/?search=Ulam'>Stan Ulam</a>’s archives we found a (somewhat scurrilous) behind-the-scenes interaction about me. And after many hours of discussion <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/con-cp/?search=Conway'>John Conway</a> admitted to me that his usual story about the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--history-of-cellular-automata/'>origin of the Game of Life wasn&#8217;t correct</a>—though I at least found the true story much more interesting (even if some mystery still remains). There were times when the things I wanted to know were still entangled in government or other secrecy. And there were times when people had just outright forgotten, often because the things I now cared about just hadn’t seemed important before—and now could only be recovered by painstakingly “triangulating” from other recollections and documents.</p>\n<p>There were so many corners to the scholarship involved in creating the NKS book. One memorable example was what we called the “People Dates” project. I wanted the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/names/'>index to include</a> not only the name of every person I mentioned in the book, but also their dates, and the primary country or countries in which they worked, as in “Wolfram, Stephen (England/USA, 1959&#8211; ).”</p>\n<p>For some people that information was straightforward enough to find. But for other people there were challenges. There were 484 people altogether in the index, with a roughly exponentially increasing number born after about 1800: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='465' height='237' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section13img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For ones who were alive we just sent them email, usually getting helpful (if sometimes witty) responses. In other cases we had to search government records, ask institutions, or find relatives or other personal contacts. There were lots of weird issues about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--people-in-the-index/'>transliterations, historical country designations, and definitions of &#8220;worked in&#8221;</a>. But in the end we basically got everything (though for example <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/s-sg/?search=Sch%C3%B6nfinkel'>Moses Schönfinkel</a>’s date of death remained a mystery, as it does even now, after all <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/a-little-closer-to-finding-what-became-of-moses-schonfinkel-inventor-of-combinators/'>my recent research</a>). </p>\n<p>Most of the historical research I did for the NKS book wound up in notes at the back of the book. But of all the 1350 notes spread over 348 small-print pages, only <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/'>102 were in the end historical</a>. The other notes covered a remarkable range of subject matter. They provided background information, technical details and additional results. And in many ways the notes represent the highest density of information in the NKS book—and I, for example, constantly find myself referring to them, and to their pithy (and, I think, rather clear) summaries of all sorts of things.</p>\n<p>When I was working on the book there were often things I thought I’d better figure out, just in case they were relevant to the core narrative of the book. Sometimes they’d be difficult things, and they’d take me—and my computers—days or even weeks. But quite often what came out just didn’t fit into the core narrative of the book, or its main text. And so the results were relegated to notes. Maybe there’ll just be one sentence in the notes making some statement. But behind that statement was a lot of work. </p>\n<p>Many times I would have liked to have had “notes to the notes”. But I restrained myself from adding yet more to the project. Even though today I’ve sometimes found myself writing <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/after-100-years-can-we-finally-crack-posts-problem-of-tag-a-story-of-computational-irreducibility-and-more/'>even hundreds of pages</a> to expand on what in the NKS book is just a note, or <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>even a part of a note</a>.</p>\n<p>The 1990s spanned the time from the very beginning of the web to the point where the web had a few million pages of content. And by the later years of the project I was making use of the web whenever I could. But often the background facts I needed for the notes were so obscure that there was nothing coherent about them on the web—and in fact even today it’s common for the notes to the NKS book to be the best summaries to be found anywhere. </p>\n<p>I figured, though, that the existence of the web could at least “get me off the hook” on some work I might otherwise have had to do. For example, I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--citations-and-references/'>didn&#8217;t think there was any point in giving explicit citations to documents</a>. I made sure to include relevant names of people and topics. Then it seemed as if it’d be much better just to search for those on the web, and find all relevant documents, than for me to do all sorts of additional scholarship trying to pick out particular citations that then someone might have to go to a library to look up. </p>\n<h2 id='finishing-the-book'>Finishing the Book</h2>\n<p>I’m not sure when I could say that the finishing of the NKS book finally seemed in sight. We’d been making bound book mockups since early 1994. Looking through them now it’s interesting to see how different parts gradually came together. In July 1995, for example, there was already a section in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics/'>Chapter 9</a> on &ldquo;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-6--the-nature-of-space'>The Nature of Space</a>&rdquo;, but it was followed by a section on the “Nature of Time” that was just a few rough notes. There’s a hiatus in mockups in 1996 (when I was working on Mathematica 3.0) but when the mockups pick up again in January 1997—now bound in three volumes—there’s a section on “The Nature of Time” containing an early (and probably not very good) idea based on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-9--fundamental-physics#sect-9-11--uniqueness-and-branching-in-time'>multiway systems</a> that I’d long since forgotten (later “The Nature of Time” section would be broken into different sections): </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='416' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Already in 1997 there’s a very rough skeleton of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Chapter 12</a>—with a fairly accurate collection of section headings, but just 18 pages of rather rough notes as content. Meanwhile, there’s a post-Chapter-12 “Epilog” that sprouts up, to be dropped only late in the project (see below). Chapter 12 begins to “bulk up” in late 1999, and in 2000 really “takes off”, for example adding the long section on &ldquo;<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-9--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations'>Implications for the Foundations of Mathematics</a>&rdquo;. At that point our rate of making book mockups began to pick up. We’d been indicating different mockups with dates and colored labeling (“the banana version”, etc.) But, finally, dated February 14, 2001, there’s a version labeled (in imitation of software release nomenclature) “Alpha 1”.</p>\n<p>And by then I was starting to make serious use of the machinery for doing large projects that we’d developed for so many years at Wolfram Research. The “NKS Project” started having project managers, build systems and internal websites (yes, with garish web colors of the time):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='574' height='421' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We’d had the source for the book in a source control system for several years, but as far as I was concerned the ultimate source for the book was my filesystem, and a specific set of directories that, yes, are still there in my filesystem all these years later: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='543' height='353' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Everything was laid out by chapter and section. <span class=\"input\">Text</span> contained the FrameMaker files. <span class=\"input\">Notebooks</span> contained the source notebooks for all the diagrams (with long-to-compute results pre-stored in <tt>Results</tt>):</p>\n<p></a></p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='418' height='402' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The workflow was that every diagram was created in Wolfram Language, then saved as an EPS file. (<a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/EPS.html\">EPS or &#8220;Encapsulated PostScript&#8221;</a> was a forerunner of <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/PDF.html\">PDF</a>.) And gradually, over the course of years, more and more EPS files were generated, here reconstructed in the order of their generation, starting around 1994:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-eps-array-@2x.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/3-eps-array-@2x.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='645' height='682' /></a></p>\n<p>In creating all these EPS files, there was lots of detailed tweaking done, for example in the exact (programmatically specified) sizes for the images given in the files.  We&#8217;d built up a whole diagram-generating system, with all sorts of detailed standards for sizings and spacings and so on. And several times—particularly as a result of discovering quirks in the printing process—we decided we had to change the standards we were using. This could have been a project-derailing disaster. But because we had everything programmatically set up in notebooks it was actually quite straightforward to just go through and automatically regenerate the thousand or so images in the book.</p>\n<p>Each EPS file that was generated was put in a <tt>Graphics</tt> directory, then imported (“by reference”) by FrameMaker into the appropriate page of the book. And the result was something that looked almost like the final NKS book. But there were two “little” wrinkles, that ended up leading to quite a bit of technical complexity.</p>\n<p>The first had to with the fragments of Wolfram Language code in the notes. At the time it was typical to show code in a simple monospaced font like Courier. But I thought this looked ugly—and threw away much of the effort I’d put into making the code as elegant and readable as possible. So I decided we needed a different code font, and in particular a proportionally spaced sans serif one. But there was a technical problem with this. Many of the characters we needed for the code were available in any reasonable font. But some characters were special to the Wolfram Language—or at least were characters that for example we’d been responsible for being included in the <a href='https://home.unicode.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Unicode standard</a>, and weren’t yet widely supported in fonts. </p>\n<p>And the result was that in addition to all the other complexities of producing the book we had to design our own font, just for the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='394' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img5_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But that wasn’t all. In Mathematica 3.0 we had invented an elaborate typesetting system which carefully formatted Wolfram Language code, breaking it into multiple lines if necessary. But how were we to weave that nicely formatted code into the layouts of pages in FrameMaker? In the end we <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--book-production-system/'>had to use Wolfram Language to do this</a>. The way this worked is that first we exported the whole book from FrameMaker in “Maker Interchange Format” (MIF). Then we parsed the resulting MIF file in Wolfram Language, in effect turning the whole book into a big symbolic expression. At that point we could use whatever Wolfram Language functionality we wanted, doing various pattern-matching-based transformations and typesetting each of the pieces of code. (We also handled various aspects of the index at this stage.) Then we took the symbolic expression, converted it to MIF, and imported it back into FrameMaker.</p>\n<p>In the end the production of the book was handled by an automated build script—just like the ones we used to build Mathematica (the full build log is 11 pages long):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img6.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='' width='' height='228' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But, OK, so by early 2001 we were well on the way to setting all these technical systems up. But there was more to do in “producing the book”—as indicated for example by the various column headings in the project management internal website. “Graphics regenerated” was about regenerating all the EPS files with the final standards for the book. “Microtweaking” was about making sure the placement of all the graphics was just right. Then there were various kinds of what in our company we call “document quality assurance”, or DQA—checking every detail of the document, from grammar and spelling to overall consistency and formatting. (And, yes, <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--writing-style/'>developing a style guide that worked with my sometimes-nonstandard</a>—but I believe highly sensible!—writing conventions.)</p>\n<p>In addition to checking the form of the book, there was also the question of checking the content. Much of that—including extensive fact checking, etc.—had gone on throughout the development of the book. But near the end one more piece of checking had to do with the code that was included in the book itself. Our company has had a long history of sophisticated software quality assurance (“SQA”), and I applied that to the book—for example having extensive tests written for all the code in the book.</p>\n<p>Much like for software, once we reached the first “Alpha version” of the book we also started sending it out to external “alpha testers”—and got a modest but helpful collection of responses. We had several pages of instructions for our “testers” (that we called “readers” since, after all, this was a book):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='527' height='514' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section14img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After the “Alpha 1” version of the book in February 2001, there followed six more “Alpha” versions. In “Alpha 1” there were still XXXX’s scattered around the text, alignment and other issues in graphics—and some of the more “philosophical” sections in the book were just in note form, crossed out with big X’s in the printout. But in the course of 2001 all these issues got ironed out. And on January 15, 2002, I finished and dated the preface.</p>\n<p>Then on February 4, 2002, we produced the &#8220;Beta 1&#8221; version of the book—and began to make final preparations for its printing and publication.

In these times of ubiquitous full-text search one might think that a book index would just be a quaint relic of the past (and indeed some younger people don’t even seem to know that most books have indices!). But it definitely isn’t with the NKS book. And indeed when I want to find something in the book, the place I always turn first is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/0/'>index (now online)</a>. </p>\n<p>I started creating the index to the NKS book in the spring of 1999, and finished it right before the final version of the book was produced in February 2002. I had already had the experience of creating indices to five editions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>, and had seen the importance of those indices in people’s actual use of Mathematica. I had developed various <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--index/'>theories about how to make a good index</a>—which sometimes differed from conventional wisdom—but seemed to work rather well. </p>\n<p>A good index, I believe, should list whatever terms one might actually think of looking up, regardless of whether it’s those literal terms—or just synonyms for them—that appear in the text. If there’s a phrase (like “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>finite automata</a>”) explicitly list it in all the ways people might think of it (“<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>finite automata</a>”, “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=finite+automata'>automata, finite</a>”), rather than having some “theory” (that the users of the index are very unlikely to know) about how to list the phrase. And perhaps most important, generously include subterms, “subdividing” until each individual entry references at most a few pages. Because when you’re looking for something, you want to be able to zero in on a particular page, not be confronted with lots of “potentially relevant” pages. And well-chosen subterms immediately give a kind of pointillistic map of the coverage of some area.</p>\n<p>I’ve always enjoyed creating indices. For me it’s an interesting exercise in quickly organizing knowledge and identifying what’s important, as well as engaging in rapid “what are different ways to say that?” association. (And, yes, a similar skill is needed in linguistic curation for the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/natural-language-understanding/'>natural language understanding system</a> of <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>.) For the NKS book (and other indices) my basic strategy was to go through the book page by page, adding tags for index entries. But what about consistency? Did I just index “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fig+leaves'>Fig leaves</a>” in one place, and somewhere else index “Leaves, fig” instead? We built Wolfram Language code to identify such issues. But eventually I just generated the alphabetical index, and read through it. And then had Wolfram Language code that could realign tags to correct the source of whatever fixes I made—which most often related to subterms.</p>\n<p>At first I broke the index into an ordinary “Index” and an “Index of Names”. But what counted as a “name”? Only a person’s name? Or also a place name? Or also “rule 30”? Within a couple of months I had combined everything into an “Index of words, names, concepts and systems”—which soon became headed just “Index” (with a pointer to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--index/'>a note about what was in it</a>). </p>\n<p>The final index is remarkably eclectic—reflecting of course the content of the book. After “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Field+theory+(Physics)'>Field theory (physics)</a>” comes “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fields+(agricultural)'>Fields (agricultural)</a>”, followed by “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Fifths+(musical+chords)'>Fifths (musical chords)</a>” and so on: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='555' height='614' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section15img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the end the index—even printed as it was in 4 columns—ran to 80 pages (or more than 6% of the book). It was obviously a very useful index, and it could even be entertaining to read, not only for its eclectic jumps from one term to the next, but also for the unexpected terms that appeared. What’s “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Flash+photography'>Flash photography</a>” or “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/f-fli/?search=Flint+arrowheads'>Flint arrowheads</a>” doing there, or “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/index/flo-fz/?search=Frogs'>Frogs</a>” for that matter? What do these terms have to do with a new kind of science? </p>\n<p>But for all its value, I was a bit concerned that the index might be so long that it finally made the book “too long”. Even without the index the book ran to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1197--historical-perspectives/'>1197 pages</a>. But why tell people, I thought, that the whole book is really 1280 pages, including the index? If the pages of the index were numbered, then one could immediately see the number of that last page. But why number the pages of an index? Nobody needs to refer to those pages by numbers; if anything, just use the alphabetized terms. So I decided just quietly to omit the page numbers of the index, so we could report the length of the book as 1192 pages.</p>\n<h2 id='how-to-publish-a-book'>How to Publish a Book</h2>\n<p>OK, so <em>A New Kind of Science</em> was going to be a book. But how was it going to be published? At the time I started writing <em>A New Kind of Science</em> in 1991 the second edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> had just been released, and its publisher (Addison-Wesley) seemed to be doing a good job with it. So it was natural to start talking about my new book with the same publisher. I was quite aware that Addison-Wesley was primarily a publisher of textbook-like books, and in fact the particular division of Addison-Wesley that had published <em>The Mathematica Book</em> was more oriented towards monographs and special projects. But the success of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> generated what seemed like good corporate interest in trying to publish my new book.</p>\n<p>But how would the details work? There were immediate questions even about printing the book. I knew the book would rely heavily on graphics which would need to be printed well. But to print them how they needed to be printed was expensive. So how would that work financially? (And at that point I didn’t yet even know that the book would also be more than a thousand pages long.) </p>\n<p>The basic business model of publishing tends to be: invest up front in making a book, then (hopefully) make money by selling the book. And for most authors, the book can’t happen without that up-front investment. But that wasn’t my situation. I didn’t need an advance to support myself while writing the book. I didn’t need someone to pay for the production of the book. And if necessary I could even make the investment myself to print the books. But what I thought I needed from a publisher was access to distribution channels. I needed someone to actually sell books to bookstores. I needed there to be a sales team that had relationships with bookstore chains, and that would do things like actually visit bookstores and get books into them.</p>\n<p>And in fact quite a lot of the early discussion about the publishing of the book centered around how salespeople would present it. How would the book be positioned relative to the well-known “popular science” books of the time? (That positioning would be key to the size of initial purchases bookstores might make.) What special ways might the salespeople make the book memorable? Could we get enough textile cone shells that the salespeople could drop one off at every bookstore they visited? (The answer, it was determined, was yes: in the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-7--collecting-shells/'>Philippines such shells were quite plentiful</a>.)</p>\n<p>But how exactly would the numbers work? Bookstores took a huge cut (often above 50%). And if the book was expensive to print, that didn’t leave much of a margin. At least at the time, the publishing industry was very much based on formulas. If you spend $x to print a book, you need to spend $y on marketing, and you pay the author $y (yes, same y) as an advance on royalties. For the author, the advance serves as a kind of guarantee of the publisher’s effort—since unless the book sells, the publisher just loses that money.</p>\n<p>Well, I most definitely wanted a guarantee that the publisher would put effort in. But I didn’t need or want an advance; I just wanted the publisher to put as much as possible into distribution. Around and around it went, trying to see how that might work. Exasperated, I found an expert on book deals. They didn’t seem to be able to figure it out either. And I began to think: perhaps I should go to a different publisher, maybe one more familiar with widely distributed books.</p>\n<p>It’s typical for authors not to interact directly with such publishers, but instead to go through an agent. In principle that allows authors not to have to exercise business savvy, and publishers not to be exposed to the foibles of authors. But I just wanted to make what—at least by tech industry standards—was a very simple deal. One agent I’d known for a while insisted that the key was to maximize the advance: “If the book earns out its advance [i.e. brings in more royalties from actual sales than were paid out up front], I haven’t done my job.” But that wasn’t my way of doing business. I wanted both sides in any deal to do well. </p>\n<p>Then there was the question of which publisher would be the right one. “Sell to the highest bidder”, was the typical advice. But what I cared about was successful book distribution, not how much a publisher might (perhaps foolishly) spend to get the book. Particularly at the time, it was a very clubby but strangely dysfunctional industry, full of belief in a kind of magic touch, but also full of stories of confusion and failure. Still, I thought that access to distribution channels was important enough to be worth navigating this.</p>\n<p>And by 1993 quite a bit of time had been spent on discussions about publishing the book. A particular, prominent New York publisher had been identified, and the process of negotiating a contract with them was underway. From a tech industry point of view it all seemed quite Victorian. It started from a printed (as in, on a printing press) 70-page contract that seemed to date from 20 years earlier. Though after not very long, essentially every single clause had been crossed out, and replaced by something different. </p>\n<p>An effort to “show what value they could bring” led to the incident about cover designs mentioned above. And then there was the story about printing, and printing costs. The terms of our potential deal made it quite important to know just how much it would cost to print the book. So to get a sense of that we got quotes from some of our usual printing vendors (and, yes, in those days before the web, a software company like ours did lots of printing). The publisher insisted that our quotes were too high—and that they could print the book much more cheaply. My team was skeptical. But at the center of this discussion was an important technical issue about how the book would actually be printed.</p>\n<p>Most widely distributed (&#8220;trade&#8221;) books are printed on so-called web presses—which are giant industrial machines that take paper from a roll and move it through at perhaps 30 mph. (The term “web” here refers to the “web of paper” on its path through the machine, not the subsequently invented World Wide Web.) A web press is a good way to print a just-read-the-words kind of book. But it doesn’t give one much control for pictures; if everything’s running through at high speed one can’t, for example, carefully inject more ink to deal with a big area of black on a specific page.</p>\n<p>And so if one wanted to print a more “art-quality” book one had to use a different approach: a sheet-fed press in which each collection of pages is “manually” set up to be printed separately on a large sheet of paper. Sheet-fed presses give one much more control—but they’re more expensive to operate. The printing quotes we’d got were for sheet-fed presses, because that was the only way we could see printing the book at the quality level we wanted. (I was sufficiently curious about the whole process that I went to watch a print run for something we were printing. In interacting with our potential publisher, I was rather disappointed to discover that none of the editorial team appeared to have ever actually seen anything being printed.)</p>\n<p>But in any case the publisher was claiming that they knew better than us, and that they could get the quality we needed on a web press, at a much lower price. They offered to run a test to prove it. We were again skeptical: to do the setup for a web press is an expensive process, and it makes no sense to do it for anything other than a real print run of thousands of books. But the publisher insisted they could do it. And our only admonition was “Don’t show us a result claiming it was made on a web press when it wasn’t!”. </p>\n<p>A few weeks went by. Back came the test. “You can’t be serious”, we said. “That’s a sheet from a sheet-fed press; we can see the characteristic registration marks!” I never quite figured out if they thought they could pull the wool over our eyes, or if this was just pure cluelessness. But for me it was basically the last straw. They came back and said “Why don’t we just refactor the contract and give you a really big advance?” “Nope”, I said “you’re profoundly missing the point! We’re done.” And that’s how—in 1995—we came to make the decision to publish <em>A New Kind of Science</em> “ourselves”.</p>\n<p>But when I say “ourselves” there was quite a bit more to that story. Back at the beginning of 1995 we were thinking about the upcoming third edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>, and realizing that we needed to re-jigger its publishing arrangements. And while the machinations with publishers about the NKS book had been a huge waste of time, they had helped me understand more about the publishing industry—and made me decide it was time for us to create our own publishing “imprint”, <a href='https://www.wolfram-media.com/'>Wolfram Media</a>.</p>\n<p><a href='https://web.archive.org/web/19961222151452/https://wolfram-media.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>Its website from 1996</a> (I never liked that logo!) highlights our first title—the co-published third edition of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='484' height='588' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This was soon joined by other titles, like our <a href='https://www.wolfram-media.com/products/graphica1.html'>heavily illustrated<em> Graphica </em>books</a>. But it wasn’t until 1999 that I began to think more seriously about the final publishing of the NKS book. In the fall of 1999 we duly listed the book with the large bookstore chains and book distributors, as well as with the already-very-successful Amazon. And in late 2000 we started touting the book on our <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20001018202031/https://www.wolfram-media.com' target=_blank rel=noopener>now-more-attractive website</a> as “A major release coming soon&#8230;”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='564' height='456' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Particularly in those days, the typical view was that most of the sales of a book would happen in the first few weeks after it was published. But—as we’ll discuss later—printing a book (and especially one like the NKS book) takes many weeks. So that creates a tricky situation, in which a publisher has to make a high-stakes decision about how many books to print at the beginning. Print too few books and at least for a time, you won’t be able to fill orders, and you’ll lose out on the initial sales peak. Print too many books and you’ll be left with an inventory of unsold books—though the more books you print in a single print run, the more you’ll spread the initial setup cost over more books, and the lower the cost of each individual book will be.</p>\n<p>Bookstores were also an important part of the picture. Books were at the time still predominantly bought through people physically browsing at bookstores. So the more copies of a book a bookstore had, the more likely it was that someone would see it there, and buy it. And all this added up to a big focus of publishing being on the size of the initial orders that bookstores made.</p>\n<p>How was that determined? Mostly it was up to the buyers at bookstores and bookstore chains: they had to understand enough about a book to make an accurate prediction of how many they’d be able to sell. There was a complicated dance through which publishers signaled their expectations, saying for example “X copy initial print run”, “X-city promotional tour”, “$X promotional budget”. But in the end it was a very person-to-person sales process, often done by traveling-around-the-country salespeople who’d developed relationships with book buyers over the course of many years.</p>\n<p>How were we going to handle this? It certainly helped that by late 2000 there were starting to be <a href='https://www.forbes.com/asap/2000/1127/162.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>lengthy news articles</a> anticipating the book. And it also helped that one could see that the book was gaining momentum on Amazon. But would a sales manager we had who was used to selling software be able to sell books? At least in this case the answer was yes, and by the end of 2001 there were starting to be substantial orders from bookstores.</p>\n<p>By the time I finished writing the book at the beginning of 2002 we were in full “book-publishing” mode. There were still lots of issues to resolve. How would we handle distribution outside the US? (We’d actually had a UK co-publisher lined up but we eventually gave up on them.) How would we reach the full range of independent bookstores? And so on. Looking at my archives I find mail from April 2002 in which I was contacting Jeff Bezos about a practical issue with Amazon; Jeff responded that he “couldn’t wait to read [the book]”, noting that “For a serious book like yours, we often account for a substantial fraction of sales.” He was right—and in fact the NKS book would reach the #1 bestseller slot on Amazon.</p>\n<p>By the beginning of 2002 we’d had a design for the front cover of the NKS book for six years. But what about the back cover? It’s traditional to put quotes (“blurbs”) on the backs of books that people will browse in bookstores. So, in February 2002 we sent a few draft copies of the book to people we thought might give us interesting quotes. Probably the most charming response was Arthur C. Clarke’s report of the delivery of the book to his house in Sri Lanka:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='444' height='191' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A few days later, he emailed again “Well, I have &lt;looked&gt; at (almost) every page and am still in a state of shock.

He responded that he thought I really shouldn’t have quotes on the back of the book. “Isaac Newton didn’t have quotes; nor should you.” And, yes, Steve had a point. I was trying to write a book that would have long-term value; it didn’t really make sense to have moment-of-publication quotes printed on it.</p>\n<p>So—feeling bad for having solicited quotes in the first place—we dropped them from the back cover, instead just putting <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/backcoverimages/'>images from the book that we thought would intrigue people</a>:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img5.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img4.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='325' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section16img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Still, my team did use Arthur C.

But there’s a standard method for achieving the appearance of gray, which is to use halftoning, based essentially on an array of dots of different sizes.

That was a difficult question, and was only answered by lots of print testing. One of the main points was: even if you effectively specify dots of a certain size, what will be the actual sizes of dots formed when the ink is absorbed into the paper? And similarly: will the ink from black cells spread into the area of the gray line you’re trying to print between them? In printing it’s typical to talk about “dot gain”. If you think you’re setting up dots to give a certain gray level, what will be the actual gray level you’ll get when those dots are made of ink on paper?</p>\n<p>We were constantly testing things like this, with different printing technology, different paper and so on:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='538' height='389' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img14_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='14_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='14_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We used a “densitometer” (yes, this was before modern digital cameras) to measure the actual gray level, and deduce the dot gain function. And we tested things like how thin lines could be before they wouldn’t print.</p>\n<p>In halftoning, one effectively applies a global “screen” (as in, something with an array of holes in it, just like in pre-digital printing) to determine the positions of dots. We considered effectively setting up our own <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-10-7--halftoning/'>dot placement algorithm</a>, that would for example better align with cells in something like a cellular automaton. But tests didn’t show particularly good behavior, and we soon reverted to considering the “traditional approach”, though with various kinds of tweaking. </p>\n<p>Should the halftone dots be round, or elliptical? What should the angle of the array of dots be (it definitely needed to avoid horizontal and vertical directions)?

Given that one already has film, one can make the plate essentially photographically—more or less the same way microprocessor layouts and many other things are made. But by the beginning of the 2000s, there was a new technology: direct-to-plate printing, in which an (ultraviolet) laser directly etches the plate (a kind of much-higher-resolution “plate analog” of what a laser printer does). And in order to get the very crispest results, direct-to-plate printing was what we used for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>What’s the actual setup for printing? In the sheet-fed approach that we were using, one combines multiple pages (in our case 8) as a “signature” to be printed from a single plate onto a single piece of paper. Here’s a (yes, rather-unremarkable-looking) actual plate that was used for the first printing of the NKS book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img19.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='573' height='425' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And here’s an example of a signature printed from it, with pages that will subsequently be cut and folded:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img20.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img20.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='573' height='368' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img20_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='20_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='20_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Under a microscope, the plate looks pretty much like what will finally be printed onto the paper:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img21.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img21.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='475' height='256' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But now the next big issue is: what kind of paper should one use? If the paper is glossy, ink won’t spread on it, and it’s easier to get things crisp. But adding a glossy coating to paper makes the paper heavier and thicker, and we quickly determined that it wasn’t going to be practical to print the NKS book on glossy paper. Back in the 1980s it had become quite popular to print books on paper that looked good at first, but after a few years would turn yellow and disintegrate. And to avoid that, we knew we needed acid-free paper.</p>\n<p>Any particular kind of paper will come in different “weights”, or thicknesses. And the thicker the paper is, the more opaque it will be, and the less see-through the pages of the book will be—but also the thicker the book will be with a given number of pages. At the beginning we didn’t know how long the NKS book would be, and we were looking at comparatively thick papers; by the end we were trying to use paper that was as thin as possible.</p>\n<p>Back in 1993 we&#8217;d identified Finch Opaque as a possible type of paper. In 1995 our paper rep suggested as an alternative Finch VHF (“Very High Finish”)—which was very smooth, and was quite bright white. But normally this paper was used in very thick pages. Still, it was possible for the paper mill to produce thinner versions as well. We studied the possibilities, and eventually decided that a 50-lb version (i.e. with the paper weighing 50 lbs per 500 uncut sheets) would be the best compromise between bulk and opacity. So 50-lb Finch VHF paper is what the NKS book is printed on.</p>\n<p>Paper, of course, is made from trees. And as I’ll explain below, during the publishing of the NKS book, I became quite aware of the physical location of the trees from which the paper for the NKS book was made: they were in upstate New York (in the Adirondacks). At the time, though, I didn’t know more details about the trees. But a few years ago I learned that they were <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=eastern+hemlock'>eastern hemlock trees</a>. And it turns out that these coniferous trees are unusual in having long fibers—which is what allows the paper to be as smooth as it is. Talking about hemlock makes one think of Socrates. But no, hemlock the poison comes from the <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=poison+hemlock'>&#8220;poison hemlock&#8221; plant</a> (<em><a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Conium+maculatum'>Conium maculatum</a></em>), which is unrelated to <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=tsuga'>hemlock trees</a> (which didn’t grow in Europe and seem to have gotten their hemlock name only fairly recently, and for rather tenuous reasons). So, no, the NKS book is not poisonous!</p>\n<p>Once signatures are printed, the next thing is that the signatures have to be folded and cut—in the end forming little booklet-like objects. And then comes the final step: binding these pieces together into the finished book. By the mid-1990s <em>The Mathematica Book</em> had given us quite a bit of experience with the binding of “big books”—and it wasn’t good. Many copies of multiple versions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em> (yes, not printed by us) had basically self-destructed in the hands of customers. </p>\n<p>How were we going to be sure this wouldn’t happen for the NKS book? First, many books—including some versions of <em>The Mathematica Book</em>—were basically “bound” by just gluing the signatures into the “case” of the book (with little fake threads added at the ends, for effect). But to robustly bind a big book one really has to actually sew the signatures to the case, and a standard way to do this is what’s called Smythe sewing. And that’s what we determined to use for the NKS book.</p>\n<p>Still, we wanted to test things. So we sent books to a book-testing lab, where the books were “tumbled” inside a steel container, 1200 times per hour, “impacting the tail, binding edge, head and face” of each book 4800 times per hour. After 1 hour, the lab reported “spine tight and intact”. After 2 hours “text block detached from cover”. But that’s basically only after doing the equivalent of dropping the book thousands of times!</p>\n<p>As we approached the final printing of the NKS book, there were other decisions to be made. The <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-0-1--endpapers/'>endpapers</a> were going to have a rule 30 pattern printed on them. But what color should they be? We considered several, picking the goldenrod in the end (and somehow that color now seems to have become the standard for the endpapers of all books I write):</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='283' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section17img22_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='22_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the late stages of writing the NKS book one of the big concerns was just how long the book would eventually be. We’d figured out the paper, the binding, and so on. And there was one hard constraint: the binding machines that we were going to use could only bind a book up to a certain thickness. With our specs the limit was 80 signatures—or 1280 pages. The main text clocked in at 1197 pages; with front matter, etc. that was 1213 pages. But then there was the index. And I was writing a very extensive index, that threatened to overrun our absolute maximum page count. We formatted the index in 4 columns as small and tight as we thought we could. And in the end it came in just under the wire: the book was 1280 pages, with not a single page to spare. (Somewhat simplifying the story, I’ve sometimes said that after a decade of work on the NKS book, I had to stop because otherwise I was going to have a book that was too long to bind!) </p>\n<h2 id='the-great-printing-adventure'>The Great Printing Adventure</h2>\n<p>High-quality printing of the kind needed for the NKS book was then—and is now—often done in the Far East. But anticipating that we might need to reprint the book fairly quickly we didn’t consider that an option; it would just take too long to transport books by boat across the Pacific. And conveniently enough, we determined that there was a cost-effective North American alternative: print the book in Canada. And so it was that we chose a printer in Winnipeg, Canada, to print the NKS book.</p>\n<p>On February 7, 2002, the files for the book (which were now PDF, not pure PostScript) were transferred (via FTP) to the printer’s computers—a process which took a mere 90 minutes. (Well, it had to be done twice, because of an initial glitch.) But then the next step was to produce “proofs” for the book. In traditional printing, where printing plates were made from film, one could produce the film first, then make a photographic print of this, check it, and only then make the plates. But we were going to be making plates directly. So for us, “proofing” was a more digital process, that involved using a separate device from the one that would actually make the plates. Supposedly, though, “the bits were the bits”, and the results would be the same.</p>\n<p>Within a couple of days, the printer had the first proofs made, and a few issues were seen—such as white labels inside black cells simply disappearing. The cause was subtle, though didn’t take a long time to find. Some 3D graphics in the book had generated color PostScript—and in all our tests so far these had just automatically been converted to grayscale. But now the presence of color primitives had made the RIP that was converting from PostScript change its settings—and cause other problems. But soon that was worked around, and generating proofs continued. </p>\n<p>By February 14 we had the first batch of proofs in our hands, and my team and I went to work going through them.

But this problem at least we could understand—and it was our fault. Instead of setting the thickness of the arrow in some absolute way, we’d just set it to be “1 pixel”—which in the final printing was too thin to see.</p>\n<p>But what about the other glitches? What were they? And might there be more of them?</p>\n<p>The signatures from the book were ready to start being bound. Should we hold off and reprint the signatures where we’d found glitches? Could we do this without blowing our (already very tight) schedule? Could we even get enough extra paper in time? My team was adamant that we should try to fix the glitches, saying that otherwise they would “nag at us forever”. But I wanted first to see if we could characterize the bug better.</p>\n<p>We knew it was associated with the rendering of the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/PostScript-Language-Reference-Manual-ADOBE/dp/0201101742' target=_blank rel=noopener>PostScript</a> <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator. Even though PostScript is basically a vector graphics description language, the <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator allows one to include bitmaps. Normally these bitmaps are used to represent things like photographs, and have tiny (“few-pixel”) cells. But in the cellular-automaton-like images we were having trouble with, the cells were much larger; in the case of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p157--continuous-cellular-automata/'>page 157</a>, for example, each one was roughly 75 of the final 2400-dpi pixels across. This was absolutely something the <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator was set up to handle. But somehow something was going wrong.</p>\n<p>And what was particularly surprising is that it seemed as if the problem was happening after the PostScript was converted to a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/TIFF.html'>TIFF</a>. Could it perhaps be in the driver for both the proofing and the final plate production system? Time was short, and we needed to make a decision about what to do.</p>\n<p>I fired off an email to the CEO of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creo_(company)' target=_blank rel=noopener>company that made the direct-to-plate system</a>, saying: &#8220;We of course do not know the details of your software and hardware systems. However, we have done a little investigation. It appears that the data &#8230; in the case of this image is a bilevel TIFF with <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p565/'>LZW compression</a>. We speculate that the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1072a/'>LZW dictionary</a> contains something close to the actual squares seen in the image, and that somehow pointers to dictionary entries are being corrupted or are not being used correctly in the decompression of the TIFF. The TIFF experts at my company say they have never seen anything like this in developing software based on standard imaging libraries, making us suspect that it may be some kind of buffering or motion optimization bug associated with your actual hardware driver.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The CEO of what was by then quite a large company had personally designed the original hardware, and when we talked by phone he speculated that what we were seeing might be some kind of obscure mechanical issue with the hardware. But his chief of software soon sent mail explaining that “of the several hundred thousand books that go through [their system] each year, there are a couple that have imaging problems like this.” But, he added, “Usually they are books about halftone screening algorithms, which cause an almost-recursive problem&#8230;”. He said the specific issue we were having looked like a “difficult to reproduce problem we have known about for some time but is transient enough that re-imaging the same file can ‘correct’ the problem.” He added that: “Our hypothesis is that it is related to a memory access error in the RIP that manifests only at low-memory conditions, or after many allocation/deallocation cycles of RAM blocks. The particular code path is not one we have source-code access to, and is rumored to be many years old, so not many people on earth are prepared to make substantive changes to it.”</p>\n<p>OK, so what next? The RIP had been developed by Adobe, creators of PostScript. So I emailed <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=john+warnock'>John Warnock</a>, co-founder of Adobe, who I’d met at quite a few software-industry get-togethers before my NKS-book “hermit period”. I commented that “One thing that’s peculiar (at least without knowing how the RIP works) is that the glitch involves overwriting of a column &#8230; even though scanning the underlying PostScript would involve going from one row to the next.” Warnock responded helpfully, copying his team, though saying (in an echo of what we’d already heard) “I don’t know who does PostScript stuff anymore”. </p>\n<p>Well, that seemed like pretty much the end of the road. So we decided to assume that the glitches we’d found were the only ones, and—for perfection’s sake—we’d reprint those signatures, which by that point the printer had helpfully said they could do without blowing the schedule.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Adobe delivered a new version of the RIP, in which they believed the bug had been fixed, noting that there had been significant code cleanup, and they were now using a newer version of the C++ compiler. Meanwhile, I’d realized another issue: a variety of magazines had requested files from us to be able to print high-resolution images from the book. Would they end up using the same software pipeline, and potentially have the same problem? A general release of any fix was still quite far away. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, with the two “glitch” signatures reprinted, the book was off to be bound. The cover had also been printed, now making use of all four stations of the presses. Under a microscope the characteristic <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1078b/'>&#8220;rosettes&#8221; of 4-color printing</a> are visible:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='366' height='291' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img17_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Actually, the book in a sense has two covers: a detachable dust jacket (including a dated picture of me!) and a “permanent” hard cover—which I think looks very nice:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/709577304?h=1fb80366b2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>But as I was just now looking back through my archives I found an email from February 2002, expressing concerns about the fading of ink on the cover. The printer assured us that we had “nothing to worry about unless the books were exposed to direct sunlight for an extended amount of time.” But then they added “The reds and yellows will fade faster that the other pigments, but this is not something that would be noticeable in the first 20–40 years.” Well, it’s now been 20 years, and it so happens that I have a copy of the NKS book that’s been exposed to sunlight for much of that time—and look what’s happened to its spine, right on cue:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='319' height='165' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section18img19_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='19_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='19_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I received a first, hand-bound, finished NKS book on April 22. And very soon books were on their way to bookstores and distribution centers. And people were ordering the book—in large numbers. And that meant that the books we’d printed so far weren’t going to be enough. And on May 12—two days before the May 14 official publication date of the book—another print run was started. </p>\n<p>Fortunately it was possible to reuse the plates from the first print run (well, apart from the one which said “First printing”), so we didn’t have to worry about new glitches showing up. </p>\n<p>But once the book was published, demand continued to be strong, and on June 4 we needed to do another print run. And this time new plates had to be made. Were there going to be new glitches? We decided we should check the plates before we started printing—so we sent the person who’d caught the glitches before on a trip to Canada. Turns out the bug hadn’t yet been fixed, and there it was again on pages <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p583--visual-perception/'>583</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p979--the-phenomenon-of-continuity/'>979</a>. </p>\n<p>Some time later I heard that the bug was finally found and fixed, and had been lurking in the implementation of the PostScript <span class=\"input\">image</span> operator for well over a decade. Yes, software is hard. And computational irreducibility is rampant. But in the years since the NKS book was published, no other weird glitches like this have ever shown up. Or at least nobody has ever told us about any.</p>\n<p>But as I was writing this, I wondered: what became of that other glitch that was in the first printing—the one with the thin arrows that was our fault? I opened an NKS book from my desk. No problem.

We’d just initiated a second printing, which would be finished in a few weeks. But based on apparent demand that printing wasn’t going to be sufficient. And in fact a single bookstore chain had just offered to buy the whole second printing. We initiated a third printing on June 4, and then a fourth on June 18. But if we were going to keep the momentum of sales, we knew we had to keep feeding books into the channel.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s where things got difficult again. It just didn&#8217;t seem possible to get enough books, quickly enough. But after everything we’d done to this point, I wasn’t going to be stopped here. And I went into full “hands-on CEO” mode, trying to see how to juggle logistics to make things work. </p>\n<p>The paper mill was in Glens Falls, NY. Once the paper had been made, it had to be trucked 2752 km to the printer in Winnipeg, Canada. Then the finished “book blocks” had to go 2225 km to the bindery in Toronto (or maybe there was an alternative bindery in Portland, OR, 2400 km away). And finally the bound books had to come to our warehouse in Illinois, or go directly to book distribution centers. </p>\n<p>My archives contain a diagram I made trying to see how to connect these things together, particularly in view of the impending Canada Day holiday on July 1:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='566' height='524' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section19img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I have pages and pages of notes, with details of ink drying times (1 day), sheets of paper per skid (20,000), people needed per shift, and so on.

At last it was figured out: multiple truckloads of books had somehow been misplaced at the distribution center. (How do you lose something that big?) And, yes, some sales momentum was lost.

Particularly from the early years of the project, there are endless photographs—and investigations—of examples of complexity in nature, which never made it into <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-8--implications-for-everyday-systems/'>Chapter 8</a>. There are also lots of additional results about specific systems from the computational universe—as well as lots of details about history—that could have been notes to the notes, except I didn’t have those.</p>\n<p>Something I didn’t remember is that in 1999—as the book was nearing completion—I considered adding a pictorial “Quick Summary” at the front of the book, here in draft form:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/20.01.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='584' height='680' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I’m not sure if this would have been a good idea, but in the end it effectively got replaced by the textual “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-1--the-foundations-for-a-new-kind-of-science#sect-1-1--an-outline-of-basic-ideas'>An Outline of Basic Ideas</a>” that appears at the very beginning of the book. Still, right when the book was being published, I did produce an “outside the book” <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/reference/CAandNature.pdf'>pictorial 1-pager</a> about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>Chapter 2</a> that saw quite a bit of use, especially for media briefings:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img2.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='398' height='553' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>But as I was looking through my archives, my biggest “rediscovery” is the “Epilog” to the book. There are versions of it from quite early in the development of the book, but the last time it appears is in the December 15, 2000, draft—right before “Alpha 1”. Then it’s gone. Well, that is, until I just found it again:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img3.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img3.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='339' height='435' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So what’s in this “lost epilog”, with its intriguing title “The Future of the Science in This Book”?

But it’s interesting to see how what I jotted down more than 20 years ago has actually panned out. And in fact I think much of it is surprisingly close to the mark. Plenty of small extensions did indeed get made in the first few years, with larger ones—both in studying abstract systems and in building practical models—coming later. (One notable extension was the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/10/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/'>2,3 Turing machine universality proof</a> at year 5, stimulated by our <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/'>2,3 Turing Machine Prize</a>.) </p>\n<p>How about “major new directions”? We’re remarkably “on cue” there. At year 18 was our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>Physics Project</a>, and from that has emerged the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>, which I consider to be the next major direction building on the ideas of the NKS book. I have to say that when I wrote down these expectations 20+ years ago, I didn’t imagine that I would personally be involved in the “major new direction” I mentioned—but, unexpected as it has been, I feel very fortunate that that’s the way it’s worked out. </p>\n<p>What about technology? Already at year 7 <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> was in many ways a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2009/05/7-years-of-nks-and-its-first-killer-app/'>major &#8220;philosophical spinoff&#8221;</a> of the NKS book. And although one doesn’t know its detailed origins, the proof-of-work concept of bitcoin (which also first appeared at year 7) has fundamental connections to the idea of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility'>computational irreducibility</a>. Meanwhile, the general methodology of searching the computational universe for useful programs is something that has continued to grow. And although the details are more complicated, the whole notion of deep learning in neural nets <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/#machine-learning-and-the-neural-net-renaissance'>can also be thought of as related</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s very hard to assess just what’s happened in “becoming a part of everyday thought”—though it’s been wonderful over the years to run into so many people who’ve told me how much the NKS book affected their way of thinking about things. But my impression is that—despite quite a few specific applications—the truly widespread absorption of ideas like computational irreducibility and their implications is a bit “behind schedule”, though definitely now building well. (One piece of absorption that did happen in the 4–10 year window was into areas like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/06/oh-my-gosh-its-covered-in-rule-30s/'>art and architecture</a>.)</p>\n<p>What about education? 1D cellular automata have certainly become widely used as “do-a-little-extra” examples for both programming and math. But more serious integration of ideas from the NKS book as foundational elements of computational thinking—or as a kind of “pre-computer science”—is basically still a “work in progress”.</p>\n<p>Beyond the main text of the “lost epilog”, I found something else: “Notes for the Epilog”:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img9.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img9.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='574' height='275' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And after short (and unfinished) notes on “The sociology of the new science” and “The role of amateurs”, there’s the most significant “find”: a list of altogether 283 “Open questions” for each of the chapters of the book, most still unanswered. </p>\n<p>In preparation for our first <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Wolfram Summer School</a> (then called the NKS Summer School) in June 2003, I worked on a more detailed version of something similar—but left it incomplete after getting up to the middle of Chapter 4, and didn’t include much if anything from the “Notes to the Epilog” even though I’d been accumulating those for much of the time I worked on the book:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img10.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img10.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='221' height='283' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img10_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='10_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='10_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>During the decade I worked on the NKS book I generated a vast amount of material. Most of it I kept in my still-very-much-extant computer filesystem, and while I can’t say that I’ve reexamined everything there, my impression is that—perhaps apart from some “notes to the notes” material—a large fraction of what should have made it into the NKS book did. But in the course of working on the book there was definitely quite a bit of more ephemeral material. Some was preserved in my computer filesystem. But some was printed out and discarded, and some was simply handwritten. But all these years I’ve kept archive boxes of that material.</p>\n<p>Some of those boxes have now been sealed for nearly 30 years. But I thought it’d be interesting to see what they contain. So I pulled out a box labeled 6/93–10/93. It’s slightly the worse for wear after all these years, but what’s inside is well preserved. I turn over a few pages of notes, printouts and ancient company memos (some sent as faxes). And then: what’s this? </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img11.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img11.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='578' height='364' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw0513section20img11_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='11_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='11_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It’s a note about multiway systems: things that are now central to the multicomputational paradigm I’ve just been pursuing.

But back then there’d been a big rush to get books to bookstores, but on the actual “day of publication” there wasn’t much for me to do.</p>\n<p>It had been a long journey getting to this point, though, and for example the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/pxii--preface/'>acknowledgements at the front of the book</a> listed 376 people who’d helped in one way or another over the decade devoted to writing the book, or in the years beforehand. But in terms of the physical production of the book one clue about what had been involved could be found on the very last page—<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/colophon/'>its “Colophon</a>&rdquo;:</p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='397' height='527' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And, yes, as I’ve explained here, there was quite a story behind the simple paragraph: “The book was printed on 50-pound Finch VHF paper on a sheet-fed press. It was imaged directly to plates at 2400 dpi, with halftones rendered using a 175-line screen with round dots angled at 45°. The binding was Smythe sewn.” And whatever other awards the book would win, it was rather lovely to win one for its creative use of paper: </p>\n<table >\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img2.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img2.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='225' height='269' /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So much about the NKS book was unusual. It was a book about new discoveries on the frontiers of science written for anyone to read. It was a book full of algorithmic pictures like none seen before.

For 20 years we’ve meticulously tracked them. And I think it’s fair to say that all the careful checking we did originally really paid off, because in all the text and pictures in the book remarkably few errors have been found. For example, here’s the list of everything in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-4--systems-based-on-numbers/'>Chapter 4</a>, indicating a few errors that were fixed in early printings—and a couple that remain, and that we are now fixing online:</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img15.png\"><img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img15.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='575' height='210' /></a></p>\n<p>People ask me if there’ll be a second edition of the NKS book. I say no. Yes, there are gradually starting to be more things one can say—and in the past couple of years the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a> and the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> has added significantly more. But there’s nothing wrong with what’s in the NKS book. It remains as valid and coherent as it was 20 years ago. And any “second-edition surgery” would run the risk of degrading its crispness and integrity—and detract from its unique perspective of presenting science at the time of its discovery. </p>\n<p>But, OK, so all those NKS books that were printed on all those tons of paper from hemlock trees 20 years ago: what happened to them? Looking on the web today, one can find a few out there in the wild, sitting on bookshelves alongside a remarkable variety of other books:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnific image\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" href=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img16.png\"><img loading='lazy' class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw051322section21img16.png\" alt='Click to enlarge' title='Click to enlarge' width='567' height='466' /></a></p>\n<p>I myself have many NKS books on my shelves (though admittedly a few more as convenient 2.5-inch “filler bookends”). And—at least when I’m in a “science phase”—I find myself using the online NKS book (if not a physical book) all the time, to see an example of some remarkable phenomenon in the computational universe, or to remind myself of some elaborate explanation or result that I put so much effort into finding all those years ago.</p>\n<p>I consider the NKS book one the great achievements of my life—as well as one of the great “stepping-stone” points in my life, that was made possible by what I’d done before, and that in turn has made possible what I’ve done since. Twenty years later it’s interesting to think back—as I’ve done here—on just what it took to produce the NKS book, and how all those individual steps that I worked so hard on for a decade came together to make the whole that is the NKS book. </p>\n<p>To me it’s a satisfying and inspiring story of what can be achieved with clear vision, sustained effort and a willingness to go where discoveries lead. And as I reflect on achievements of the past it makes me all the more enthusiastic about what’s now possible—and why it’s worth putting great effort today into what we can now build for the future. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kind-Science-Twentieth-Anniversary-Collection/dp/1579550568/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GL9BLLSBPEAF&#038;keywords=new+kind+of+science+20th&#038;qid=1652459905&#038;s=books&#038;sprefix=new+kind+of+science+20th%2Cstripbooks%2C80&#038;sr=1-1\" target='blank'><img class=\"\" title=\"A New Kind of Science Twentieth Anniversary Collection\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/05/sw-writing-banner-ad.png\" alt=\"A New Kind of Science Twentieth Anniversary Collection\" width=\"620\" height=\"185\" /></a></p>\n",

But the amazing (and to me very unexpected) thing is that we can take our new paradigm and also apply it to a huge range of other areas. Just a couple of weeks ago I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>published a 250-page treatise</a> about its application to the “physicalization of metamathematics”—and to providing a very new view of the foundations of mathematics (with implications both for the question of what mathematics really is, and for the practical long-term future of mathematics).<span id=\"more-36394\"></span></p>\n<p>In a sense, everything we’re doing ultimately builds on the great intellectual tide of the past century: the rise of the concept of computation. (And, yes, that’s something in which I’ve been deeply involved both scientifically and technologically throughout my career.) But what’s happening now is something else—that one can see as the birth of what I call the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>. It’s all about doing what our Physics Project has suggested, and going beyond working with specific computations—to look at the systemic behavior of whole interacting collections of computations. In the whole multi-millennium history of science, there’ve only been a very few fundamentally different paradigms for making models of things—and I think multicomputation is basically the fourth one ever. </p>\n<p>And what makes its arrival particularly dramatic is that it comes already supercharged by its deep relation to physics, and by its ability to spread the successes of physics to other areas of science, and beyond. When I started investigating the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> in the 1980s it became clear that there are fundamental barriers to many kinds of scientific progress. But what I didn’t see coming is there would be a new path opened up by a new paradigm: the paradigm of multicomputation. And suddenly there are now all sorts of fundamental questions that are no longer blocked—and instead are ripe for rapid progress.</p>\n<p>Over the past year we’ve started exploring a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#potential-application-areas'>host of potential application areas</a>. We’ve got a concept of “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>formalized subchemistry</a>” with applications to a new way of thinking about molecular computing, and with potentially dramatic implications for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#chemistry-molecular-biology'>molecular biology</a>. We’ve got new ideas about how to think about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#immunology'>immunology</a> and probably also <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#neuroscience'>neuroscience</a>. We’ve got a potential new approach to finding a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#evolutionary-biology'>formalization for biological evolution</a> and its relation to biocomplexity. We’ve got a new concept for “geometrizing” the space of programs—with implications for <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>foundational questions in computational complexity theory</a>. We’ve got a promising way to construct new kinds of theories for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#economics'>economics</a>, with implications, for example, for <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/the-problem-of-distributed-consensus/'>distributed generalizations of blockchain</a>. We’ve got a potential new way to think about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#linguistics'>linguistics</a>, and the structure of meaning space. Oh, and we’ve got a new “physicalized” way to <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#distributed-computing'>conceptualize and organize distributed computing</a>. </p>\n<p>In the nearly half a century that I’ve been doing science, I’ve had the good fortune to be involved in quite a few significant bursts of progress. But I’ve never seen one quite as concentrated and immediate as what we’re now seeing. It’s an exciting thing. But it’s also overwhelming. There’s just so much low-hanging fruit to be picked—so many things with such important potential consequences, for science, technology and the world. </p>\n<p>We’ve been working very hard to move all this forward with the resources we have available. But even though I think we’ve achieved a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/all-by-date/'>remarkable level of productivity</a>, it’s become clear that there’s just too much to do. We’re in the midst of a major “science opportunity overload”. And to be good stewards of the ideas and their potential we’ve got to scale things up. I’ve had lots of experience over decades in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/company'>making big projects happen</a>. And now it’s time to take that experience and define a new structure to move forward the amazing science opportunity we find ourselves with. </p>\n<p>And I think that leaves us no choice: we’ve got to launch the Wolfram Institute, and now!</p>\n<h2 id='maximizing-scientific-productivity-&#038;-communication'>Maximizing Scientific Productivity &#038; Communication</h2>\n<p>In the course of my life I’ve spent a great deal of effort trying to maximize productivity and innovation around the things I do. I’ve done lots of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/'>(arguably nerdy) optimization of my own personal setup</a>. I’ve thought long and hard about the best strategies both for choosing what to do, and for getting things done. But in many ways the most important piece has been the whole structure we’ve built up over the past 35 years at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>.</p>\n<p>I sometimes refer to our company as a machine for turning ideas into real things. And I think it’s been an extremely impressive machine—year after year for more than three decades <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/12/launching-version-13-0-of-wolfram-language-mathematica/'>systematically delivering all sorts of far-reaching innovation</a>, and using our progressive tower of technology to efficiently implement it on larger and larger scales.</p>\n<p>As a company, we’ve mainly been concerned with delivering technology and products. But the systems, culture and methodologies we’ve developed are, at their core, about maximizing innovation and productivity. So what happens if we apply them to science? </p>\n<p><em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> was in a sense a first result, and I consider it an impressive one. Indeed, even nearly 20 years after it was published I’m still amazed at the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-for-chapters/'>sheer volume</a>—and depth—of scientific results that it was possible to obtain in the span of just a single decade.</p>\n<p>But with the Wolfram Physics Project it’s a yet more impressive story. <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/'>We started late in 2019</a>, and in less than six months—with an extremely small team—we were able to make dramatic progress, and to publish nearly 700 pages of material about it. It wouldn’t have been even vaguely possible without the whole tower of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/tools/' target=_blank rel=noopener>computational tooling provided by the Wolfram Language</a>. And nor would it have been possible without the structure and strategy for doing projects that we’ve honed over the past three decades. </p>\n<p>In the past two years, we’ve been energetically moving forward—and we’ve now published altogether <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/' target=_blank rel=noopener>over 2500 pages of new material</a>, as well as nearly <a href='https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframphysics/Tools/guide-page'>200 publicly deployed new functions</a>. In terms of scientific ideas the pace of innovation has been quite breathtaking. But we’ve also been innovating in terms of how to do the science.</p>\n<p>An important objective has been to open the science up to give the widest possible access and potential for engagement. I’ve worked hard to define a style of expository writing that makes what we’ve done accessible to a wide audience as well as to experts. And in what we&#8217;ve published, essentially every graphic has <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>&#8220;click-to-copy&#8221; Wolfram Language code</a>, that anyone can immediately run and build on. We&#8217;ve also <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/archives/index/' target=_blank rel=noopener>uploaded our working notebooks</a>—so far nearly 2000 of them—so that everyone can see not only our “finished product” but also the research (wrong turns and all) that led to it.</p>\n<p>A few years ago I started <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/' target=_blank rel=noopener>livestreaming to the world</a> many of our software design reviews. And building on this concept, we’ve now routinely been <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/physics-project-working-sessions' target=_blank rel=noopener>livestreaming our scientific working sessions</a>—giving people for the first time real-time visibility into how science is done, as well as the possibility to interact with it. And for those interested in an even deeper dive, we’ve also been recording and uploading “<a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/personal-video-worklogs' target=_blank rel=noopener>video work logs</a>”—bringing us up to a total of nearly 1000 hours of video so far.</p>\n<p>Even when we thought we were “just solving physics” we knew we had to involve other people in the project. For 20 years we’ve been doing a very successful annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Summer School</a> about our approach to science and technology, and starting in 2020 we added a <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school/programs/physics/'>track about the Physics Project</a>, as well as a physics Winter School. We’ve had a terrific stream of “students” for our Physics Project. And partly building on this we’ve been setting up a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/people/' target=_blank rel=noopener>network of people involved in the Physics Project</a>—now with 55 members from 20 countries. </p>\n<p>Increasingly, there’s work based on our Physics Project that’s happening in academic institutions, quite independent of us. And no doubt this will bear all sorts of fruit. </p>\n<p>But as we look at the next phases of our Physics Project, and even more so the huge collection of opportunities provided by our <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>new multicomputational paradigm</a>, it’s clear there’s so much to do that—particularly if we want it to happen in years rather than decades—we need a more focused approach.</p>\n<p>And the good news is that through 35 years of experience at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a>, as well as the experience of <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> and the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>, we have an excellent blueprint for what to do. But now we have to implement it at scale. And that’s what the Wolfram Institute is about. </p>\n<h2 id='the-plan-for-the-wolfram-institute'>The Plan for the Wolfram Institute</h2>\n<p>The basic plan is simple: to create a basic-science analog of the immensely productive “machine” that I’ve built at <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/'>Wolfram Research</a> over the past 35 years—and to use this “machine” to accelerate the delivery of new science by many decades if not more. We’ve already got a definite seed: the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Wolfram Physics Project</a>. But now we have to scale this up to the full Wolfram Institute—and give it the structure it needs to grow and take full advantage of the amazing opportunities we now have.</p>\n<p>It’s often assumed that the way to achieve maximum innovation is to put together innovative people, and then let them “just innovate” in whatever directions they choose. But it has been my consistent experience that the greatest innovation is instead achieved when there is a definite “flow” and definite, ambitious goals. The Wolfram Institute is going to be about doing large-scale basic research this way. </p>\n<p>Modeled on Wolfram Research and the Wolfram Physics Project, the idea of the Wolfram Institute is to aggressively pursue basic research that’s explicitly managed and energetically led towards its goals. </p>\n<p>Our initial goals are already tremendously ambitious. We want to use our new paradigm to basically rewrite the foundations of several important fields of science. As with the Physics Project there’ll no doubt be tremendous synergy with existing approaches and the communities around them. But with the paradigm we now have, the tools and methods we’ve developed, and the organizational framework we’re defining for the Wolfram Institute, I think we have the opportunity to jump ahead, and in effect to deliver foundational science that would otherwise emerge at best only in the distant future. </p>\n<p>It’s going to be an exciting thing to be a part of, and—as with projects I’ve done in the past—there are going to be many outstanding people who want to be involved. Our many decades of activity in science and technology have provided an extremely broad network of contacts, and we’ve developed a particularly concentrated pipeline of worldwide talent through our annual <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-school'>Summer School</a> (as well as our <a href='https://education.wolfram.com/summer-camp/'>High School Summer Camp</a>).</p>\n<p>What will the Wolfram Institute be like? There’ll be a leadership core, which, yes, I’m signing up to head. But the main meat of the institute will be a collection of researchers and fellows, working on particular, managed projects—together with students at multiple levels from high school to graduate school. We’ll be doing open science, so there’ll be lots of livestreaming and lots of open tools produced. There’ll be lots of working materials and academic papers published, and whenever we manage to make a big step forward our plan is to present it to the world using the immediate and accessible approach to exposition that I’ve developed.</p>\n<p>In what we’ve done for the past 35 years at Wolfram Research there’s in a sense a clear model for how the organization fundamentally operates. We invent things, then we deliver them in products—and from these products we derive revenue, which is then used to allow us to invent more things and deliver more products. It’s been an extremely productive setup. And because we’re a private company without outside investment we’re able to chart our own course, pursuing the ambitious and long-term projects that we believe in. Often we choose to make things we do freely available to the world, but in the end we rely on the fact that we’re producing commercially valuable products from which we derive revenue that funds our activities. </p>\n<p>There’s no question that the science we’ll be doing at the Wolfram Institute will lead to things of great value to the world. But it won’t be near-term commercial value. And our fundamental model is to concentrate on producing the best and broadest long-term basic research—rather than to aim for things that can be deployed directly in specific products that provide immediate value to specific customers.</p>\n<p>In a sense, our “customer” is the world at large—and the future. But in the present we need a way to support our researchers and fellows. So far we’ve basically been incubating the Wolfram Institute within our existing organization, with me effectively footing the bill. But as we launch the full Wolfram Institute we need a larger scale of support, and we’re counting on having a network of people and organizations to provide that.</p>\n<p>Some of the support will be for specific researchers, fellows or students, perhaps drawn from particular geographies, backgrounds or communities. Some of it will be for specific projects. But it’s also important to have a stable core of support that will allow the institute to pursue long-term basic research that will likely deliver many of its most valuable results through developments that are in effect computationally irreducible to predict in advance.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to know how society at large should value the general activity of basic research, and it’s easy to criticize the inefficiencies of a large-scale “just let researchers do what they want” approach. But with the Wolfram Institute we have a very different model. We’re starting the institute right now for a specific reason: we’ve got a new paradigm that’s just opened up an amazing collection of possibilities. And we plan to pursue those possibilities in an efficient and tightly managed way, optimized for innovation and new ideas.</p>\n<p>When I look at our Physics Project and what we’ve achieved so far with it, I’m frankly amazed at how quickly and comparatively frugally we’ve managed to do it. (Yes, it helps that at least so far we need only people and computers, not telescopes and particle accelerators.) And as we scale this up to all the various projects we plan at the Wolfram Institute, it’s almost absurd how much of long-term significance I expect we will be able to deliver for how comparatively little.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Physics Project has been done as an entirely geodistributed project—building on the 30+ years of experience with coherent geodistributed work that we’ve had at Wolfram Research. And even though its projects will be tightly managed, the Wolfram Institute will also primarily be geodistributed, although we plan regular physical events and we’ll probably have some physical locations available. </p>\n<p>It’s been great in working on the Wolfram Physics Project to have what we’ve been doing be so open, and to be able to share it with so many people. And as we launch the Wolfram Institute I’m looking forward to having all sorts of people involved, both within the institute, and as supporters of it.</p>\n<p>It’s been exciting these past many months seeing the whole multicomputational paradigm emerge, and seeing more and more possibilities reveal themselves. It’s a remarkable—if overwhelming—collection of opportunities, and I believe a historic moment for the progress of science. And as we launch the Wolfram Institute I hope that with the help of enough supporters we’ll be able to deliver many dramatic results that will have great long-term value to the world and to the arc of intellectual history. </p>\n<div class=\"purplestripe\">\n<strong>Learn more about our plans: <a href=\"mailto:institute@wolframfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\">contact the Wolfram Institute team &#187;</a></strong>\n</div>\n",

And indeed with the view of physical space that’s been almost universally adopted for the past two thousand years it’s basically a non-question. As crystallized by the likes of Euclid it’s been assumed that space is ultimately just a kind of “geometrical background” into which any physical thing can be put—and then moved around. </p>\n<p>But in our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> we’ve developed a fundamentally different view of space—in which space is not just a background, but has its <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>own elaborate composition and structure</a>. And in fact, we posit that space is in a sense everything that exists, and that all “things” are ultimately just features of the structure of space. We imagine that at the lowest level, space consists of large numbers of abstract “atoms of space” connected in a hypergraph that’s continually getting updated according to definite rules and that’s a huge version of something like this:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 3px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822Zimg1.png\" alt='' title='' width='578' height='219' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822Yimg1_copy-v3.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span id=\"more-36204\"></span></p>\n<p>But with this setup, what even is motion? It’s no longer something baked into our basic ideas about space. Instead—much like the ancient philosophers imagined—it’s something we can try to derive from a lower level of description. It’s not something we can take for granted—and indeed it’s going to turn out that its character depends in fundamental ways on issues like <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>our nature as observers</a>.</p>\n<p>To have a concept of motion, one has to have not only a concept of space—and time—but also a concept of “things”. One has to have something definite that one can imagine moves through space with time. And in effect the concept of “pure motion” is that there can be a “thing” that “just moves” without “changing its character”. But if the thing is “made of atoms of space” that are continually getting updated, what does this mean? Somehow the identity of the “thing” has to be associated with some collective characteristic that doesn’t depend on the particular atoms of space from which it’s made.</p>\n<p>There’s an immediate analogy here. Consider something like a vortex in a fluid. The vortex can move around as a “thing” even though “underneath” it’s made of an ever-changing collection of lots of discrete molecules. If we looked in microscopic detail, we’d see effects from those discrete molecules. But at the scale at which we humans typically operate, we just consider there to be a definite “thing” we describe as a vortex—that at this level of description exhibits “pure motion”.</p>\n<p>Our fundamental model of space is not so different from this. At the lowest level there’s continual activity associated with the application of rules that create new atoms of space and new connections between them. And just as continual collisions between molecules in a fluid “knit together” the structure of the fluid, so also the continual rewriting of the hypergraph that connects atoms of space knits together the structure of space. But then on top of this there can be “localized collective features” that have a certain persistence. And these are the “things” (or “objects”) that we can consider to “show pure motion”.</p>\n<p>Physics suggests two kinds of things like this. The first are particles, like electrons or photons or quarks. And the second are black holes. As of now, we have no specific evidence that particles like electrons are “made of anything”; they just seem to act like geometrical points. But in our Physics Project we posit that they are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#elementary-particles-old-and-new'>ultimately &#8220;made of space&#8221;</a> and actually contain large numbers of atoms of space that collectively form some kind of persistent structure a bit like a vortex in a fluid. </p>\n<p>Black holes operate on a very different scale—though I suspect they’re actually very similar in character to particles. And in fact for black holes <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>we already have a sense</a> from traditional general relativity that they can just be “made of space”—though without our discrete underlying model there are some inevitable mathematical hacks involved.</p>\n<p>So what is it that leads to persistent structures? Often one can identify it as something “topological”. There’s an underlying “medium” in which all sorts of essentially continuous changes can be made. But then there are structures that can’t be created or destroyed by such continuous changes—in effect because they are “topologically distinct”. Vortices are one such example—because around the core of the vortex, independent of what “continuous deformations” one makes, there’s always a constant circulation of fluid, that can’t be gotten rid of except by some kind of discontinuous change. (In reality, of course, vortices are eventually damped out by viscosity generated as a result of microscopic motion, but the point is that this takes a while, and until it’s happened, the vortex can reasonably be considered to persistently be a “thing”.)</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, we’ve already been able to figure out quite a bit about how black holes work. We know less about the specifics of how particles work. But the basic idea is that somehow there are features that are local and persistent that we can identify as particles—and perhaps these features have topological origins that make it inevitable that, for example, all electrons “intrinsically seem the same”, and that there are only a discrete set of possible types of particles (at least at our energy scales).</p>\n<p>So in the end what we imagine is that there are certain “carriers of pure motion”: certain collective features of space that are persistent enough that we can consider them to “just move”, without changing. At the outset it’s not obvious that any such features should exist at all, and that pure motion should ever be possible. Unlike in the traditional “pure geometrical” view of space, in our Physics Project it’s something one has to explicitly derive from the underlying structure of the model—though it seems quite likely that it’s ultimately an inevitable and ubiquitous consequence of rather general “topological” features of hypergraph rewriting. </p>\n<p>We keep on talking about “features that persist”. But what does this really mean? As soon as something moves it’ll be made of different atoms of space. So what does it mean for it to “persist”? In the end it’s all about what observers perceive. Do we view it as being the “same thing” but in a different place? Or do we say it’s different because some detail of it is different?</p>\n<p>And actually this kind of issue already comes up even before we’re talking about motion and the persistence of “objects”: it’s crucial just in the emergence of the basic notion of space itself. At the level of individual atoms of space there isn’t anything we can really call “space”, just like at the level of individual molecules there isn’t anything we can reasonably call a fluid. And instead, the notion of space—or of fluids—emerges when we look at things in the kind of way that observers like us do. We’re not tracking what’s happening at the level of individual atoms of space—or individual molecules; we’re looking at things in a more coarse-grained way, that it turns out we can summarize in terms of what amount to continuum concepts.</p>\n<p>Once again, it’s not obvious things will work like this. Down at the level of atoms of space—or, for that matter, molecules—there are definite computational rules being followed. And from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> it’s almost inevitable that there’ll be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>, implying that there’s no way to find the outcome except in effect by doing an irreducible amount of computational work. If we as observers were computationally unbounded then, yes, we could always “decode” what’s going on, and “see down” to the behavior of individual atoms of space or individual molecules. But if we’re computationally bounded we can’t do this. And, as I’ve argued <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>elsewhere</a>, that’s both why we believe in the Second Law of thermodynamics, and why we perceive there to be something like ordinary “geometrical space”. </p>\n<p>In other words, our inability to track the details means that in a first approximation we can summarize what’s going on just by saying we’ve got something that seems like our ordinary notion of space. And going one step beyond that is what has us talking about “persistent objects in space”. But now we’re back to discussing what it means for an object to “be persistent”. Ultimately it’s that we as observers somehow perceive it to “be the same”, even though perhaps in a “different place”. </p>\n<p>A key finding of our Physics Project is that certain basic laws of physics—in particular general relativity and quantum mechanics—inevitably seem to emerge as soon as we assume that observers have two basic characteristics: first, that they are computationally bounded, and second, that they are persistent in time.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project the passage of time corresponds to the inexorable (and irreducible) computational process of updating the “spatial hypergraph” that represents the lowest-level structure of the universe. And when we talk formally we can imagine looking at this “from the outside”. But in reality we as observers must be embedded within the system, being continually updated and changed just like the rest of the system.</p>\n<p>But here there’s a crucial point. Even though the particular configuration of atoms in our brains is continually changing, we think it’s “still us”. Or, in other words, we have the perception that we persist through time. Now it could be that this wouldn’t be a consistent thing to imagine, and that if we imagined it, we’d never be able to form a coherent view of the world. But in fact what our Physics Project implies is that with this assumption we can (subject to various conditions) form a coherent view of the world, and it’s one where the core known laws of physics are in evidence.</p>\n<p>OK, so we ourselves are persistent essentially because we assume that we are (and in most situations nothing goes wrong if we do this). But the persistence of something like a particle, or a black hole, is a different story. From our point of view, we’re not “inside” things like these; instead we’re “looking at them from the outside”. </p>\n<p>But what do we notice in them? Well, that depends on our “powers of observation”. The basic idea of particles, for example, is that they should be objects that can somehow be separated from each other and from everything else. In our Physics Project, though, any particle must ultimately be “embedded as a part of space”. So when we say that it’s a “separable object” what we’re imagining is just that there’s some attribute of it that we can identify and observe independent of its “environment”. </p>\n<p>But just what this is can depend on our characteristics as observers, and the fact that we operate on certain scales of length and time. If we were able to go down to the level of individual atoms of space we probably wouldn’t be able to “see” that there’s anything like a particle there at all. That’s something that emerges for observers with our kinds of characteristics.</p>\n<p>Quite what the full spectrum of “conceivable persistent features” might be isn’t clear (though we’ll see some exotic possibilities below). But as soon as one can identify a persistent feature, one can ask about motion. Is it possible for that feature to “move” from being embedded at one “place” to another?</p>\n<p>There’s yet another subtlety here, though. Our ordinary experience of motion involves things going from one place to another by progressively “visiting every place in between”. But ultimately, as soon as we’re dealing with discrete atoms of space, this can’t be how things work. And instead what we need to discuss is whether something somehow “maintains its form” at intermediate stages as it “moves”.</p>\n<p>For example, we probably wouldn’t consider it motion in the ordinary sense if what we had was a kind of <em>Star Trek</em>&#8211;like “transporter” in which objects get completely disassembled, then get “transmitted to a different place” and reassembled. But somehow it does seem more like “ordinary motion” if there’s a collection of pixel values that move across a computer screen—even if at intermediate moments they are distorted by all sorts of aliasing effects.</p>\n<p>Even in ordinary general relativity there are issues with the idea of motion—at least for extended objects. If we’re in a region of space that’s reasonably flat it’s fine. But if we’re near a spacetime singularity then inevitably objects won’t be able to “maintain their integrity”—and instead they’ll effectively be “shredded”—and so can’t be interpreted as “just moving”. When we’re dealing not with geometric continuum spacetime but instead with our spatial hypergraph, there’ll always be something analogous to “shredding” on a small enough scale, and the question is whether at the level we perceive things we’ll be able to tell that there’s something persistent that isn’t shredded.</p>\n<p>So, in the end, how is it that things can move? Ultimately it’s something that has to be formally derived from the underlying model, based on the characteristics of the observer. At least conceptually the first step is to identify what kinds of things the observer considers “the same”, and what details make them “seem different”. Then one needs to determine whether there are structures that would be considered the same by the observer, but which progressively change ”where they’re embedded”. And if so, we’ve identified “motion”.</p>\n<p>For us humans with our current state of technological development, particles and objects made of them are the most obvious things to consider. So in a sense the question reduces to whether there are “lumps of space” that persist in maintaining (perhaps topological) features recognized by our powers of perception. And to determine this is a formal question that’s important to explore as our Physics Project progresses.</p>\n<h2 id='motion-can-be-a-complicated-story'>Motion Can Be a Complicated Story</h2>\n<p>We’ve talked about “persistent structures” as “carriers of pure motion”. But how do such structures actually work? Ultimately it can be a very complicated story. But here we’ll consider a simplified case that begins to illustrate some of the issues. We’ll be talking not about the actual model of space in our Physics Project, but instead about the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/'>cellular automaton systems</a> I’ve studied for many years in which space is effectively predefined to consist of a rigid array of cells, each with a discrete value updated according to a local rule. </p>\n<p>Here’s an example in which there quickly emerge obvious “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p282--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>localized persistent structures</a>” that we can think of as being roughly like particles:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 5px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img2.png\" alt='' title='' width='578' height='289' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Some “stay still” relative to the fixed cellular automaton background; others “move”.

But to expect otherwise is to imagine an idealization in which there is at some level “only one object” in the whole system. As soon as there are multiple objects it’s basically inevitable that they’ll eventually interact. Or, put another way, motion in any real situation will never be about “persistently moving” forever; it’s just about persisting for at least long enough to be identified as something separate and definite. (This is very similar to the situation in quantum field theory where actual particles eventually interact, even though their formal definition assumes no interaction.) </p>\n<p>Here’s another case, where on a large scale there’s no “obvious motion” to be seen</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 5px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img6.png\" alt='' title='' width='578' height='289' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img6_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='6_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='6_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>but where locally one can identify rather simple “particle-like” structures</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 5px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img7.png\" alt='' title='' width='578' height='181' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>that on their own can be thought of as “exhibiting motion”, even though there are other structures that for example just expand, apparently without bound:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: -3px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img8.png\" alt='' title='' width='578' height='246' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='8_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='8_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Sometimes there can be lots of “particle-like” activity, but with other things consistently mixed in:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: -3px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img9.png\" alt='' title='' width='577' height='346' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img9_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='9_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='9_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here’s a slightly more exotic example, where continual “streams of particles” are produced:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 5px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img10.png\" alt='' title='' width='575' height='297' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img10_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='10_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='10_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In all the examples we’ve seen so far the “particles” exist on a “blank” or otherwise simple background.

The most important point is that we’ve seen that “objects” that can be thought of as “showing pure motion” can emerge even in underlying systems that don’t seem to have any particular “built-in concept of motion”. But what we’ve also seen is that along with “objects that show pure motion” there can be all sorts of other effects and phenomena. And in our actual Physics Project these can necessarily in a sense be much more extreme. </p>\n<p>The cellular automaton systems we’ve been discussing so far have a built-in underlying notion of space, which exists even if the system basically “doesn’t do anything”.

But we don’t yet know the details, and there’s probably quite a depth of mathematical formalism that needs to be built to clarify them.

But so far there’s an important piece we’ve left out. Because in effect we’ve assumed that the observer is “outside the system” and “looking in”. But if we imagine that we’re dealing with a complete model of the physical universe the observer necessarily has to “be inside”. And ultimately the observer has got to be “made of the same stuff” as whatever thing it is to which we’re attributing motion.</p>\n<p>How does an observer observe? Ultimately whatever is “happening in the outside world” must affect the observer, and the observer must change as a result. Our Physics Project has a fundamental way to think about change, in terms of elementary “updating events”. In addition to imagining that space is made up of discrete “atoms of space”, we imagine that change is made up of discrete “atoms of change” or “events”.</p>\n<p>In the hypergraph that represents space and everything in it, each event updates (or “rewrites”) the hypergraph, by “consuming” some collection of hyperedges, and generating a new collection. But actually events are a more general concept that don’t for example depend on having an underlying hypergraph. We can just think of them as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>consuming collections of &#8220;tokens&#8221;</a>, whatever they may be, and generating new ones. </p>\n<p>But events satisfy a very important constraint, which in some sense is responsible for the very existence of what we think of as time. And the constraint is that for any event to happen, all the tokens it’s going to consume have to exist. But those tokens have to have “come from somewhere”. And at least if we ignore what happens “at the very beginning” every token that’s going to be consumed has to have been generated by some other event. In other words, there’s a certain necessary ordering among events. And we can capture this by constructing a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/events-and-their-causal-relationships/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal graph</a> that captures the causal relationships that must exist between events.</p>\n<p>As a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/causal-foliations-and-causal-cones/#p-237' target=_blank rel=noopener>simple example</a>, here’s a system that consists of a string of As and Bs, and in which each “updating event” (indicated as a yellow box) corresponds to an application of the rule BA&#8594;AB:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822Zimg2.png\" alt='' title='' width='496' height='387' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822Zimg2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here’s the causal graph for this superimposed:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822Zimg3.png\" alt='' title='' width='496' height='387' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822Zimg3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Imagine that some collection of characters on the left-hand side represents “an observer”. <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p516--space-time-and-relativity/'>The only way this observer can be affected</a> by what happens on the right-hand side is as a result of its events being affected by events on the right-hand side. But what event is affected by what other event is exactly what the causal graph defines. And so in the end we can say that what the observer can “perceive” is just the causal graph of causal relationships between events.</p>\n<p>“From the outside” we might see some particular “absolute” arrangement of events in the cellular-automaton-like picture above. But the point is that “from the inside” the observer can’t perceive this “absolute arrangement”. All they can perceive is the causal graph. Or, put another way, the observer doesn’t have any “absolute knowledge” of the system; all they “know about” is “effects on them”.</p>\n<p>So what does this imply about motion? In something like a cellular automaton there’s a fixed concept of space that we typically “look at from the outside”—and we can readily “see what’s moving” relative to that fixed, absolute “background space”. But in something like our Physics Project we imagine that any observer must be inside the system, able to “tell what’s going on” only from the causal graph.</p>\n<p>In standard physics we might posit that to find out “where something is” we’d have to probe it, say with light signals. Here we’ve broken everything down to the level of elementary events and we’re in some sense “representing everything that can happen” in terms of the causal graph of relationships between events.</p>\n<p>And in fact as soon as we assume that our “perceived reality” has to be based on the causal graph, we’ve inevitably abandoned any absolute notion of space. All we as observers can know is “relative information”, defined for us by the causal graph.</p>\n<p>Looking at our BA&#8594;AB system above we can see that “viewed from the outside” there’s a lot of arbitrariness in “when we do” each update. But it turns out that none of this matters to the causal graph we construct—because this particular underlying system has the property of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal invariance</a>, which makes the causal graph have the same structure independent of these choices. And in general whenever there’s causal invariance (which there inevitably will be at least at the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ultimate level of the ruliad</a>) this has the important implication that there’s <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p516--space-time-and-relativity/'>relativistic invariance in the system</a>.</p>\n<p>We won’t go into this in detail here. Because while it certainly affects the specifics of how motion works there are more fundamental issues to discuss about the underlying concept of motion itself. </p>\n<p>We’ve already discussed the idea that observers like us posit our own persistence through time. But now we can be a bit more precise—and say that what we really posit is that we “follow the causal graph”. It could be that our perception samples all sorts of events—that we might think of as being “all over spacetime”. But in fact we assume that we don’t “jump around the causal graph”, and that instead our experiences are based on “coherent paths” through the causal graph.</p>\n<p>We never in any absolute sense “know where we are”. But we construct our notion of place by positing that we exist at a definite—and in a sense “coherent”—place, relative to which we perceive other things. If our perception of “where we are” could “jump around” the causal graph, we’d never be able to define a coherent concept of pure motion. </p>\n<p>To make this a little bit “more practical” let’s discuss (as <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/'>I did some time ago</a>) the question of faster-than-light travel in our Physics Project. By the very definition of the causal graph the effect of one event on another is represented by the presence of a “causal path” between the events within the graph. We can assume that “traversing” each “causal edge” (i.e. going from one event to the next) takes a certain elementary time. But to work out “how fast the effect propagated” we need to know how “far away in space” the event that was affected is.</p>\n<p>But recall that all the observer ultimately has available is the causal graph. So any questions about “distances in space” have to be deduced from the causal graph. And the nature of the observer—and the assumptions they make about themselves—inevitably affect the deductions they make. </p>\n<p>Imagine a causal graph that is mostly a grid, but suppose there is a single edge that “jumps across the grid”, connecting events that would otherwise be distant in the graph. If we as observers were sensitive to that single edge it’d make us think that the two events it joins are “very close together”. But if we look only at the “bulk structure” of the causal graph, we’d ignore that edge in our definition of the “layout of space”, and consider it only as some kind of “microscopic anomaly”. </p>\n<p>So should we in fact <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/#to-travel-to-communicate'>include that single edge when we define our concept of motion</a>? If we posit that we “exist at a definite place” then the presence of such an edge in what “constitutes us” means the “place we’re at” must extend to wherever in the causal graph the edge reaches. But if there are enough “stray edges” (or in general <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/#can-we-make-tunnels-in-space'>what I call &#8220;space tunnels&#8221;</a>) we as observers would inevitably get very “delocalized”.</p>\n<p>To be able to “observe motion” we’d better be observers who can coherently form a notion of space in which there can be consistent “local places”. And if there’s some elaborate pattern of space tunnels this could potentially be broken. Although ultimately it won’t be unless the space tunnels are somehow coherent enough to “get observers like us through them”.</p>\n<p>Earlier we saw that the concept of motion depends on the idea that we as observers can identify “things” as “persistent” relative to the “background structure of space”. And now we can see that in fact motion depends on a certain persistence in time and “coherence” in place not only for the “thing” we posit is moving, but also for us as observers observing it.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine that both time and space are fundamentally discrete. But the concept of persistence—or “coherence”—implies that at least at the level of our perception there must be a certain effectively continuous character to them. There’s a certain resonance with things like Zeno’s paradoxes. Yes, our models may define only what happens at a sequence of discrete steps. But the perception that we persistently exist will make us effectively fill in all the “intervening moments”—to form what we experience as a “continuous thread of existence”. </p>\n<p>The idea that pure motion is possible is thus intimately connected to the idea of the continuum. Pure motion in a sense posits that there is some kind of “thread of existence” for “things” that leads from one place and time to another. But ultimately all that’s relevant is that observers like us perceive there to be such a thread. And the whole point is that the possibility of such perception can be deduced as a matter of formal derivation from the structure of the underlying model and general characteristics of us as observers.</p>\n<p>But in describing our perception what we’ll tend to do is to talk in terms of the continuum. Because that’s the level of description at which we can abstractly discuss pure motion, without having to get into the mechanics of how it happens. And in effect the “derivation of pure motion” is thus directly connected to the “derivation of the continuum”: pure motion is in a sense an operational consequence not necessarily of an actual continuum world, but of a continuum perception of the world by an embedded observer like us.</p>\n<h2 id='motion-beyond-physical-space:-the-branchial-case'>Motion beyond Physical Space: The Branchial Case</h2>\n<p>Our everyday experience of motion has to do with ordinary, physical space. But the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> inspired by our Physics Project inevitably leads to other kinds of space—that are different in character and interpretation from ordinary, physical space, but have deep analogies to it. So in the context of these other kinds of space, what analogs of the concept of “pure motion” might there be?</p>\n<p>Let’s talk first about <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space</a>, which in our Physics Project is interpreted as the space of quantum states. To approach this from a simple example, let’s consider the multiway graph generated by applying the rule {A&#8594;AB,B&#8594;A} in all possible ways to each “state”: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 5px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img21.png\" alt='' title='' width='529' height='274' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/sw031822img21_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='21_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='21_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We can think of each path through this graph as defining a possible history for the system, leading to a complicated pattern of possible “threads of history”, sometimes branching and sometimes merging. But now consider taking a “branchial slice” across this system—and then characterizing the “multicomputational behavior” of the system by constructing what we call the branchial graph by joining states that share an ancestor on the step before: </p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img style=\"margin-left: 5px\" class='' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/finalimagev5.png\" alt='' title='' width='522' height='258' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/03/finalimagev4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='22_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For physics, we interpret the nodes of these graphs as quantum states, so that the branchial graph effectively gives us a “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/quantum-formalism/' target=_blank rel=noopener>map of quantum entanglements</a>” between states. And just like for the hypergraph that we imagine defines the relations between the atoms of physical space, we think about the limit of a very large branchial graph—that gives us what we can call branchial space. As we’ve <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-forms-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>discussed elsewhere</a>, branchial space is in many ways much wilder than ordinary, physical space, and is for example probably exponential-dimensional.</p>\n<p>In basic quantum mechanics, distances in branchial space are probably related to differences in phase between quantum amplitudes. In more complicated cases they probably correspond to more complicated transformations between quantum states. So how might we think about “motion” in branchial space?</p>\n<p>Although we’ve <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/matter-energy-and-gravitation/' target=_blank rel=noopener>discussed it at length elsewhere</a>, we didn’t above talk about what we might call “bulk motion” in physical space, as effectively produced by the curvature of space associated with gravity. But in branchial space there <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/correspondence-between-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>seems to be a directly analogous phenomenon</a>—in which the presence of energy (which corresponds to the density of activity in the system) leads to an effective curvature in branchial space which deflects all paths, in a way that seems to produce the change of quantum phase specified by the path integral. </p>\n<p>But can we identify specific things moving and preserving their identity in branchial space, as we can identify things like particles moving in physical space? It’s a tricky story, incompletely figured out, and deeply connected to issues of quantum measurement. But just like in physical space, an important issue is to define what “observers like us” are like. And a crucial first step is to realize that—as entities embedded in the universe—we must inevitably have multiple histories. So to ask how we perceive what happens in the universe is in effect to ask how a “branching mind” perceives a branching universe. </p>\n<p>And the crucial point—directly analogous to what we’ve discussed in the case of physical space—is that whatever one might be able to “see from outside”, we “internally” assume that we as observers have a certain persistence and coherence. In particular, even though “from the outside” the multiway graph might show many branching threads of history, our perception is that we have a single thread of experience. </p>\n<p>In ordinary quantum mechanics, it’s quite tricky to see how this “conflation of threads of history” interacts even with “bulk motion” in branchial space. Typically, as in traditional quantum measurement, one just considers “snapshots” at particular times. Yes, one can imagine that things like <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/wave-particle-duality-uncertainty-relations-etc/' target=_blank rel=noopener>wave packets spread out in branchial space</a>, but—a bit like discussing “motion” for gravitational fields or even gravitational waves in spacetime—there isn’t the same kind of systematic concept of pure motion that we’ve encountered with things like particles in physical space.</p>\n<p>When we get to quantum field theory—or the full quantum gravity associated with our models—it will probably be a different story. Perhaps we can view certain configurations of quantum fields as being like structures in branchial space, that an observer will consider to be localized and persistent. Indeed, it’s easy to imagine that in the branchial graph—or even more so the multiway causal graph—there may be things like “topologically stable” structures that we can reasonably think of as “things that move”. But just what the character and interpretation of such things might be, we don’t yet know.</p>\n<h2 id='motion-in-rulial-space'>Motion in Rulial Space</h2>\n<p>There’s physical space, and there’s branchial space. But in a sense the ultimate kind of space is rulial space. The story begins with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>, which represents the entangled limit of all possible computations. The ruliad is what we imagine underlies not only physics <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/'>but also mathematics</a>. When we “experience physics” we’re sampling a certain slice of the ruliad that’s accessible to physical observers like us. And when we “experience mathematics” we’re sampling a slice of the ruliad that’s accessible to “mathematical observers” like us. </p>\n<p>So what do different “places” in rulial space correspond to? Fundamentally they’re different choices for the rules we sample from the ruliad. Ultimately everything is part of the unique object that is the ruliad. But at different places in the ruliad we’ll have different specific experiences as observers.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, though, there’s a translation that can be made. It’s basically like the situation with different computational systems that—according to the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>—are generically universal: there’s always an “interpreter” that can be created in one system that can translate to the other.</p>\n<p>In a sense the idea of different places in rulial space is quite familiar from our everyday experience. Because it’s directly analogous to the idea that different minds “parse” and “experience” the world differently. Whether one’s talking about a human brain or an artificial neural net, the details of its past experience will cause it to represent things in the world in different ways, and to process them differently.</p>\n<p>At the very lowest level, the components of the systems will—like any other universal computer—be able to emulate the detailed operations of other systems. But at this level there are no “things that are moving from one place to another in rulial space”; everything is just being “atomized”.</p>\n<p>So are there in fact robust structures that can “move across rulial space”? The <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#communicating-across-rulial-space'>answer, I think, is yes</a>. But it’s a strange story. I suspect that the analog in rulial space of particles in physical space is basically concepts—say of the kind that might be represented by words in a human <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>(or computational) language</a>.</p>\n<p>Imagine thinking about a cat. There’s a particular representation of a cat in one’s brain—and in detail it’ll be different from the representation in anyone else’s brain. But now imagine using the word “cat”, or in some way communicating the concept of “cat”. The “cat” concept is something robust, that we’re used to seeing “transmitted” from one brain to another—even though different brains represent it differently.</p>\n<p>Things might not work this way. It could be that there’d be no robust way to transmit anything about the thinking going on in one brain to another brain. But that’s where the idea of concepts comes in. They’re an abstracted way to “transport” some feature of thinking in one brain to another.</p>\n<p>And in a sense they’re a reflection of the possibility of pure motion in rulial space: they’re a way to have some kind of persistent “thing” that can be traced across rulial space. </p>\n<p>But just like our examples of motion, the way this works depends on the characteristics of the observers observing it—and insofar as we are the observers, it therefore depends on us. We know from experience that we form concepts, and that they have a certain robustness. But why is this? In a sense, concepts are a way of coarse-graining things so that we—as computationally bounded entities—can deal with them. And the fact that we take concepts to maintain some kind of fixed meaning is part of our perception that we maintain a single persistent thread of experience.</p>\n<p>It is strange to think that something as explicit and concrete as an electron in physical space could in some sense be similar to an abstract concept like “cat”. But this is the kind of thing that happens when one has something as fundamental and general as the ruliad underlying everything.</p>\n<p>We know that our general characteristics as observers inevitably lead to certain general laws of physics. And so similarly we can expect that our general characteristics as observers will lead to certain general laws about the overall representation of things. Perhaps we’ll be able to identify analogs of energy and gravity and quantum mechanics. But a first step is to identify the analog of motion, and the kinds of things which can exhibit pure motion.</p>\n<p>In physical space, particles like electrons are our basic “carriers of motion”. In rulial space “concepts” seem to be our best description of the “carriers of motion” (though there are presumably higher-level constructs too, like analogies and syntactic structures). And, yes, it might seem very odd to say that something as apparently human-centered as “concepts” can be associated with something as fundamental as motion. But as we’ve emphasized several times here, “pure motion” is something that relies on the observer, and on the observer having what amounts to a “sensory apparatus” that considers a “thing” to maintain a persistent character. So when it comes to the representation of “arbitrary content” it’s not surprising that we as observers have to talk about the fundamental way we think about things, and about constructs like concepts.</p>\n<p>But are things like concepts the only kind of persistent structures that can exist in rulial space? They’re ones that we as observers can readily parse out of the ruliad—based for example on the particular ways of thinking that we’ve embraced so far in our intellectual development. But we can certainly imagine that there’s the possibility for “robust communication” independent, for example, of human minds.</p>\n<p>There’s a great tendency, though, to try to relate things back to human constructs. For example, we might consider a machine-learning system that’s successfully discovered a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/#the-concept-of-concepts'>distinction that can repeatedly be used</a> for some purpose. And, yes, we can imagine “transporting” that to a different system. But we’ll tend to think of this again in terms of some “feature” or “concept”, even though, for example, we might not happen (at least yet) to have some word for it in a human language, or a computational language intended for use by humans.</p>\n<p>We can similarly talk about communication with or between other animals, or, more ambitiously, we can discuss <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/01/showing-off-to-the-universe-beacons-for-the-afterlife-of-our-civilization/'>communications with or between &#8220;alien intelligences&#8221;</a>. We might assume that we would be able to say nothing about such cases. But ultimately we imagine that everything is represented somewhere in the ruliad. And in effect by doing things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-3--the-world-of-simple-programs/'>exploring arbitrarily chosen programs</a> we can investigate possible “raw material” for “alien intelligence”.</p>\n<p>And it’s then at some level a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>matter of science</a>—or, more specifically, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>—to try to identify “transportable elements” between different programs, or, in effect, between different places in rulial space. At a simple level we might say we’re looking for “common principles”—which puts us back to something like “concepts”. But in general we can imagine a more elaborate computational structure for our “transportable elements” in rulial space.</p>\n<p>In physical space we know that we can make “material objects” out of particles like electrons and quarks, and then “move these around” in physical space. Within the domain of “human-thinking rulial space” we can do something analogous with descriptions “made from known concepts”. And in both cases we can imagine that there are more general constructs that are “possible”, even though we human observers as we are now might not be able to “parse them out of the ruliad”.</p>\n<p>The constraints of computational boundedness and perception of persistence are probably pretty fundamental to any form of experience that can be connected to us. But as we develop what amount to new sensory capabilities or new ways of thinking we can expect that our “range” as observers will at least somewhat increase. </p>\n<p>And in a sense our very exploration of the concept of motion here can be thought of as a way to make possible a little bit more motion in rulial space. The concept of motion is a very general one. And one that we now see is deeply tied into ideas about observers and multicomputation. The question of how things can move is the same one that was asked in antiquity. But the tower of ideas that we can now bring to bear in answering is very different, and it’s sobering to see just how far we really were earlier in intellectual history from being able to meaningfully address it.</p>\n",

But the idea is that they can both be seen as views of the same underlying structure. What makes them different is that physical and mathematical observers sample this structure in somewhat different ways. But since in the end both kinds of observers are associated with human experience they inevitably have certain core characteristics in common. And the result is that there should be “fundamental laws of mathematics” that in some sense mirror the perceived laws of physics that we derive from our physical observation of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>So what might those fundamental laws of mathematics be like? And how might they inform our conception of the foundations of mathematics, and our view of what mathematics really is?</p>\n<p>The most obvious manifestation of the mathematics that we humans have developed over the course of many centuries is the few million mathematical theorems that have been published in the literature of mathematics. But what can be said in generality about this thing we call mathematics? Is there some notion of what mathematics is like “in bulk”? And what might we be able to say, for example, about the structure of mathematics in the limit of infinite future development?</p>\n<p>When we do physics, the traditional approach has been to start from our basic sensory experience of the physical world, and of concepts like space, time and motion—and then to try to formalize our descriptions of these things, and build on these formalizations. And in its early development—for example by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>Euclid</a>—mathematics took the same basic approach. But beginning a little more than a century ago there emerged the idea that one could build mathematics purely from formal axioms, without necessarily any reference to what is accessible to sensory experience.</p>\n<p>And in a way our Physics Project begins from a similar place. Because at the outset it just considers purely abstract structures and abstract rules—typically described in terms of hypergraph rewriting—and then tries to deduce their consequences. Many of these consequences are incredibly complicated, and full of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>. But the remarkable discovery is that when sampled by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers with certain general characteristics that make them like us</a>, the behavior that emerges must generically have regularities that we can recognize, and in fact must follow exactly known core laws of physics.</p>\n<p>And already this begins to suggest a new perspective to apply to the foundations of mathematics. But there’s another piece, and that’s the idea of the ruliad. We might have supposed that our universe is based on some particular chosen underlying rule, like an axiom system we might choose in mathematics. But the concept of the ruliad is in effect to represent the entangled result of “running all possible rules”. And the key point is then that it turns out that an “observer like us” sampling the ruliad must perceive behavior that corresponds to known laws of physics. In other words, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>without “making any choice” it&#8217;s inevitable</a>—given what we’re like as observers—that our “experience of the ruliad” will show fundamental laws of physics.</p>\n<p>But now we can make a bridge to mathematics. Because in embodying all possible computational processes the ruliad also necessarily embodies the consequences of all possible axiom systems. As humans doing physics we’re effectively taking a certain sampling of the ruliad. And we realize that as humans doing mathematics we’re also doing essentially the same kind of thing. </p>\n<p>But will we see “general laws of mathematics” in the same kind of way that we see “general laws of physics”? It depends on what we’re like as “mathematical observers”. In physics, there turn out to be general laws—and concepts like space and motion—that we humans can assimilate. And in the abstract it might not be that anything similar would be true in mathematics. But it seems as if the thing mathematicians typically call mathematics is something for which it is—and where (usually in the end leveraging our experience of physics) it’s possible to successfully carve out a sampling of the ruliad that’s again one we humans can assimilate. </p>\n<p>When we think about physics we have the idea that there’s an actual physical reality that exists—and that we experience physics within this. But in the formal axiomatic view of mathematics, things are different. There’s no obvious “underlying reality” there; instead there’s just a certain choice we make of axiom system. But now, with the concept of the ruliad, the story is different. Because now we have the idea that “deep underneath” both physics and mathematics there’s the same thing: the ruliad. And that means that insofar as physics is “grounded in reality”, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>so also must mathematics be</a>.</p>\n<p>When most working mathematicians do mathematics it seems to be typical for them to reason as if the constructs they’re dealing with (whether they be numbers or sets or whatever) are “real things”. But usually there’s a concept that in principle one could “drill down” and formalize everything in terms of some axiom system. And indeed if one wants to get a global view of mathematics and its structure as it is today, it seems as if the best approach is to work from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p773--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>formalization that’s been done with axiom systems</a>.</p>\n<p>In starting from the ruliad and the ideas of our Physics Project we’re in effect positing a certain “theory of mathematics”. And to validate this theory we need to study the “phenomena of mathematics”. And, yes, we could do this in effect by directly “reading the whole literature of mathematics”. But it’s more efficient to start from what’s in a sense the “current prevailing underlying theory of mathematics” and to begin by building on the methods of formalized mathematics and axiom systems.</p>\n<p>Over the past century a certain amount of metamathematics has been done by looking at the general properties of these methods. But most often when the methods are systematically used today, it’s to set up some particular mathematical derivation, normally with the aid of a computer. But here what we want to do is think about what happens if the methods are used “in bulk”. Underneath there may be all sorts of specific detailed formal derivations being done. But somehow what emerges from this is something higher level, something “more human”—and ultimately something that corresponds to our experience of pure mathematics.</p>\n<p>How might this work? We can get an idea from an analogy in physics. Imagine we have a gas. Underneath, it consists of zillions of molecules bouncing around in detailed and complicated patterns. But most of our “human” experience of the gas is at a much more coarse-grained level—where we perceive not the detailed motions of individual molecules, but instead continuum fluid mechanics.</p>\n<p>And so it is, I think, with mathematics. All those detailed formal derivations—for example of the kind <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>automated theorem proving</a> might do—are like molecular dynamics. But most of our “human experience of mathematics”—where we talk about concepts like integers or morphisms—is like fluid dynamics. The molecular dynamics is what builds up the fluid, but for most questions of “human interest” it’s possible to “reason at the fluid dynamics level”, without dropping down to molecular dynamics.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly not obvious that this would be possible. It could be that one might start off describing things at a “fluid dynamics” level—say in the case of an actual fluid talking about the motion of vortices—but that everything would quickly get “shredded”, and that there’d soon be nothing like a vortex to be seen, only elaborate patterns of detailed microscopic molecular motions. And similarly in mathematics one might imagine that one would be able to prove theorems in terms of things like real numbers but actually find that everything gets “shredded” to the point where one has to start talking about elaborate issues of mathematical logic and different possible axiomatic foundations.</p>\n<p>But in physics we effectively have the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>Second Law of thermodynamics</a>—which we now <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p441--irreversibility-and-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/'>understand in terms of computational irreducibility</a>—that tells us that there’s a robust sense in which the microscopic details are systematically “washed out” so that things like fluid dynamics “work”. Just sometimes—like in studying Brownian motion, or hypersonic flow—the molecular dynamics level still “shines through”. But for most “human purposes” we can describe fluids just using ordinary fluid dynamics.</p>\n<p>So what’s the analog of this in mathematics? Presumably it’s that there’s some kind of “general law of mathematics” that explains why one can so often do mathematics “purely in the large”. Just like in fluid mechanics there can be “corner-case” questions that probe down to the “molecular scale”—and indeed that’s where we can expect to see things like undecidability, as a rough analog of situations where we end up tracing the potentially infinite paths of single molecules rather than just looking at “overall fluid effects”. But somehow in most cases there’s some much stronger phenomenon at work—that effectively aggregates low-level details to allow the kind of “bulk description” that ends up being the essence of what we normally in practice call mathematics.</p>\n<p>But is such a phenomenon something formally inevitable, or does it somehow depend on us humans “being in the loop”? In the case of the Second Law it’s crucial that we only get to track coarse-grained features of a gas—as we humans with our current technology typically do. Because if instead we watched and decoded what every individual molecule does, we wouldn’t end up identifying anything like the usual bulk “Second-Law” behavior. In other words, the emergence of the Second Law is in effect a direct consequence of the fact that it’s us humans—with our limitations on measurement and computation—who are observing the gas.</p>\n<p>So is something similar happening with mathematics? At the underlying “molecular level” there’s a lot going on. But the way we humans think about things, we’re effectively taking just particular kinds of samples. And those samples turn out to give us “general laws of mathematics” that give us our usual experience of “human-level mathematics”.</p>\n<p><a name='axiomatic-level'></a>To ultimately ground this we have to go down to the fully abstract level of the ruliad, but we’ll already see many core effects by looking at mathematics essentially just at a traditional “axiomatic level”, albeit “in bulk”. </p>\n<p>The full story—and the full correspondence between physics and mathematics—requires in a sense “going below” the level at which we have recognizable formal axiomatic mathematical structures; it requires going to a level at which we’re just talking about making everything out of completely abstract elements, which in physics we might interpret as “atoms of space” and in mathematics as some kind of “symbolic raw material” below variables and operators and everything else familiar in traditional axiomatic mathematics.</p>\n<p>The deep correspondence we’re describing between physics and mathematics might make one wonder to what extent the methods we use in physics can be applied to mathematics, and vice versa. In axiomatic mathematics the emphasis tends to be on looking at particular theorems and seeing how they can be knitted together with proofs. And one could certainly imagine an analogous “axiomatic physics” in which one does particular experiments, then sees how they can “deductively” be knitted together. But our impression that there’s an “actual reality” to physics makes us seek broader laws. And the correspondence between physics and mathematics implied by the ruliad now suggests that we should be doing this in mathematics as well.</p>\n<p>What will we find? Some of it in essence just confirms impressions that working pure mathematicians already have. But it provides a definite framework for understanding these impressions and for seeing what their limits may be. It also lets us address questions like why undecidability is so comparatively rare in practical pure mathematics, and why it is so common to discover remarkable correspondences between apparently quite different areas of mathematics. And beyond that, it suggests a host of new questions and approaches both to mathematics and metamathematics—that help frame the foundations of the remarkable intellectual edifice that we call mathematics. </p>\n<h2 id='the-underlying-structure-of-mathematics-and-physics'><span>2 | </span>The Underlying Structure of Mathematics and Physics</h2>\n<p>If we “drill down” to what we’ve called above the “molecular level” of mathematics, what will we find there? There are many technical details (some of which we’ll discuss later) about the historical conventions of mathematics and its presentation. But in broad outline we can think of there as being a kind of “gas” of “mathematical statements”—like 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 or <em>x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>x</em>—represented in some specified symbolic language. (And, yes, <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a> provides a well-developed example of what that language can be like.)</p>\n<p>But how does the “gas of statements” behave? The essential point is that new statements are derived from existing ones by “interactions” that implement laws of inference (like that <em>q</em> can be derived from the statement <em>p</em> and the statement “<em>p</em> implies <em>q</em>”). And if we trace the paths by which one statement can be derived from others, these correspond to proofs. And the whole graph of all these derivations is then a representation of the possible historical development of mathematics—with slices through this graph corresponding to the sets of statements reached at a given stage.</p>\n<p>By talking about things like a “gas of statements” we’re making this sound a bit like physics. But while in physics a gas consists of actual, physical molecules, in mathematics our statements are just abstract things. But this is where the discoveries of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> start to be important. Because in our project we’re “drilling down” beneath for example the usual notions of space and time to an “ultimate machine code” for the physical universe. And we can think of that ultimate machine code as operating on things that are in effect just abstract constructs—very much like in mathematics.</p>\n<p>In particular, we imagine that space and everything in it is made up of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>giant network (hypergraph) of “atoms of space”</a>—with each “atom of space” just being an abstract element that has certain relations with other elements. The evolution of the universe in time then corresponds to the application of computational rules that (much like laws of inference) take abstract relations and yield new relations—thereby progressively updating the network that represents space and everything in it.</p>\n<p>But while the individual rules may be very simple, the whole detailed pattern of behavior to which they lead is normally very complicated—and typically shows <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>, so that there’s no way to systematically find its outcome except in effect by explicitly tracing each step. But despite all this underlying complexity it turns out—much like in the case of an ordinary gas—that at a coarse-grained level there are much simpler (“bulk”) laws of behavior that one can identify. And the remarkable thing is that these turn out to be exactly general relativity and quantum mechanics (which, yes, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>end up being the same theory</a> when looked at in terms of an appropriate generalization of the notion of space). </p>\n<p>But down at the lowest level, is there some specific computational rule that’s “running the universe”? I don’t think so. Instead, I think that in effect all possible rules are always being applied. And the result is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>: the entangled structure associated with performing all possible computations. </p>\n<p>But what then gives us our experience of the universe and of physics? Inevitably we are observers embedded within the ruliad, sampling only certain features of it. But what features we sample are determined by the characteristics of us as observers. And what seem to be critical to have <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>“observers like us” are basically two characteristics</a>. First, that we are computationally bounded. And second, that we somehow persistently maintain our coherence—in the sense that we can consistently identify what constitutes “us” even though the detailed atoms of space involved are continually changing.</p>\n<p><a name='rulial-space'></a>But we can think of different “observers like us” as taking different specific samples, corresponding to different reference frames in rulial space, or just different positions in rulial space. These different observers may describe the universe as evolving according to different specific underlying rules. But the crucial point is that the general structure of the ruliad implies that so long as the observers are “like us”, it’s inevitable that their perception of the universe will be that it follows things like general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>It’s very much like what happens with a gas of molecules: to an “observer like us” there are the same gas laws and the same laws of fluid dynamics essentially independent of the detailed structure of the individual molecules. </p>\n<p>So what does all this mean for mathematics? The crucial and at first surprising point is that the ideas we’re describing in physics can in effect immediately be carried over to mathematics. And the key is that the ruliad represents not only all physics, but also all mathematics—and it shows that these are not just related, but in some sense fundamentally the same.</p>\n<p>In the traditional formulation of axiomatic mathematics, one talks about deriving results from particular axiom systems—say <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--axioms-for-arithmetic/'>Peano Arithmetic</a>, or <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC set theory</a>, or the axioms of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>Euclidean geometry</a>. But the ruliad in effect represents the entangled consequences not just of specific axiom systems but of all possible axiom systems (as well as all possible laws of inference). </p>\n<p>But from this structure that in a sense corresponds to all possible mathematics, how do we pick out any particular mathematics that we’re interested in? The answer is that just as we are limited observers of the physical universe, so we are also limited observers of the “mathematical universe”. </p>\n<p>But what are we like as “mathematical observers”? As I’ll argue in more detail later, we inherit our core characteristics from those we exhibit as “physical observers”. And that means that when we “do mathematics” we’re effectively sampling the ruliad in much the same way as when we “do physics”. </p>\n<p>We can operate in different rulial reference frames, or at different locations in rulial space, and these will correspond to picking out different underlying “rules of mathematics”, or essentially using different axiom systems. But now we can make use of the correspondence with physics to say that we can also expect there to be certain “overall laws of mathematics” that are the result of general features of the ruliad as perceived by observers like us.</p>\n<p>And indeed we can expect that in some formal sense these overall laws will have exactly the same structure as those in physics—so that in effect in mathematics we’ll have something like the notion of space that we have in physics, as well as formal analogs of things like general relativity and quantum mechanics. </p>\n<p>What does this mean? It implies that—just as it’s possible to have coherent “higher-level descriptions” in physics that don’t just operate down at the level of atoms of space, so also this should be possible in mathematics. And this in a sense is why we can expect to consistently do what I described above as “human-level mathematics”, without usually having to drop down to the “molecular level” of specific axiomatic structures (or below).</p>\n<p>Say we’re talking about the Pythagorean theorem. Given some particular detailed axiom system for mathematics we can imagine using it to build up a precise—if potentially very long and pedantic—representation of the theorem. But let’s say we change some detail of our axioms, say associated with the way they talk about sets, or real numbers. We’ll almost certainly still be able to build up something we consider to be “the Pythagorean theorem”—even though the details of the representation will be different.</p>\n<p>In other words, this thing that we as humans would call “the Pythagorean theorem” is not just a single point in the ruliad, but a whole cloud of points. And now the question is: what happens if we try to derive other results from the Pythagorean theorem? It might be that each particular representation of the theorem—corresponding to each point in the cloud—would lead to quite different results. But it could also be that essentially the whole cloud would coherently lead to the same results.</p>\n<p>And the claim from the correspondence with physics is that there should be “general laws of mathematics” that apply to “observers like us” and that ensure that there’ll be coherence between all the different specific representations associated with the cloud that we identify as “the Pythagorean theorem”.</p>\n<p>In physics it could have been that we’d always have to separately say what happens to every atom of space. But we know that there’s a coherent higher-level description of space—in which for example we can just imagine that objects can move while somehow maintaining their identity. And we can now expect that it’s the same kind of thing in mathematics: that just as there’s a coherent notion of space in physics where things can for example move without being “shredded”, so also this will happen in mathematics. And this is why it’s possible to do “higher-level mathematics” without always dropping down to the lowest level of axiomatic derivations.</p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that even in physical space a concept like “pure motion” in which objects can move while maintaining their identity doesn’t always work. For example, close to a spacetime singularity, one can expect to eventually be forced to see through to the discrete structure of space—and for any “object” to inevitably be “shredded”. But most of the time it’s possible for observers like us to maintain the idea that there are coherent large-scale features whose behavior we can study using “bulk” laws of physics.</p>\n<p>And we can expect the same kind of thing to happen with mathematics. Later on, we’ll discuss more specific correspondences between phenomena in physics and mathematics—and we’ll see the effects of things like general relativity and quantum mechanics in mathematics, or, more precisely, in metamathematics. </p>\n<p>But for now, the key point is that we can think of mathematics as somehow being made of exactly the same stuff as physics: they’re both just features of the ruliad, as sampled by observers like us. And in what follows we’ll see the great power that arises from using this to combine the achievements and intuitions of physics and mathematics—and how this lets us think about new “general laws of mathematics”, and view the ultimate foundations of mathematics in a different light.</p>\n<h2 id='the-metamodeling-of-axiomatic-mathematics'><span>3 | </span>The Metamodeling of Axiomatic Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Consider all the mathematical statements that have appeared in mathematical books and papers. We can view these in some sense as the “observed phenomena” of (human) mathematics. And if we’re going to make a “general theory of mathematics” a first step is to do something like we’d typically do in natural science, and try to “drill down” to find a uniform underlying model—or at least representation—for all of them.</p>\n<p>At the outset, it might not be clear what sort of representation could possibly capture all those different mathematical statements. But what’s emerged over the past century or so—with particular clarity in <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a> and the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>—is that there is in fact a rather simple and general representation that works remarkably well: a representation in which everything is a symbolic expression. </p>\n<p>One can view a symbolic expression such as <tt>f[g[x][y, h[z]], w]</tt> as a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/33-expressions-and-their-structure.html'>hierarchical or tree structure</a>, in which at every level some particular “head” (like <tt>f</tt>) is “applied to” one or more arguments. Often in practice one deals with expressions in which the heads have “known meanings”—as in <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Times.html'>Times</a>[<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a>[2, 3], 4]</tt> in Wolfram Language. And with this kind of setup symbolic expressions are reminiscent of human natural language, with the heads basically corresponding to “known words” in the language. </p>\n<p>And presumably it’s this familiarity from human natural language that’s caused “human natural mathematics” to develop in a way that can so readily be represented by symbolic expressions. </p>\n<p>But in typical mathematics there’s an important wrinkle. One often wants to make statements not just about particular things but about whole classes of things. And it’s common to then just declare that some of the “symbols” (like, say, <em>x</em>) that appear in an expression are “variables”, while others (like, say, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a></tt>) are not. But in our effort to capture the essence of mathematics as uniformly as possible it seems much better to burn the idea of an object representing a whole class of things right into the structure of the symbolic expression. </p>\n<p><a name='pattern-expression'></a>And indeed this is a <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/32-patterns.html'>core idea in the Wolfram Language</a>, where something like <em>x</em> or <tt>f</tt> is just a “symbol that stands for itself”, while <em>x_</em> is a pattern (named <em>x</em>) that can stand for anything.

But what if we are given a statement, and asked whether it can be proved within the specified axiom system? In effect this asks whether if we make a sufficiently large multiway graph we can find a path of any length that corresponds to the statement.</p>\n<p>If our system was computationally reducible we could expect always to be able to find a finite answer to this question. But in general—with the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> and the ubiquitous presence of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a>—it’ll be common that there is no fundamentally better way to determine whether a path exists than effectively to try explicitly generating it. If we knew, for example, that the intermediate expressions generated always remained of bounded length, then this would still be a bounded problem.

For example, if one changes an expression at a particular step in the evolution of a multiway system, it can only affect a region of the branchial graph that essentially expands by one edge per step. </p>\n<p><a name='entailment-cone'></a>One can think of the affected region—in analogy with a light cone in spacetime—as being the “entailment cone” of a particular expression. The edge of the entailment cone in effect expands at a certain “maximum metamathematical speed” in metamathematical (i.e. branchial) space—which one can think of as being measured in units of “expression change per multiway step”.</p>\n<p>By analogy with physics one can start talking in general about motion in metamathematical space. A particular proof path in the multiway graph will progressively “move around” in the branchial graph that defines metamathematical space. (Yes, there are many subtle issues here, not least the fact that one has to imagine a certain kind of limit being taken so that the structure of the branchial graph is “stable enough” to “just be moving around” in something like a “fixed background space”.)</p>\n<p>By the way, the shortest proof path in the multiway graph is the analog of a geodesic in spacetime. And later we’ll talk about how the “density of activity” in the branchial graph is the analog of energy in physics, and how it can be seen as “deflecting” the path of geodesics, just as gravity does in spacetime.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning just one further subtlety. Branchial graphs are in effect associated with <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/foliations-of-the-multiway-graph-and-the-structure-of-branchial-space/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“transverse slices”</a> of the multiway graph—but there are many consistent ways to make these slices. In physics terms one can think of the foliations that define different choices of sequences of slices as being like “reference frames” in which one is specifying a sequence of “simultaneity surfaces” (here “branchtime hypersurfaces”). The particular branchial graphs we’ve shown here are ones associated with what in physics might be called the cosmological rest frame in which every node is the result of the same number of updates since the beginning.</p>\n<h2 id='the-issue-of-generated-variables'><span>6 | </span>The Issue of Generated Variables</h2>\n<p>A rule like</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img1A.png\" alt='' title='' width='172' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/07sw2019img1_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='1-07_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='1-07_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>defines transformations for any expressions <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img2A.png\" width= '18' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img3A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>.

Because then our final result was the expression <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img30A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> which can match <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img31A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> but not <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img32A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>—whereas now the final result is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img33A.png\" width= '49' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> which can match both <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img34A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img35A.png\" width= '29' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>This may seem like a subtle issue. But it’s critically important in practice. Not least because generated variables are in effect what make up all “truly new stuff” that can be produced. With a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img36A.png\" width= '165' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> one’s essentially just taking whatever one started with, and successively rearranging the pieces of it. But with a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/07sw2019img37A.png\" width= '163' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> there’s something “truly new” generated every time <em>z</em>_ appears. </p>\n<p>By the way, the basic issue of “generated variables” isn’t something specific to the particular symbolic expression setup we’ve been using here. For example, there’s a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-in-our-models/updating-events-and-causal-dependence/' target=_blank rel=noopener>direct analog of it in the hypergraph rewriting systems</a> that appear in our Physics Project. But in that case there’s a particularly clear interpretation: the analog of “generated variables” are new “atoms of space” produced by the application of rules. And far from being some kind of footnote, these “generated atoms of space” are what make up everything we have in our universe today. </p>\n<p>The issue of generated variables—and especially their naming—is the bane of all sorts of formalism for mathematical logic and programming languages. As we’ll see later, it’s perfectly possible to “go to a lower level” and set things up with no names at all, for example using <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>combinators</a>. But without names, things tend to seem quite alien to us humans—and certainly if we want to understand the correspondence with standard presentations of mathematics it’s pretty necessary to have names. So at least for now we’ll keep names, and handle the issue of generated variables by uniquifying their names, and canonicalizing every time we have a complete expression.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at another example to see the importance of how we handle generated variables.

But if everything is a symbolic expression there shouldn’t really need to be a distinction between “rules” and “ordinary expressions”. They’re all just expressions. And so we should as well be able to apply rules to rules as to ordinary expressions.</p>\n<p><a name='two-way-rule'></a>And indeed the concept of “applying rules to rules” is something that has a familiar analog in standard mathematics. The “two-way rules” we’ve been using effectively define equivalences—which are very common kinds of statements in mathematics, though in mathematics they’re usually written with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-equalA.png\" width= '13' height='23' align='absmiddle'></span> rather than with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/double-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width='20' height='22' align='absmiddle'></span>. And indeed, many axioms and many theorems are specified as equivalences—and in equational logic one takes everything to be defined using equivalences. And when one’s dealing with theorems (or axioms) specified as equivalences, the basic way one derives new theorems is by applying one theorem to another—or in effect by applying rules to rules.</p>\n<p>As a specific example, let’s say we have the “axiom”:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img3A.png\" alt='' title='' width='172' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img3_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='3-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='3-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We can now apply this to the rule</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img4A.png\" alt='' title='' width='106' height='24' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img4_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>to get (where since <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img5A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is equivalent to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img6A.png\" width= '47' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we’re sorting each two-way rule that arises)</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img7A.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='177' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img7_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='7-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='7-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>or after a few more steps:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy'src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img8A.png\" alt='' title='' width='552' height='312' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/08sw0223img8_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='8-08_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='8-08_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In this example all that’s happening is that the substitutions specified by the axiom are getting separately applied to the left- and right-hand sides of each rule that is generated.

But in an effort to maintain contact with standard mathematics we’ll for now have the “meta rule” that <em>x</em>_ can’t match an expression whose top-level operator is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/long-arrowA.png\" style='margin-bottom:4px' width='20' height='24' align='absmiddle'></span>. (As we’ll discuss later, including such matches would allow us to do exotic things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p815--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>encode set theory within arithmetic</a>, which is again something usually considered to be “syntactically prevented” in mathematical logic.)</p>\n<p>Another—still more obscure—meta rule we have is that <em>x</em>_ can’t “match inside a variable”. In Wolfram Language, for example, <em>a</em>_ has the full form <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Pattern.html'>Pattern</a>[a,<a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Blank.html'>Blank</a>[]]</tt>, and one could imagine that <em>x</em>_ could match “internal pieces” of this. But for now, we’re going to treat all variables as atomic—even though later on, when we “descend below the level of variables”, the story will be different. </p>\n<p>When we apply a rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img13A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/08sw0223img14A.png\" width= '87' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> we’re taking a rule with pattern variables, and doing substitutions with it on a “literal expression” without pattern variables. But it’s also perfectly possible to apply pattern rules to pattern rules<span style=\"font-size:14px\">&mdash;</span>and indeed that’s what we’ll mostly do below. But in this case there’s another subtle issue that can arise.

But when everything is a symbolic expression, it’s perfectly possible—as we saw above—to “treat code like data”, and in particular to generate rules as output. But this now raises a new possibility.

In any given proof we can in principle always just keep using the axioms over and over again—but it’ll be much more efficient to progressively build a library of more and more lemmas, and use these.

actually work in very different ways. The string rule can apply to characters anywhere within a string, but what it inserts is always of fixed size. The expression rule deals with trees, and only applies to “whole subtrees”, but what it inserts can be a tree of any size. (One can align these setups by thinking of strings as expressions in which characters are “bound together” by an associative operator, as in A·B·A·A. But if one explicitly gives associativity axioms these will lead to additional pieces in the token-event graph.)</p>\n<p>A rule like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/10sw0223img14A.png\" width= '97' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> also has the feature of involving patterns.

The proof is a subgraph of the “relevant part” of the full token-event graph. Often—in analogy to the simpler case of finding proofs of equivalences between expressions in a multiway graph—we’ll call this subgraph a “proof path”. </p>\n<p>But in addition to just “finding a proof” in a fully constructed token-event graph, we can ask whether, given a statement, we can directly construct a proof for it. As discussed in the context of proofs in ordinary multiway graphs, computational irreducibility implies that in general there’s no “shortcut” way to find a proof. In addition, for any statement, there may be no upper bound on the length of proof that will be required (or on the size or number of intermediate “lemmas” that will have to be used). And this, again, is the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p779--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>shadow of undecidability in our systems</a>: that there can be statements whose provability may be arbitrarily difficult to determine. </p>\n<h2 id='beyond-substitution-cosubstitution-and-bisubstitution'><span>12 | </span>Beyond Substitution: Cosubstitution and Bisubstitution</h2>\n<p>In making our “metamodel” of mathematics we’ve been discussing the rewriting of expressions according to rules. But there’s a subtle issue that we’ve so far avoided, that has to do with the fact that the expressions we’re rewriting are often themselves patterns that stand for whole classes of expressions. And this turns out to allow for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--substitution-strategies-in-proofs/'>additional kinds of transformations</a> that we’ll call cosubstitution and bisubstitution.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk first about cosubstitution. Imagine we have the expression <tt>f[a]</tt>. The rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img1A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> would do a substitution for <em>a</em> to give <tt>f[b]</tt>. But if we have the expression <tt>f[c]</tt> the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img2A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> will do nothing.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that we have the expression <tt>f[x_]</tt>. This stands for a whole class of expressions, including <tt>f[a]</tt>, <tt>f[c]</tt>, etc. For most of this class of expressions, the rule <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img3A.png\" width= '40' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> will do nothing. But in the specific case of <tt>f[a]</tt>, it applies, and gives the result <tt>f[b]</tt>.</p>\n<p>If our rule is <tt>f[x_]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> then this will apply as an ordinary substitution to <tt>f[a]</tt>, giving the result <em>s</em>. But if the rule is <tt>f[b]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> this will not apply as an ordinary substitution to <tt>f[a]</tt>. However, it can apply as a cosubstitution to <tt>f[x_]</tt> by picking out the specific case where <tt>x_</tt> stands for <em>b</em>, then using the rule to give <em>s</em>.</p>\n<p>In general, the point is that ordinary substitution specializes patterns that appear in rules—while what one can think of as the “dual operation” of cosubstitution specializes patterns that appear in the expressions to which the rules are being applied. If one thinks of the rule that’s being applied as like an operator, and the expression to which the rule is being applied as an operand, then in effect substitution is about making the operator fit the operand, and cosubstitution is about making the operand fit the operator.</p>\n<p>It’s important to realize that as soon as one’s operating on expressions involving patterns, cosubstitution is not something “optional”: it’s something that one has to include if one is really going to interpret patterns—wherever they occur—as standing for classes of expressions.</p>\n<p>When one’s operating on a literal expression (without patterns) only substitution is ever possible, as in</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img4A.png\" alt='' title='' width='201' height='27' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/13sw0223img4X_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='4X-13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='4X-13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>corresponding to this fragment of a token-event graph:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/13sw0223img5A.png\" alt='' title='' width='546' height='118' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/13sw0223img5X_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='5-13_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='5-13_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Let’s say we have the rule <tt>f[a]&nbsp;→&nbsp;s</tt> (where <tt>f[a]</tt> is a literal expression).

But typical strategies for automated theorem proving don’t naturally produce such graphs. In principle automated theorem proving could work by directly searching for a “path” that leads to the theorem one’s trying to prove. But usually it’s much easier instead to have as the “target” a simple tautology.</p>\n<p>At least conceptually automated theorem proving must still try to “navigate” through the full token-event graph that makes up the entailment cone. And the main issue in doing this is that there are many places where one does not know “which branch to take”. But here there’s a crucial—if at first surprising—fact: at least so long as one is using full bisubstitution it ultimately doesn’t matter which branch one takes; there’ll always be a way to “merge back” to any other branch.</p>\n<p>This is a consequence of the fact that the accumulative systems we’re using automatically have the property of confluence which says that every branch is accompanied by a subsequent merge. There’s an almost trivial way in which this is true by virtue of the fact that for every edge the system also includes the reverse of that edge. But there’s a more substantial reason as well: that given any two statements on two different branches, there’s always a way to combine them using a bisubstitution to get a single statement.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, the concept of <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-phenomenon-of-causal-invariance/' target=_blank rel=noopener>causal invariance</a>—which effectively generalizes confluence—is an important one, that leads among other things to ideas like relativistic invariance. Later on we’ll discuss the idea that “regardless of what order you prove theorems in, you’ll always get the same math”, and its relationship to causal invariance and to the notion of relativity in metamathematics. But for now the importance of confluence is that it has the potential to simplify automated theorem proving—because in effect it says one can never ultimately “make a wrong turn” in getting to a particular theorem, or, alternatively, that if one keeps going long enough every path one might take will eventually be able to reach every theorem. </p>\n<p>And indeed this is exactly how things work in the full entailment cone. But the challenge in automated theorem proving is to generate only a tiny part of the entailment cone, yet still “get to” the theorem we want. And in doing this we have to carefully choose which “branches” we should try to merge using bisubstitution events. In automated theorem proving these bisubstitution events are typically called “critical pair lemmas”, and there are a variety of strategies for defining an order in which critical pair lemmas should be tried. </p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that there’s absolutely no guarantee that such procedures will find the shortest proof of any given theorem (or in fact that they’ll find a proof at all with a given amount of computational effort). One can imagine “higher-order proofs” in which one attempts to transform not just statements of the form <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/15sw0224img24A.png\" width= '64' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, but full proofs (say represented as token-event graphs). And one can imagine <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04057.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>using such transformations to try to simplify proofs</a>. </p>\n<p>A general feature of the proofs we’ve been showing is that they are accumulative, in the sense they continually introduce lemmas which are then reused. But in principle any proof can be “unrolled” into one that just repeatedly uses the original axioms (and in fact, purely by substitution)—and never introduces other lemmas. The necessary “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--proof-structures/'>cut elimination</a>” can effectively be done by always recreating each lemma from the axioms whenever it’s needed—a process which can become exponentially complex.</p>\n<p>As an example, from the axiom above we can generate the proof</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/15sw0224img25A.png\" alt='' title='' width='484' height='464' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/15sw0224img25_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='25-15_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='25-15_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>where for example the first lemma at the top is reused in four events.

Yes, it can provide incontrovertible evidence that a theorem is valid. But that evidence is typically far away from being any kind of “narrative” suitable for human consumption. In the analogy to molecular dynamics, an automated proof gives detailed “turn-by-turn instructions” that show how a molecule can reach a certain place in a gas. Typical “human-style” mathematics, on the other hand, operates on a higher level, analogous to talking about overall motion in a fluid. And a core part of what&#8217;s achieved by our physicalization of metamathematics is understanding why it&#8217;s possible for mathematical observers like us to perceive mathematics as operating at this higher level.</p>\n<h2 id='axiom-systems-of-present-day-mathematics'><span>15 | </span>Axiom Systems of Present-Day Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The axiom systems we’ve been talking about so far were chosen largely for their axiomatic simplicity.

We can think of an axiom system as defining a collection of abstract constraints. But what can we say about objects that might satisfy those constraints? A model is in effect telling us about these objects. Or, put another way, it’s telling what “things” the axiom system “describes”.

Well, yes. They essentially correspond to (representations of) particular finite groups. The original axioms define constraints to be satisfied by any group. These models now correspond to particular groups with specific finite numbers of elements (and in fact specific representations of these groups). And just like in the Boolean algebra case this interpretation now allows us to start saying what the models are “about”. The first three, for example, correspond to cyclic groups which can be thought of as being “about” addition of integers mod <em>k</em>.</p>\n<p>For axiom systems that haven’t traditionally been studied in mathematics, there typically won’t be any such preexisting identification of what they’re “about”. But we can still think of models as being a way that a mathematical observer can characterize—or summarize—an axiom system. And in a sense we can see the collection of possible finite models for an axiom system as being a kind of “model signature” for the axiom system.</p>\n<p>But let’s now consider what models tell us about “theorems” associated with a given axiom system.

But for the non-valid models, different “patches” in the entailment cone are tagged with different codes. </p>\n<p>Let’s say we’re trying to see if two expressions are equal according to the underlying axiom system. The definitive way to tell this is to find a “proof path” from one expression to the other. But as an “approximation” we can just “evaluate” these two expressions according to a model, and see if the resulting codes are the same. Even if it’s a valid model, though, this can only definitively tell us that two expressions aren’t equal; it can’t confirm that they are. In principle we can refine things by checking in multiple models—particularly ones with more elements. But without essentially pre-checking all possible equalities we can’t in general be sure that this will give us the complete story.</p>\n<p>Of course, generating explicit proofs from the underlying axiom system can also be hard—because in general the proof can be arbitrarily long. And in a sense there is a tradeoff. Given a particular equivalence to check we can either search for a path in the entailment graph, often effectively having to try many possibilities. Or we can “do the work up front” by finding a model or collection of models that we know will correctly tell us whether the equivalence is correct.</p>\n<p>Later we’ll see how these choices relate to how mathematical observers can “parse” the structure of metamathematical space. In effect observers can either explicitly try to trace out “proof paths” formed from sequences of abstract symbolic expressions—or they can “globally predetermine” what expressions “mean” by identifying some overall model. In general there may be many possible choices of models—and what we’ll see is that these different choices are essentially analogous to different choices of reference frames in physics.</p>\n<p>One feature of our discussion of models so far is that we’ve always been talking about making models for axioms, and then applying these models to expressions. But in the accumulative systems we’ve discussed above (and that seem like closer metamodels of actual mathematics), we’re only ever talking about “statements”—with “axioms” just being statements we happen to start with.

Yes, one wants to know that a theorem has a proof (and perhaps the proof will be helpful in understanding the theorem), but the main focus is on theorems and not on proofs. In our effort to “go underneath” mathematics, however, we want to study not only what theorems there are, but also the process by which the theorems are reached. We can view it as an important simplifying assumption of typical mathematical observers that all that matters is theorems—and that different proofs aren’t relevant.

But in the middle it breaks into multiple disconnected components—in effect reflecting the emergence of multiple distinct regions of metamathematical space with something like event horizons temporarily existing between them.</p>\n<p>How should we interpret this? First and foremost, it’s something that reveals that there’s structure “below” the “fluid dynamics” level of mathematics; it’s something that depends on the discrete “axiomatic infrastructure” of metamathematics. And from the point of view of our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a>, we can think of it as a kind of metamathematical analog of a “<a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/basic-concepts-of-quantum-mechanics/' target=_blank rel=noopener>quantum effect</a>”.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine different paths in the multiway system to correspond to different possible quantum histories. The observer is in effect spread over multiple paths, which they coarse grain or conflate together. An “observable quantum effect” occurs when there are paths that can be followed by the system, but that are somehow “too far apart” to be immediately coarse-grained together by the observer. </p>\n<p>Put another way, there is “noticeable quantum interference” when the different paths corresponding to different histories that are “simultaneously happening” are “far enough apart” to be distinguished by the observer. “Destructive interference” is presumably associated with paths that are so far apart that to conflate them would effectively require conflating essentially every possible path. (And <a href='#the-notion-of-truth'>our later discussion</a> of the relationship between falsity and the “principle of explosion” then suggests a connection between destructive interference in physics and falsity in mathematics.) </p>\n<p>In essence what determines the extent of “quantum effects” is then our “size” as observers in branchial space relative to the size of features in branchial space such as the “topological holes” we’ve been discussing. In the metamathematical case, the “size” of us as observers is in effect related to our ability (or choice) to distinguish slight differences in axiomatic formulations of things. And what we’re saying here is that when there is nontrivial topology in proof space, there is an intrinsic dynamics in metamathematical entailment that leads to the development of distinctions at some scale—though whether these become “visible” to us as mathematical observers depends on how “strong a metamathematical microscope” we choose to use relative to the scale of the “topological holes”.</p>\n<h2 id='time-timelessness-and-entailment-fabrics'><span>19 | </span>Time, Timelessness and Entailment Fabrics</h2>\n<p>A fundamental feature of our metamodel of mathematics is the idea that a given set of mathematical statements can entail others. But in this picture what does “mathematical progress” look like?</p>\n<p>In analogy with physics one might imagine it would be like the evolution of the universe through time. One would start from some limited set of axioms and then—in a kind of “mathematical Big Bang”—these would lead to a progressively larger entailment cone containing more and more statements of mathematics. And in analogy with physics, one could imagine that the process of following chains of successive entailments in the entailment cone would correspond to the passage of time.</p>\n<p>But realistically this isn’t how most of the actual history of human mathematics has proceeded. Because people—and even their computers—basically never try to extend mathematics by axiomatically deriving all possible valid mathematical statements. Instead, they come up with particular mathematical statements that for one reason or another they think are valid and interesting, then try to prove these.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the proof may be difficult, and may involve a long chain of entailments. Occasionally—especially if automated theorem proving is used—the entailments may approximate a geodesic path all the way from the axioms. But the practical experience of human mathematics tends to be much more about identifying “nearby statements” and then trying to “fit them together” to deduce the statement one’s interested in.</p>\n<p>And in general human mathematics seems to progress not so much through the progressive “time evolution” of an entailment graph as through the assembly of what one might call an “entailment fabric” in which different statements are being knitted together by entailments.</p>\n<p>In physics, the analog of the entailment graph is basically the causal graph which builds up over time to define the content of a light cone (or, more accurately, an entanglement cone). The analog of the entailment fabric is basically the (more-or-less) instantaneous state of space (or, more accurately, branchial space). </p>\n<p>In our <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Physics Project</a> we typically take our lowest-level structure to be a hypergraph—and informally we often say that this <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>hypergraph “represents the structure of space”</a>. But really we should be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/#causal-balls-vs-geodesic-balls'>deducing the “structure of space”</a> by taking a particular time slice from the “dynamic evolution” represented by the causal graph—and for example we should think of two “atoms of space” as “being connected” in the “instantaneous state of space” if there’s a causal connection between them defined within the slice of the causal graph that occurs within the time slice we’re considering. In other words, the “structure of space” is knitted together by the causal connections represented by the causal graph. (In traditional physics, we might say that space can be “mapped out” by looking at overlaps between lots of little light cones.)</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how this works out in our metamathematical setting, using string rewrites to simplify things.

Yes, this structure can in principle be viewed as part of the branchial graph obtained from a slice of an entailment graph (and technically this will be a useful way to think about it). But a different view—closer to the practice of human mathematics—is that it’s a “fabric” formed by fitting together many different mathematical statements. It’s not something where one’s tracking the overall passage of time, and seeing causal connections between things—as one might in “running a program”. Rather, it’s something where one’s fitting pieces together in order to satisfy <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p210--systems-based-on-constraints/'>constraints—as one might in creating a tiling</a>.</p>\n<p>Underneath everything is <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. And entailment cones and entailment fabrics can be thought of just as different samplings or slicings of the ruliad. The ruliad is ultimately the entangled limit of all possible computations. But one can think of it as being built up by starting from all possible rules and initial conditions, then running them for an infinite number of steps. An entailment cone is essentially a “slice” of this structure where one’s looking at the “time evolution” from a particular rule and initial condition. An entailment fabric is an “orthogonal” slice, looking “at a particular time” across different rules and initial conditions. (And, by the way, rules and initial conditions are essentially equivalent, particularly in an accumulative system.)</p>\n<p>One can think of these different slices of the ruliad as being what different kinds of observers will perceive within the ruliad. Entailment cones are essentially what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>observers who persist through time</a> but are localized in rulial space will perceive. Entailment fabrics are what observers who ignore time but explore more of rulial space will perceive. </p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>Elsewhere I’ve argued</a> that a crucial part of what makes us perceive the laws of physics we do is that we are observers who consider ourselves to be persistent through time. But now we’re seeing that in the way human mathematics is typically done, the “mathematical observer” will be of a different character. And whereas for a physical observer what’s crucial is causality through time, for a mathematical observer (at least one who’s doing mathematics the way it’s usually done) what seems to be crucial is some kind of consistency or coherence across metamathematical space. </p>\n<p>In physics it’s far from obvious that a persistent observer would be possible. It could be that with all those detailed computationally irreducible processes happening down at the level of atoms of space there might be nothing in the universe that one could consider consistent through time. But the point is that there are certain “coarse-grained” attributes of the behavior that are consistent through time. And it is by concentrating on these that we end up describing things in terms of the laws of physics we know.</p>\n<p>There’s something very analogous going on in mathematics. The detailed branchial structure of metamathematical space is complicated, and presumably full of computational irreducibility. But once again there are “coarse-grained” attributes that have a certain consistency and coherence across it. And it is on these that we concentrate as human “mathematical observers”. And it is in terms of these that we end up being able to do “human-level mathematics”—in effect operating at a “fluid dynamics” level rather than a “molecular dynamics” one. </p>\n<p>The possibility of “doing physics in the ruliad” depends crucially on the fact that as physical observers we assume that we have certain persistence and coherence through time. The possibility of “doing mathematics (the way it’s usually done) in the ruliad” depends crucially on the fact that as “mathematical observers” we assume that the mathematical statements we consider will have a certain coherence and consistency—or, in effect, that it’s possible for us to maintain and grow a coherent body of mathematical knowledge, even as we try to include all sorts of new mathematical statements. </p>\n<h2 id='the-notion-of-truth'><span>20 | </span>The Notion of Truth</h2>\n<p>Logic was originally conceived as a way to characterize human arguments—in which the concept of “truth” has always seemed quite central. And when logic was applied to the foundations of mathematics, “truth” was also usually assumed to be quite central. But the way we’ve modeled mathematics here has been much more about what statements can be derived (or entailed) than about any kind of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--truth-and-falsity-in-formal-systems/'>abstract notion of what statements can be “tagged as true”</a>. In other words, we’ve been more concerned with “structurally deriving” that “<span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img1A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>” than in saying that “1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is true”.</p>\n<p>But what is the relation between this kind of “constructive derivation” and the logical notion of truth? We might just say that “if we can construct a statement then we should consider it true”. And if we’re starting from axioms, then in a sense we’ll never have an “absolute notion of truth”—because whatever we derive is only “as true as the axioms we started from”. </p>\n<p>One issue that can come up is that our axioms might be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p781--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>inconsistent</a>—in the sense that from them we can derive two obviously inconsistent statements. But to get further in discussing things like this we really need not only to have a notion of truth, but also a notion of falsity.</p>\n<p>In traditional logic it has tended to be assumed that truth and falsity are very much “the same kind of thing”—like 1 and 0. But one feature of our view of mathematics here is that actually truth and falsity seem to have a rather different character. And perhaps this is not surprising—because in a sense if there’s one true statement about something there are typically an infinite number of false statements about it. So, for example, the single statement <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img3A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> is true, but the infinite collection of statements <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img4A.png\" width= '59' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> for any other <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img5A.png\" width= '9' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> are all false. </p>\n<p>There is another aspect to this, discussed since at least the Middle Ages, often under the name of the “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion' target=_blank rel=noopener>principle of explosion</a>”: that as soon as one assumes any statement that is false, one can logically derive absolutely any statement at all. In other words, introducing a single “false axiom” will start an explosion that will eventually “blow up everything”.</p>\n<p>So within our model of mathematics we might say that things are “true” if they can be derived, and are “false” if they lead to an “explosion”. But let’s say we’re given some statement. How can we tell if it’s true or false? One thing we can do to find out if it’s true is to construct an entailment cone from our axioms and see if the statement appears anywhere in it. Of course, given computational irreducibility there’s in general no upper bound on how far we’ll need to go to determine this. But now to find out if a statement is false we can imagine introducing the statement as an additional axiom, and then seeing if the entailment cone that’s now produced contains an explosion—though once again there’ll in general be no upper bound on how far we’ll have to go to guarantee that we have a “genuine explosion” on our hands.</p>\n<p>So is there any alternative procedure? Potentially the answer is yes: we can just try to see if our statement is somehow equivalent to “true” or “false”. But in our model of mathematics where we’re just talking about transformations on symbolic expressions, there’s no immediate built-in notion of “true” and “false”. To talk about these we have to add something. And for example what we can do is to say that “true” is equivalent to what seems like an “obvious tautology” such as <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img6A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, or in our computational notation, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img7A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, while “false” is equivalent to something “obviously explosive”, like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img8A.png\" width= '65' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> (or in our particular setup something more like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img9A.png\" width= '101' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>). </p>\n<p>But even though something like “Can we find a way to reach <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img10A.png\" width= '65' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> from a given statement?” seems like a much more practical question for an actual theorem-proving system than “Can we fish our statement out of a whole entailment cone?”, it runs into many of the same issues—in particular that there’s no upper limit on the length of path that might be needed.</p>\n<p>Soon we’ll return to the question of how all this relates to our interpretation of mathematics as a slice of the ruliad—and to the concept of the entailment fabric perceived by a mathematical observer. But to further set the context for what we’re doing let’s explore how what we’ve discussed so far relates to things like <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--godels-theorem/'>Gödel’s theorem</a>, and to phenomena like incompleteness. </p>\n<p>From the setup of basic logic we might assume that we could consider any statement to be either true or false. Or, more precisely, we might think that given a particular axiom system, we should be able to determine whether any statement that can be syntactically constructed with the primitives of that axiom system is true or false. We could explore this by asking whether every statement is either derivable or leads to an explosion—or can be proved equivalent to an “obvious tautology” or to an “obvious explosion”. </p>\n<p>But as a simple “approximation” to this, let’s consider a string rewriting system in which we define a “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p780--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>local negation operation</a>”. In particular, let’s assume that given a statement like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img11A.png\" width= '82' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> the “negation” of this statement just exchanges A and B, in this case yielding <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img12A.png\" width= '83' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s ask what statements are generated from a given axiom system. Say we start with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img13A.png\" width= '60' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>.

But now let’s “negate” the statements, by exchanging A and B. And if we do this, we’ll see that there’s never a statement where both it and its negation occur. In other words, there’s no obvious inconsistency being generated within this axiom system.</p>\n<p>But if we consider instead the axiom <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img16A.png\" width= '72' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> then this gives:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img17A.png\" alt='' title='' width='564' height='19' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/22sw0227img17Z_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='17-22_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='17-22_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And since this includes both <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img18A.png\" width= '71' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and its “negation” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22sw0227img19A.png\" width= '73' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>, by our criteria we must consider this axiom system to be inconsistent. </p>\n<p>In addition to inconsistency, we can also ask about incompleteness. For all possible statements, does the axiom system eventually generate either the statement or its negation? Or, in other words, can we always decide from the axiom system whether any given statement is true or false?</p>\n<p>With our simple assumption about negation, questions of inconsistency and incompleteness become at least in principle very simple to explore. Starting from a given axiom system, we generate its entailment cone, then we ask within this cone what fraction of possible statements, say of a given length, occur.</p>\n<p>If the answer is more than 50% we know there’s inconsistency, while if the answer is less than 50% that’s evidence of incompleteness. So what happens with different possible axiom systems?</p>\n<p>Here are some <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>results from <em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>, in each case showing both what amounts to the raw entailment cone (or, in this case, multiway system evolution from “true”), and the number of statements of a given length reached after progressively more steps:</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p798--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/22-nks-p798-implications-for-mathematics-2A.png' alt='Page 798' title='Page 798' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>\n<p>At some level this is all rather straightforward. But from the pictures above we can already get a sense that there’s a problem. For most axiom systems the fraction of statements reached of a given length changes as we increase the number of steps in the entailment cone. Sometimes it’s straightforward to see what fraction will be achieved even after an infinite number of steps. But often it’s not.</p>\n<p>And in general we’ll run into computational irreducibility—so that in effect the only way to determine whether some particular statement is generated is just to go to ever more steps in the entailment cone and see what happens. In other words, there’s no guaranteed-finite way to decide what the ultimate fraction will be—and thus whether or not any given axiom system is inconsistent, or incomplete, or neither.</p>\n<p>For some axiom systems it may be possible to tell. But for some axiom systems it’s not, in effect because we don’t in general know how far we’ll have to go to determine whether a given statement is true or not. </p>\n<p>A certain amount of additional technical detail is required to reach the standard versions of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. (Note that these theorems were originally stated specifically for the Peano axioms for arithmetic, but the Principle of Computational Equivalence suggests that they’re in some sense much more general, and even ubiquitous.) But the important point here is that given an axiom system there may be statements that either can or cannot be reached—but there’s no upper bound on the length of path that might be needed to reach them even if one can.</p>\n<p>OK, so let’s come back to talking about the notion of truth in the context of the ruliad. We’ve discussed axiom systems that might show inconsistency, or incompleteness—and the difficulty of determining if they do. But the ruliad in a sense contains all possible axiom systems—and generates all possible statements.</p>\n<p>So how then can we ever expect to identify which statements are “true” and which are not? When we talked about particular axiom systems, we said that any statement that is generated can be considered true (at least with respect to that axiom system). But in the ruliad every statement is generated. So what criterion can we use to determine which we should consider “true”?</p>\n<p>The key idea is any computationally bounded observer (like us) can perceive only a tiny slice of the ruliad. And it’s a perfectly meaningful question to ask whether a particular statement occurs within that perceived slice.</p>\n<p>One way of picking a “slice” is just to start from a given axiom system, and develop its entailment cone. And with such a slice, the criterion for the truth of a statement is exactly what we discussed above: does the statement occur in the entailment cone?</p>\n<p>But how do typical “mathematical observers” actually sample the ruliad? As we discussed in the previous section, it seems to be much more by forming an entailment fabric than by developing a whole entailment cone. And in a sense progress in mathematics can be seen as a process of adding pieces to an entailment fabric: pulling in one mathematical statement after another, and checking that they fit into the fabric.</p>\n<p>So what happens if one tries to add a statement that “isn’t true”? The basic answer is that it produces an “explosion” in which the entailment fabric can grow to encompass essentially any statement. From the point of view of underlying rules—or the ruliad—there’s really nothing wrong with this. But the issue is that it’s incompatible with an “observer like us”—or with any realistic idealization of a mathematician. </p>\n<p>Our view of a mathematical observer is essentially an entity that accumulates mathematical statements into an entailment fabric. But we assume that the observer is computationally bounded, so in a sense they can only work with a limited collection of statements. So if there’s an explosion in an entailment fabric that means the fabric will expand beyond what a mathematical observer can coherently handle. Or, put another way, the only kind of entailment fabrics that a mathematical observer can reasonably consider are ones that “contain no explosions”. And in such fabrics, it’s reasonable to take the generation or entailment of a statement as a signal that the statement can be considered true.</p>\n<p>The ruliad is in a sense a unique and absolute thing. And we might have imagined that it would lead us to a unique and absolute definition of truth in mathematics. But what we’ve seen is that that’s not the case. And instead our notion of truth is something based on how we sample the ruliad as mathematical observers. But now we must explore what this means about what mathematics as we perceive it can be like.</p>\n<h2 id='what-can-human-mathematics-be-like'><span>21 | </span>What Can Human Mathematics Be Like?</h2>\n<p>The ruliad in a sense contains all structurally possible mathematics—including all mathematical statements, all axiom systems and everything that follows from them. But mathematics as we humans conceive of it is never the whole ruliad; instead it is always just some tiny part that we as mathematical observers sample.</p>\n<p>We might imagine, however, that this would mean that there is in a sense a complete arbitrariness to our mathematics—because in a sense we could just pick any part of the ruliad we want. Yes, we might want to start from a specific axiom system. But we might imagine that that axiom system could be chosen arbitrarily, with no further constraint. And that the mathematics we study can therefore be thought of as an essentially arbitrary choice, determined by its detailed history, and perhaps by cognitive or other features of humans.</p>\n<p>But there is a crucial additional issue. When we “sample our mathematics” from the ruliad we do it as mathematical observers and ultimately as humans. And it turns out that even very general features of us as mathematical observers turn out to put strong constraints on what we can sample, and how.</p>\n<p><a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>When we discussed physics</a>, we said that the central features of observers are their computational boundedness and their assumption of their own persistence through time. In mathematics, observers are again computationally bounded. But now it is not persistence through time that they assume, but rather a certain coherence of accumulated knowledge. </p>\n<p>We can think of a mathematical observer as progressively expanding the entailment fabric that they consider to “represent mathematics”. And the question is what they can add to that entailment fabric while still “remaining coherent” as observers. In the previous section, for example, we argued that if the observer adds a statement that can be considered “logically false” then this will lead to an “explosion” in the entailment fabric. </p>\n<p>Such a statement is certainly present in the ruliad. But if the observer were to add it, then they wouldn’t be able to maintain their coherence—because, whimsically put, their mind would necessarily explode. </p>\n<p>In thinking about axiomatic mathematics it’s been standard to say that any axiom system that’s “reasonable to use” should at least be consistent (even though, yes, for a given axiom system it’s in <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--consistency-in-axiom-systems/'>general ultimately undecidable</a> whether this is the case). And certainly consistency is one criterion that we now see is necessary for a “mathematical observer like us”. But one can expect that it’s not the only criterion.</p>\n<p>In other words, although it’s perfectly possible to write down any axiom system, and even start generating its entailment cone, only some axiom systems may be compatible with “mathematical observers like us”. </p>\n<p>And so, for example, something like the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-4--continuum-and-cardinality/'>Continuum Hypothesis</a>—which is known to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>independent of the “established axioms” of set theory</a>—may well have the feature that, say, it has to be assumed to be true in order to get a metamathematical structure compatible with mathematical observers like us.</p>\n<p>In the case of physics, we know that the general characteristics of observers lead to certain key perceived features and laws of physics. In statistical mechanics, we’re dealing with “coarse-grained observers” who don’t trace and decode the paths of individual molecules, and therefore perceive the Second Law of thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, etc. And in our Physics Project we’re also dealing with coarse-grained observers who don’t track all the details of the atoms of space, but instead perceive space as something coherent and effectively continuous. </p>\n<p>And it seems as if in metamathematics there’s something very similar going on. As we began to discuss in the <a href='#mathematics-and-physics-have-the-same-foundations'>very first section above</a>, mathematical observers tend to “coarse grain” metamathematical space. In operational terms, one way they do this is by talking about something like the Pythagorean theorem without always going down to the detailed level of axioms, and for example saying just how real numbers should be defined. And something related is that they tend to concentrate more on mathematical statements and theorems than on their proofs. <a href='#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>Later we&#8217;ll see</a> how in the context of the ruliad there’s an even deeper level to which one can go. But the point here is that in actually doing mathematics one tends to operate at the “human scale” of talking about mathematical concepts rather than the “molecular-scale details” of axioms.</p>\n<p>But why does this work? Why is one not continually “dragged down” to the detailed axiomatic level—or below? How come it’s possible to reason at what we described above as the “fluid dynamics” level, without always having to go down to the detailed “molecular dynamics” level?</p>\n<p>The basic claim is that this works for mathematical observers for essentially the same reason as the perception of space works for physical observers. With the “coarse-graining” characteristics of the observer, it’s inevitable that the slice of the ruliad they sample will have the kind of coherence that allows them to operate at a higher level. In other words, mathematics can be done “at a human level” for the same basic reason that we have a “human-level experience” of space in physics.</p>\n<p>The fact that it works this way depends both on necessary features of the ruliad—<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>and in general of multicomputation</a>—as well as on characteristics of us as observers. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, there are “corner cases” where what we’ve described starts to break down. In physics, for example, the “human-level experience” of space breaks down near <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>spacetime singularities</a>. And in mathematics, there are cases where for example <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p789--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>undecidability forces one to take a lower-level</a>, more axiomatic and ultimately more metamathematical view. </p>\n<p>But the point is that there are large regions of physical space—and metamathematical space—where these kinds of issues don’t come up, and where our assumptions about physical—and mathematical—observers can be maintained. And this is what ultimately allows us to have the “human-scale” views of physics and mathematics that we do.</p>\n<h2 id='going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'><span>22 | </span>Going below Axiomatic Mathematics</h2>\n<p>In the traditional view of the foundations of mathematics one imagines that axioms—say stated in terms of symbolic expressions—are in some sense the lowest level of mathematics. But thinking in terms of the ruliad suggests that in fact there is a still-lower “ur level”—a kind of analog of machine code in which everything, including axioms, is broken down into ultimate “raw computation”.</p>\n<p>Take an axiom like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img1A.png\" width= '105' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>, or, in more precise computational language:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img2A.png\" alt='' title='' width='140' height='21' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/24sw0228img2_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='2-24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='2-24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Compared to everything we’re used to seeing in mathematics this looks simple. But actually it’s already got a lot in it. For example, it assumes the notion of a binary operator, which it’s in effect naming “∘”. And for example it also assumes the notion of variables, and has two distinct pattern variables that are in effect “tagged” with the names <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. </p>\n<p>So how can we define what this axiom ultimately “means”? Somehow we have to go from its essentially textual symbolic representation to a piece of actual computation. And, yes, the particular representation we’ve used here can immediately be interpreted as computation in the <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/'>Wolfram Language</a>. But the ultimate computational concept we’re dealing with is more general than that. And in particular it can exist in any <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p642--the-phenomenon-of-universality/'>universal computational system</a>.</p>\n<p>Different universal computational systems (say particular languages or CPUs or Turing machines) may have different ways to represent computations. But ultimately any computation can be represented in any of them—with the differences in representation being like different “coordinatizations of computation”.</p>\n<p>And however we represent computations there is one thing we can say for sure: all possible computations are somewhere in the ruliad. Different representations of computations correspond in effect to different coordinatizations of the ruliad. But all computations are ultimately there.</p>\n<p>For our Physics Project it’s been convenient use a “parametrization of computation” that can be thought of as being based on rewriting of hypergraphs. The elements in these hypergraphs are ultimately purely abstract, but we tend to talk about them as “atoms of space” to indicate the beginnings of our interpretation.</p>\n<p><a name='expression-rewriting'></a>It’s perfectly possible to use hypergraph rewriting as the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/equivalence-and-computation-in-our-models/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“substrate” for representing axiom systems stated in terms of symbolic expressions</a>. But it’s a bit more convenient (though ultimately equivalent) to instead use systems based on expression rewriting—or in effect tree rewriting.</p>\n<p>At the outset, one might imagine that different axiom systems would somehow have to be represented by “different rules” in the ruliad. But as one might expect from the phenomenon of universal computation, it’s actually perfectly possible to think of different axiom systems as just being specified by different “data” operated on by a single set of rules. There are many rules and structures that we could use. But one set that has the benefit of a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-and-the-story-of-computation/'>century of history</a> are <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>S, K combinators</a>.</p>\n<p>The basic concept is to represent everything in terms of “combinator expressions” containing just the two objects S and K. (It’s also possible to have just one fundamental object, and indeed <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/06/1920-2020-and-a-20000-prize-announcing-the-s-combinator-challenge/'>S alone may be enough</a>.)</p>\n<p>It’s worth saying at the outset that when we go this “far down” things get pretty non-human and obscure. Setting things up in terms of axioms may already seem pedantic and low level. But going to a substrate below axioms—that we can think of as getting us to raw “atoms of existence”—will lead us to a whole other level of obscurity and complexity.

Basically what we’re seeing is that in the “raw machine code” of S, K combinators it’s possible to “find” a representation for something we consider to be a piece of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Earlier we talked about starting from structures like axiom systems and then “compiling them down” to raw machine code. But what about just “finding mathematics” in a sense “naturally occurring” in “raw machine code”? We can think of the ruliad as containing “all possible machine code”. And somewhere in that machine code must be all the conceivable “structures of mathematics”. But the question is: in the wildness of the raw ruliad, what structures can we as mathematical observers successfully pick out? </p>\n<p>The situation is quite directly analogous to what happens at multiple levels in physics. Consider for example a fluid full of molecules bouncing around. As we’ve discussed several times, observers like us usually aren’t sensitive to the detailed dynamics of the molecules. But we can still successfully pick out large-scale structures—like overall fluid motions, vortices, etc. And—much like in mathematics—we can talk about physics just at this higher level. </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project all this becomes much more extreme. For example, we imagine that space and everything in it is just a giant network of atoms of space. And now within this network we imagine that there are “repeated patterns”—that correspond to things like electrons and quarks and black holes. </p>\n<p>In a sense it is the big achievement of natural science to have managed to find these regularities so that we can describe things in terms of them, without always having to go down to the level of atoms of space. But the fact that these are the kinds of regularities we have found is also a statement about us as physical observers.</p>\n<p>And the point is that even at the level of the raw ruliad our characteristics as physical observers will inevitably lead us to such regularities. The fact that we are computationally bounded and assume ourselves to have a certain persistence will lead us to consider things that are localized and persistent—that in physics we <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/elementary-particles/' target=_blank rel=noopener>identify for example as particles</a>.</p>\n<p>And it’s very much the same thing in mathematics. As mathematical observers we’re interested in picking out from the raw ruliad “repeated patterns” that are somehow robust. But now instead of identifying them as particles, we’ll identify them as mathematical constructs and definitions. In other words, just as a repeated pattern in the ruliad might in physics be interpreted as an electron, in mathematics a repeated pattern in the ruliad might be interpreted as an integer. </p>\n<p>We might think of physics as something “emergent” from the structure of the ruliad, and now we’re thinking of mathematics the same way. And of course not only is the “underlying stuff” of the ruliad the same in both cases, but also in both cases it’s “observers like us” that are sampling and perceiving things.</p>\n<p>There are lots of analogies to the process we’re describing of “fishing constructs out of the raw ruliad”. As one example, consider the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p229--the-emergence-of-order/'>evolution of a (“class 4”) cellular automaton</a> in which <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p292--structures-in-class-4-systems/'>localized structures</a> emerge:</p>\n<table class='InCell'>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan='1' rowspan='1' class='Input'>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class='' style='margin-left:5px' loading='lazy' src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/24sw0228img26A.png\" alt='' title='' width='579' height='356' />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class='IFL' data-src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/02/24sw0228img26_copy.txt\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='close' id='26-24_out'>&amp;#10005</span></p>\n<pre class='text' id='26-24_out_text'></pre>\n</p></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Underneath, just as throughout the ruliad, there’s lots of detailed computation going on, with rules repeatedly getting applied to each cell. But out of all this underlying computation we can identify a certain set of persistent structures—which we can use to make a “higher-level description” that may capture the aspects of the behavior that we care about. </p>\n<p>Given an “ocean” of S, K combinator expressions, how might we set about “finding mathematics” in them? One straightforward approach is just to identify certain “mathematical properties” we want, and then go searching for S, K combinator expressions that satisfy these.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want to “search for (propositional) logic” we first need to pick combinator expressions to symbolically represent “true” and “false”. There are many pairs of expressions that will work.

Obviously any combinator expression does what it does at the level of raw combinators. But the question is whether it can be given a “higher-level”—and potentially “mathematical”—interpretation.</p>\n<p>And in a sense this is directly an issue of what a mathematical observer “perceives” in it. Does it contain some kind of robust structure—say a kind of analog for mathematics of a particle in physics? </p>\n<p>Axiom systems can be viewed as a particular way to “summarize” certain “raw machine code” in the ruliad. But from the point of a “raw coordinatization of the ruliad” like combinators there doesn’t seem to be anything immediately special about them. At least for us humans, however, they do seem to be an obvious “waypoint”. Because by distinguishing operators and variables, establishing arities for operators and introducing names for things, they reflect the kind of structure that’s familiar from human language.</p>\n<p>But now that we think of the ruliad as what’s “underneath” both mathematics and physics there’s a different path that’s suggested. With the axiomatic approach we’re effectively trying to leverage human language as a way of summarizing what’s going on. But an alternative is to leverage our direct experience of the physical world, and our perception and intuition about things like space. And as we’ll discuss later, this is likely in many ways a better “metamodel” of the way pure mathematics is actually practiced by us humans.</p>\n<p>In some sense, this goes straight from the “raw machine code” of the ruliad to “human-level mathematics”, sidestepping the axiomatic level. But given how much “reductionist” work has already been done in mathematics to represent its results in axiomatic form, there is definitely still great value in seeing how the whole axiomatic setup can be “fished out” of the “raw ruliad”.</p>\n<p>And there’s certainly no lack of complicated technical issues in doing this. As one example, how should one deal with “generated variables”? If one “coordinatizes” the ruliad in terms of something like hypergraph rewriting this is fairly straightforward: it just involves creating new elements or hypergraph nodes (which in physics would be interpreted as atoms of space). But for something like S, K combinators it’s a bit more subtle. In the examples we’ve given above, we have combinators that, when “run”, eventually reach a fixed point. But to deal with generated variables we probably also need combinators <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#combinators-in-the-wild-some-zoology'>that never reach fixed points</a>, making it considerably more complicated to identify correspondences with definite symbolic expressions.</p>\n<p>Another issue involves rules of entailment, or, in effect, the metalogic of an axiom system. In the full axiomatic setup we want to do things like create <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/#the-formal-structure-of-multicomputation'>token-event graphs</a>, where each event corresponds to an entailment. But what rule of entailment should be used? The underlying rules for S, K combinators, for example, define a particular choice—though they can be used to emulate others. But the ruliad in a sense contains all choices. And, once again, it’s up to the observer to “fish out” of the raw ruliad a particular “slice”—which captures not only the axiom system but also the rules of entailment used.</p>\n<p>It may be worth mentioning a slightly different existing “reductionist” approach to mathematics: the idea of describing things in terms of <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Typed.html'>types</a>. A type is in effect an equivalence class that characterizes, say, all integers, or all functions from tuples of reals to truth values. But in our terms we can interpret a type as a kind of “template” for our underlying “machine code”: we can say that some piece of machine code represents something of a particular type if the machine code matches a particular pattern of some kind. And the issue is then whether that pattern is somehow robust “like a particle” in the raw ruliad.</p>\n<p>An important part of what made our Physics Project possible is the idea of going “underneath” space and time and other traditional concepts of physics. And in a sense what we’re doing here is something very similar, though for mathematics. We want to go “underneath” concepts like functions and variables, and even the very idea of symbolic expressions. In our Physics Project a convenient “parametrization” of what’s “underneath” is a hypergraph made up of elements that we often refer to as “atoms of space”. In mathematics we’ve discussed using combinators as our “parametrization” of what’s “underneath”.</p>\n<p>But what are these “made of”? We can think of them as corresponding to raw elements of metamathematics, or raw elements of computation. But in the end, they’re “made of” whatever the ruliad is “made of”. And perhaps the best description of the elements of the ruliad is that they are “atoms of existence”—the smallest units of anything, from which everything, in mathematics and physics and elsewhere, must be made. </p>\n<p><a name='eme'></a>The atoms of existence aren’t bits or points or anything like that. They’re something fundamentally lower level that’s come into focus only with our Physics Project, and particularly with the identification of the ruliad. And for our purposes here I’ll call such atoms of existence “emes” (pronounced “eemes”, like phonemes etc.). </p>\n<p>Everything in the ruliad is made of emes. The atoms of space in our Physics Project are emes. The nodes in our combinator trees are emes. An eme is a deeply abstract thing. And in a sense all it has is an identity. Every eme is distinct. We could give it a name if we wanted to, but it doesn’t intrinsically have one. And in the end the structure of everything is built up simply from relations between emes. </p>\n<h2 id='the-physicalized-laws-of-mathematics'><span>23 | </span>The Physicalized Laws of Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The concept of the ruliad suggests there is a deep connection between the foundations of mathematics and physics. And now that we have discussed how some of the familiar formalism of mathematics can “fit into” the ruliad, we are ready to use the “bridge” provided by the ruliad to start exploring how to apply some of the successes and intuitions of physics to mathematics.</p>\n<p>A foundational part of our everyday experience of physics is our perception that we live in continuous space. But our Physics Project implies that at sufficiently small scales <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space'>space is actually made of discrete elements</a>—and it is only because of the coarse-grained way in which we experience it that we perceive it as continuous.</p>\n<p>In mathematics—unlike physics—we’ve long thought of the foundations as being based on things like symbolic expressions that have a fundamentally discrete structure. Normally, though, the elements of those expressions are, for example, given human-recognizable names (like 2 or <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plus.html'>Plus</a></tt>). But what we saw in the previous section is that these recognizable forms can be thought of as existing in an “anonymous” lower-level substrate made of what we can call atoms of existence or emes.</p>\n<p>But the crucial point is that this substrate is directly based on the ruliad. And its structure is identical between the foundations of mathematics and physics. In mathematics the emes aggregate up to give us our universe of mathematical statements. In physics they aggregate up to give us our physical universe.</p>\n<p>But now the commonality of underlying “substrate” makes us realize that we should be able to take our experience of physics, and apply it to mathematics. So what is the analog in mathematics of our perception of the continuity of space in physics? We’ve discussed the idea that we can think of mathematical statements as being laid out in a metamathematical space—or, more specifically, in what we’ve called an <a href='#time-timelessness-and-entailment-fabrics'>entailment fabric</a>. We initially talked about “coordinatizing” this using axioms, but in the previous section we saw how to go “below axioms” to the level of “pure emes”. </p>\n<p>When we do mathematics, though, we’re sampling this on a much higher level. And just like as physical observers we coarse grain the emes (that we usually call “atoms of space”) that make up physical space, so too as “mathematical observers” we coarse grain the emes that make up metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>Foundational approaches to mathematics—particularly over the past century or so—have almost always been based on axioms and on their fundamentally discrete symbolic structure. But by going to a lower level and seeing the correspondence with physics we are led to consider what we might think of as a higher-level “experience” of mathematics—operating not at the “molecular dynamics” level of specific axioms and entailments, but rather at what one might call the “fluid dynamics” level of larger-scale concepts.</p>\n<p>At the outset one might not have any reason to think that this higher-level approach could consistently be applied. But this is the first big place where ideas from physics can be used. If both physics and mathematics are based on the ruliad, and if our general characteristics as observers apply in both physics and mathematics, then we can expect that similar features will emerge. And in particular, we can expect that our everyday perception of physical space as continuous will carry over to mathematics, or, more accurately, to metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>The picture is that we as mathematical observers have a certain <a href='#counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'>“size” in metamathematical space</a>. We identify concepts—like integers or the Pythagorean theorem—as “regions” in the space of possible configurations of emes (and ultimately of slices of the ruliad). At an axiomatic level we might think of ways to capture what a typical mathematician might consider “the same concept” with slightly different formalism (say, different large cardinal axioms or different models of real numbers). But when we get down to the level of emes there’ll be vastly more freedom in how we capture a given concept—so that we’re in effect using a whole region of “emic space” to do so. </p>\n<p>But now the question is what happens if we try to make use of the concept defined by this “region”? Will the “points in the region” behave coherently, or will everything be “shredded”, with different specific representations in terms of emes leading to different conclusions?</p>\n<p>The expectation is that in most cases it will work much like physical space, and that what we as observers perceive will be quite independent of the detailed underlying behavior at the level of emes. Which is why we can expect to do “higher-level mathematics”, without always having to descend to the level of emes, or even axioms.</p>\n<p>And this we can consider as the first great “physicalized law of mathematics”: that coherent higher-level mathematics is possible for us for the same reason that physical space seems coherent to observers like us. </p>\n<p>We’ve discussed several times before the analogy to the Second Law of thermodynamics—and the way it makes possible a higher-level description of things like fluids for “observers like us”. There are certainly cases where the higher-level description breaks down. Some of them may involve specific probes of molecular structure (like Brownian motion). Others may be slightly more “unwitting” (like hypersonic flow). </p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we’re very interested in where similar breakdowns might occur—because they’d allow us to “see below” the traditional continuum description of space. Potential targets involve various extreme or singular configurations of spacetime, where in effect the “coherent observer” gets “shredded”, because different atoms of space “within the observer” do different things. </p>\n<p><a name='shredding-of-observers'></a>In mathematics, this kind of “shredding” of the observer will tend to be manifest in the need to “drop below” higher-level mathematical concepts, and go down to a very detailed axiomatic, metamathematical or even eme level—where computational irreducibility and phenomena like undecidability are rampant.</p>\n<p>It’s worth emphasizing that from the point of view of pure axiomatic mathematics it’s not at all obvious that higher-level mathematics should be possible. It could be that there’d be no choice but to work through every axiomatic detail to have any chance of making conclusions in mathematics. </p>\n<p>But the point is that we now know there could be exactly the same issue in physics. Because our Physics Project implies that at the lowest level our universe is effectively made of emes that have all sorts of complicated—and computationally irreducible—behavior. Yet we know that we don’t have to trace through all the details of this to make conclusions about what will happen in the universe—at least at the level we normally perceive it. </p>\n<p>In other words, the fact that we can successfully have a “high-level view” of what happens in physics is something that fundamentally has the same origin as the fact that we can successfully have a high-level view of what happens in mathematics. Both are just features of how observers like us sample the ruliad that underlies both physics and mathematics.</p>\n<h2 id='uniformity-and-motion-in-metamathematical-space'><span>24 | </span>Uniformity and Motion in Metamathematical Space</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed how the basic concept of space as we experience it in physics leads us to our first great physicalized law of mathematics—and how this provides for the very possibility of higher-level mathematics. But this is just the beginning of what we can learn from thinking about the correspondences between physical and metamathematical space implied by their common origin in the structure of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>A key idea is to think of a limit of mathematics in which one is dealing with so many mathematical statements that one can treat them “in bulk”—as forming something we could consider a continuous metamathematical space. But what might this space be like?</p>\n<p>Our experience of physical space is that at our scale and with our means of perception it seems to us for the most part quite simple and uniform. And this is deeply connected to the concept that pure motion is possible in physical space—or, in other words, that it’s possible for things to move around in physical space without fundamentally changing their character.</p>\n<p>Looked at from the point of view of the atoms of space it’s not at all obvious that this should be possible. After all, whenever we move we’ll almost inevitably be made up of different atoms of space. But it’s fundamental to our character as observers that the features we end up perceiving are ones that have a certain persistence—so that we can imagine that we, and objects around us, can just “move unchanged”, at least with respect to those aspects of the objects that we perceive. And this is why, for example, we can discuss laws of mechanics without having to “drop down” to the level of the atoms of space.</p>\n<p>So what’s the analog of all this in metamathematical space? At the present stage of our physical universe, we seem to be able to experience physical space as having features like being basically three-dimensional. Metamathematical space probably doesn’t have such familiar mathematical characterizations. But it seems very likely (and we’ll see some evidence of this from <a href='#empirical-metamathematics'>empirical metamathematics below</a>) that at the very least we’ll perceive metamathematical space as having a certain uniformity or homogeneity.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we imagine that we can think of physical space as <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/cosmology-expansion-and-singularities/' target=_blank rel=noopener>beginning “at the Big Bang”</a> with what amounts to some small collection of atoms of space, but then growing to the vast number of atoms in our current universe through the repeated application of particular rules. But with a small set of rules being applied a vast number of times, it seems almost inevitable that some kind of uniformity must result.</p>\n<p>But then the same kind of thing can be expected in metamathematics. In axiomatic mathematics one imagines the mathematical analog of the Big Bang: everything starts from a small collection of axioms, and then expands to a huge number of mathematical statements through repeated application of laws of inference. And from this picture (which gets a bit more elaborate when one considers emes and the full ruliad) one can expect that at least after it’s “developed for a while” metamathematical space, like physical space, will have a certain uniformity.</p>\n<p>The idea that physical space is somehow uniform is something we take very much for granted, not least because that’s our lifelong experience. But the analog of this idea for metamathematical space is something we don’t have immediate everyday intuition about—and that in fact may at first seem surprising or even bizarre. But actually what it implies is something that increasingly rings true from modern experience in pure mathematics. Because by saying that metamathematical space is in a sense uniform, we’re saying that different parts of it somehow seem similar—or in other words that there’s parallelism between what we see in different areas of mathematics, even if they’re not “nearby” in terms of entailments.</p>\n<p>But this is exactly what, for example, the success of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--category-theory/'>category theory</a> implies. Because it shows us that even in completely different areas of mathematics it makes sense to set up the same basic structures of objects, morphisms and so on. As such, though, category theory defines only the barest outlines of mathematical structure. But what our concept of perceived uniformity in metamathematical space suggests is that there should in fact be closer correspondences between different areas of mathematics.</p>\n<p>We can view this as another fundamental “physicalized law of mathematics”: that different areas of mathematics should ultimately have structures that are in some deep sense “perceived the same” by mathematical observers. For several centuries we’ve known there’s a certain correspondence between, for example, geometry and algebra. But it’s been a major achievement of recent mathematics to identify more and more such correspondences or “dualities”. </p>\n<p>Often the existence of these has seemed remarkable, and surprising. But what our view of metamathematics here suggests is that this is actually a general physicalized law of mathematics—and that in the end essentially all different areas of mathematics must share a deep structure, at least in some appropriate “bulk metamathematical limit” when enough statements are considered.</p>\n<p>But it’s one thing to say that two places in metamathematical space are “similar”; it’s another to say that “motion between them” is possible. Once again we can make an analogy with physical space. We’re used to the idea that we can move around in space, maintaining our identity and structure. But this in a sense requires that we can maintain some kind of continuity of existence on our path between two positions.</p>\n<p>In principle it could have been that we would have to be “atomized” at one end, then “reconstituted” at the other end. But our actual experience is that we perceive ourselves to continually exist all the way along the path. In a sense this is just an assumption about how things work that physical observers like us make; but what’s nontrivial is that the underlying structure of the ruliad implies that this will always be consistent.</p>\n<p>And so we expect it will be in metamathematics. Like a physical observer, the way a mathematical observer operates, it’ll be possible to “move” from one area of mathematics to another “at a high level”, without being “atomized” along the way. Or, in other words, that a mathematical observer will be able to make correspondences between different areas of mathematics without having to go down to the level of emes to do so.</p>\n<p>It’s worth realizing that as soon as there’s a way of representing mathematics in computational terms the concept of universal computation (and, more tightly, the Principle of Computational Equivalence) implies that at some level there must always be a way to translate between any two mathematical theories, or any two areas of mathematics. But the question is whether it’s possible to do this in “high-level mathematical terms” or only at the level of the underlying “computational substrate”. And what we’re saying is that there’s a general physicalized law of mathematics that implies that higher-level translation should be possible.</p>\n<p>Thinking about mathematics at a traditional axiomatic level can sometimes obscure this, however. For example, in axiomatic terms we usually think of Peano arithmetic as not being as powerful as ZFC set theory (for example, it lacks <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--universality-of-set-theory/'>transfinite induction</a>)—and so nothing like “dual” to it. But Peano arithmetic can perfectly well support universal computation, so inevitably a “formal emulator” for ZFC set theory can be built in it. But the issue is that to do this essentially requires going down to the “atomic” level and operating not in terms of mathematical constructs but instead directly in terms of “metamathematical” symbolic structure (and, for example, explicitly emulating things like equality predicates).</p>\n<p>But the issue, it seems, is that if we think at the traditional axiomatic level, we’re not dealing with a “mathematical observer like us”. In the analogy we’ve used above, we’re operating at the “molecular dynamics” level, not at the human-scale “fluid dynamics” level. And so we see all sorts of details and issues that ultimately won’t be relevant in typical approaches to actually doing pure mathematics. </p>\n<p>It’s somewhat ironic that our physicalized approach shows this by going below the axiomatic level—to the level of emes and the raw ruliad. But in a sense it’s only at this level that there’s the uniformity and coherence to conveniently construct a general picture that can encompass observers like us.</p>\n<p>Much as with ordinary matter we can say that “everything is made of atoms”, we’re now saying that everything is “made of computation” (and its structure and behavior is ultimately described by the ruliad). But the crucial idea that emerged from our Physics Project—and that is at the core of what I’m calling the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a>—is that when we ask what observers perceive there is a whole additional level of inexorable structure. And this is what makes it possible to do both human-scale physics and higher-level mathematics—and for there to be what amounts to “pure motion”, whether in physical or metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>There’s another way to think about this, that we alluded to earlier. A key feature of an observer is to have a coherent identity. In physics, that involves having a consistent thread of experience in time. In mathematics, it involves bringing together a consistent view of “what’s true” in the space of mathematical statements. </p>\n<p>In both cases the observer will in effect involve many separate underlying elements (ultimately, emes). But in order to maintain the observer’s view of having a coherent identity, the observer must somehow conflate all these elements, effectively treating them as “the same”. In physics, this means “coarse-graining” across physical or branchial (or, in fact, rulial) space. In mathematics, this means “coarse-graining” across metamathematical space—or in effect treating different mathematical statements as “the same”.</p>\n<p>In practice, there are several ways this happens. First of all, one tends to be more concerned about mathematical results than their proofs, so two statements that have the same form can be considered the same even if the proofs (or other processes) that generated them are different (and indeed this is something we have routinely done in constructing entailment cones here). But there’s more. One can also imagine that any statements that entail each other can be considered “the same”. </p>\n<p>In a simple case, this means that if <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img1A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img2A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> then one can always assume <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/26sw0219img3A.png\" width= '35' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span>. But there’s a much more general version of this embodied in the <a href='https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201309/rnoti-p1164.pdf?trk=2013091164&#038;cat=collection' target=_blank rel=noopener>univalence axiom of homotopy type theory</a>—that in our terms can be interpreted as saying that mathematical observers consider equivalent things the same.</p>\n<p>There’s another way that mathematical observers conflate different statements—that’s in many ways more important, but less formal. As we mentioned above, when mathematicians talk, say, about the Pythagorean theorem, they typically think they have a definite concept in mind. But at the axiomatic level—and even more so at the level of emes—there are a huge number of different “metamathematical configurations” that are all “considered the same” by the typical working mathematician, or by our “mathematical observer”. (At the level of axioms, there might be different axiom systems for real numbers; at the level of emes there might be different ways of representing concepts like addition or equality.)</p>\n<p>In a sense we can think of mathematical observers as having a certain <a href='#counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'>“extent” in metamathematical space</a>. And much like human-scale physical observers see only the aggregate effects of huge numbers of atoms of space, so also mathematical observers see only the “aggregate effects” of huge numbers of emes of metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>But now the key question is whether a “whole mathematical observer” can “move in metamathematical space” as a single “rigid” entity, or whether it will inevitably be distorted—or shredded—by the structure of metamathematical space. In the next section we’ll discuss the analog of gravity—and curvature—in metamathematical space. But our physicalized approach tends to suggest that in “most” of metamathematical space, a typical mathematical observer will be able to “move around freely”, implying that there will indeed be paths or “bridges” between different areas of mathematics, that involve only higher-level mathematical constructs, and don’t require dropping down to the level of emes and the raw ruliad.</p>\n<h2 id='gravitational-and-relativistic-effects-in-metamathematics'><span>25 | </span>Gravitational and Relativistic Effects in Metamathematics</h2>\n<p>If metamathematical space is like physical space, does that mean that it has <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-gravity'>analogs of gravity</a>, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#deriving-special-relativity'>relativity</a>? The answer seems to be “yes”—and these provide our next examples of physicalized laws of mathematics. </p>\n<p>In the end, we’re going to be able to talk about at least gravity in a largely “static” way, referring mostly to the “instantaneous state of metamathematics”, captured as an entailment fabric. But in leveraging ideas from physics, it’s important to start off formulating things in terms of the analog of time for metamathematics—which is entailment.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, the entailment cone is the direct analog of the light cone in physics. Starting with some mathematical statement (or, more accurately, some event that transforms it) the forward entailment cone contains all statements (or, more accurately, events) that follow from it. Any possible “instantaneous state of metamathematics” then corresponds to a “transverse slice” through this entailment cone—with the slice in effect being laid out in metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>An individual entailment of one statement by another corresponds to a path in the entailment cone, and this path (or, more accurately for accumulative evolution, subgraph) can be thought of as a proof of one statement given another. And in these terms the shortest proof can be thought of as a geodesic in the entailment cone. (In practical mathematics, it’s very unlikely one will find—or care about—the strictly shortest proof. But even having a “fairly short proof” will be enough to give the general conclusions we’ll discuss here.)</p>\n<p>Given a path in the entailment cone, we can imagine projecting it onto a transverse slice, i.e. onto an entailment fabric. Being able to consistently do this depends on having a certain uniformity in the entailment cone, and in the sequence of “metamathematical hypersurfaces” that are defined by whatever “metamathematical reference frame” we’re using. But assuming, for example, that underlying computational irreducibility successfully generates a kind of “statistical uniformity” that cannot be “decoded” by the observer, we can expect to have meaningful paths—and geodesics—on entailment fabrics.</p>\n<p>But what these geodesics are like then depends on the emergent geometry of entailment fabrics. In physics, the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/limiting-behavior-and-emergent-geometry/' target=_blank rel=noopener>limiting geometry</a> of the analog of this for physical space is presumably a fairly simple 3D manifold. For <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/typical-forms-of-branchial-graphs/' target=_blank rel=noopener>branchial space, it&#8217;s more complicated</a>, probably for example being “exponential dimensional”. And for metamathematics, the limiting geometry is also undoubtedly more complicated—and almost certainly exponential dimensional. </p>\n<p>We’ve <a href='#uniformity-and-motion-in-metamathematical-space'>argued that we expect</a> metamathematical space to have a certain perceived uniformity. But what will affect this, and therefore potentially modify the local geometry of the space? The basic answer is exactly the same as in our Physics Project. If there’s “more activity” somewhere in an entailment fabric, this will in effect lead to “more local connections”, and thus effective “positive local curvature” in the emergent geometry of the network. Needless to say, exactly what “more activity” means is somewhat subtle, especially given that the fabric in which one is looking for this is itself defining the ambient geometry, measures of “area”, etc.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we make things more precise by associating <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/matter-energy-and-gravitation/' target=_blank rel=noopener>“activity” with energy density</a>, and saying that energy effectively corresponds to the flux of causal edges through spacelike hypersurfaces. So this suggests that we think about an analog of energy in metamathematics: essentially defining it to be the density of update events in the entailment fabric. Or, put another way, energy in metamathematics depends on the “density of proofs” going through a region of metamathematical space, i.e. involving particular “nearby” mathematical statements.</p>\n<p>There are lots of caveats, subtleties and details. But the notion that “activity AKA energy” leads to increasing curvature in an emergent geometry is a general feature of the whole <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/multicomputation-a-fourth-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputational paradigm</a> that the ruliad captures. And in fact we expect a quantitative relationship between energy density (or, strictly, energy-momentum) and induced curvature of the “transversal space”—that corresponds exactly to <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/the-vacuum-einstein-equations/' target=_blank rel=noopener>Einstein&#8217;s equations in general relativity</a>. It’ll be more difficult to see this in the metamathematical case because metamathematical space is geometrically more complicated—and less familiar—than physical space.</p>\n<p>But even at a qualitative level, it seems very helpful to think in terms of physics and spacetime analogies. The basic phenomenon is that geodesics are deflected by the presence of “energy”, in effect being “attracted to it”. And this is why we can think of regions of higher energy (or energy-momentum/mass)—in physics and in metamathematics—as “generating gravity”, and deflecting geodesics towards them. (Needless to say, in metamathematics, as in physics, the vast majority of overall activity is just devoted to knitting together the structure of space, and when gravity is produced, it’s from slightly increased activity in a particular region.)</p>\n<p>(In our Physics Project, a key result is that the same kind of dependence of “spatial” structure on energy happens not only in physical space, but also in branchial space—where there’s a direct analog of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-quantum-mechanics-are-the-same-idea'>general relativity that basically yields the path integral</a> of quantum mechanics.)</p>\n<p>What does this mean in metamathematics? Qualitatively, the implication is that “proofs will tend to go through where there’s a higher density of proofs”. Or, in an analogy, if you want to drive from one place to another, it’ll be more efficient if you can do at least part of your journey on a freeway.</p>\n<p>One question to ask about metamathematical space is whether one can always get from any place to any other. In other words, starting from one area of mathematics, can one somehow derive all others? A key issue here is whether the area one starts from is computation universal. Propositional logic is not, for example. So if one starts from it, one is essentially trapped, and cannot reach other areas.</p>\n<p>But results in mathematical logic have established that most traditional areas of axiomatic mathematics are in fact computation universal (and the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> suggests that this will be ubiquitous). And given computation universality there will at least be some “proof path”. (In a sense this is a reflection of the fact that the ruliad is unique, so everything is connected in “the same ruliad”.)</p>\n<p>But a big question is whether the “proof path” is “big enough” to be appropriate for a “mathematical observer like us”. Can we expect to get from one part of metamathematical space to another without the observer being “shredded”? Will we be able to start from any of a whole collection of places in metamathematical space that are considered “indistinguishably nearby” to a mathematical observer and have all of them “move together” to reach our destination? Or will different specific starting points follow quite different paths—preventing us from having a high-level (“fluid dynamics”) description of what’s going on, and instead forcing us to drop down to the “molecular dynamics” level?</p>\n<p>In practical pure mathematics, this tends to be an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>issue of whether there is an “elegant proof using high-level concepts”</a>, or whether one has to drop down to a very detailed level that’s more like low-level computer code, or the output of an automated theorem proving system. And indeed there’s a very visceral sense of “shredding” in cases where one’s confronted with a proof that consists of page after page of “machine-like details”. </p>\n<p>But there’s another point here as well. If one looks at an individual proof path, it can be computationally irreducible to find out where the path goes, and the question of whether it ever reaches a particular destination can be undecidable. But in most of the current practice of pure mathematics, one’s interested in “higher-level conclusions”, that are “visible” to a mathematical observer who doesn’t resolve individual proof paths. </p>\n<p>Later we’ll discuss the dichotomy between explorations of computational systems that routinely run into undecidability—and the typical experience of pure mathematics, where undecidability is rarely encountered in practice. But the basic point is that what a typical mathematical observer sees is at the “fluid dynamics level”, where the potentially circuitous path of some individual molecule is not relevant.</p>\n<p>Of course, by asking specific questions—about metamathematics, or, say, about <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p787--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>very specific equations</a>—it’s still perfectly possible to force tracing of individual “low-level” proof paths. But this isn’t what’s typical in current pure mathematical practice. And in a sense we can see this as an extension of our first physicalized law of mathematics: not only is higher-level mathematics possible, but it’s ubiquitously so, with the result that, at least in terms of the questions a mathematical observer would readily formulate, phenomena like undecidability are not generically seen.</p>\n<p>But even though undecidability may not be directly visible to a mathematical observer, its underlying presence is still crucial in coherently “knitting together” metamathematical space. Because without undecidability, we won’t have computation universality and computational irreducibility. But—just like in our Physics Project—computational irreducibility is crucial in producing the low-level apparent randomness that is needed to support any kind of “continuum limit” that allows us to think of large collections of what are ultimately discrete emes as building up some kind of coherent geometrical space. </p>\n<p>And when undecidability is not present, one will typically not end up with anything like this kind of coherent space. An extreme example occurs in rewrite systems that eventually terminate—in the sense that they reach a “fixed-point” (or “normal form”) state where no more transformations can be applied.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project, this kind of termination can be <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/' target=_blank rel=noopener>interpreted as a spacelike singularity</a> at which “time stops” (as at the center of a non-rotating black hole). But in general decidability is associated with “limits on how far paths can go”—just like the limits on causal paths associated with event horizons in physics.</p>\n<p>There are many details to work out, but the qualitative picture can be developed further. In physics, the singularity theorems imply that in essence the eventual formation of spacetime singularities is inevitable. And there should be a direct analog in our context that implies the eventual formation of “metamathematical singularities”. In qualitative terms, we can expect that the presence of proof density (which is the analog of energy) will “pull in” more proofs until eventually there are so many proofs that one has decidability and a “proof event horizon” is formed.</p>\n<p>In a sense this implies that the long-term future of mathematics is strangely similar to the long-term future of our physical universe. In our physical universe, we expect that while the expansion of space may continue, many parts of the universe will form black holes and essentially be “closed off”. (At least ignoring expansion in branchial space, and quantum effects in general.)</p>\n<p>The analog of this in mathematics is that while there can be continued overall expansion in metamathematical space, more and more parts of it will “burn out” because they’ve become decidable. In other words, as more work and more proofs get done in a particular area, that area will eventually be “finished”—and there will be no more “open-ended” questions associated with it.</p>\n<p>In physics there’s sometimes discussion of white holes, which are imagined to effectively be time-reversed black holes, spewing out all possible material that could be captured in a black hole. In metamathematics, a white hole is like a statement that is false and therefore “leads to an explosion”. The presence of such an object in metamathematical space will in effect cause observers to be shredded—making it inconsistent with the coherent construction of higher-level mathematics. </p>\n<p>We’ve talked at some length about the “gravitational” structure of metamathematical space. But what about seemingly simpler things like special relativity? In physics, there’s a notion of basic, flat spacetime, for which it’s easy to construct families of reference frames, and in which parallel trajectories stay parallel. In metamathematics, the analog is presumably metamathematical space in which “parallel proof geodesics” remain “parallel”—so that in effect one can continue “making progress in mathematics” by just “keeping on doing what you’ve been doing”.</p>\n<p>And somehow relativistic invariance is associated with the idea that there are many ways to do math, but in the end they’re all able to reach the same conclusions. Ultimately this is something one expects as a consequence of fundamental features of the ruliad—and the <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/multiway-systems-in-the-space-of-all-possible-rules/#p-474' target=_blank rel=noopener>inevitability of causal invariance</a> in it resulting from the <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/'>Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. It’s also something that might seem quite familiar from practical mathematics and, say, from the ability to do derivations using different methods—like from either geometry or algebra—and yet still end up with the same conclusions. </p>\n<p>So if there’s an analog of relativistic invariance, what about analogs of phenomena like time dilation? In our Physics Project <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/motion-and-special-relativity/' target=_blank rel=noopener>time dilation has a rather direct interpretation</a>. To “progress in time” takes a certain amount of computational work. But motion in effect also takes a certain amount of computational work—in essence to continually recreate versions of something in different places. But from the ruliad on up there is ultimately only a certain amount of computational work that can be done—and if computational work is being “used up” on motion, there is less available to devote to progress in time, and so time will effectively run more slowly, leading to the experience of time dilation.</p>\n<p>So what is the metamathematical analog of this? Presumably it’s that when you do derivations in math you can either stay in one area and directly make progress in that area, or you can “base yourself in some other area” and make progress only by continually translating back and forth. But ultimately that translation process will take computational work, and so will slow down your progress—leading to an analog of time dilation. </p>\n<p>In physics, the speed of light defines the maximum amount of motion in space that can occur in a certain amount of time. In metamathematics, the analog is that there’s a maximum “translation distance” in metamathematical space that can be “bridged” with a certain amount of derivation. In physics we’re used to measuring spatial distance in meters—and time in seconds. In metamathematics we don’t yet have familiar units in which to measure, say, distance between mathematical concepts—or, for that matter, “amount of derivation” being done. But with the empirical metamathematics we’ll discuss in the next section we actually have the beginnings of a way to define such things, and to use what’s been achieved in the history of human mathematics to at least imagine “empirically measuring” what we might call “maximum metamathematical speed”.</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that we are only at the very beginning of exploring things like the analogs of relativity in metamathematics. One important piece of formal structure that we haven’t really discussed here is causal dependence, and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-graph-of-causal-relationships'>causal graphs</a>. We’ve talked at length about statements entailing other statements. But we haven’t talked about questions like which part of which statement is needed for some event to occur that will entail some other statement. And—while there’s no fundamental difficulty in doing it—we haven’t concerned ourselves with <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/#causal-graphs-and-the-physicalization-of-combinators'>constructing causal graphs</a> to represent causal relationships and causal dependencies between events. </p>\n<p>When it comes to physical observers, there is a very direct interpretation of causal graphs that relates to what a physical observer can experience. But for mathematical observers—where the notion of time is less central—it’s less clear just what the interpretation of causal graphs should be. But one certainly expects that they will enter in the construction of any general “observer theory” that characterizes “observers like us” across both physics and mathematics. </p>\n<h2 id='empirical-metamathematics'><span>26 | </span>Empirical Metamathematics</h2>\n<p>We’ve discussed the overall structure of metamathematical space, and the general kind of sampling that we humans do of it (as “mathematical observers”) when we do mathematics. But what can we learn from the specifics of human mathematics, and the actual mathematical statements that humans have published over the centuries?</p>\n<p>We might imagine that these statements are just ones that—as “accidents of history”—humans have “happened to find interesting”. But there’s definitely more to it—and potentially what’s there is a rich source of “empirical data” relevant to our physicalized laws of mathematics, and to what amounts to their “experimental validation”.</p>\n<p>The situation with “human settlements” in metamathematical space is in a sense rather similar to the situation with human settlements in physical space. If we look at where humans have chosen to live and build cities, we’ll find a bunch of locations in 3D space. The details of where these are depend on history and many factors. But there’s a clear overarching theme, that’s in a sense a direct reflection of underlying physics: all the locations lie on the more-or-less spherical surface of the Earth.</p>\n<p>It’s not so straightforward to see what’s going on in the metamathematical case, not least because any notion of coordinatization seems to be much more complicated for metamathematical space than for physical space. But we can still begin by <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>doing “empirical metamathematics”</a> and asking questions about for example what amounts to where in metamathematical space we humans have so far established ourselves.

We <a href='#going-below-axiomatic-mathematics'>discussed above</a> how constructs like numbers and logic can be obtained from a combinator representation of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>We can view the definition dependency graph above as being an empirical example of how somewhat higher-level definitions can be built up. From a computer science perspective, we can think of it as being like a type hierarchy. From a physics perspective, it’s as if we’re starting from atoms, then building up to molecules and beyond. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out, however, that even the top of the definition hierarchy in something like Metamath is still operating very much at an axiomatic kind of level. In the analogy we&#8217;ve been using, it&#8217;s still for the most part “formulating math at the molecular dynamics level” not at the more human “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>We’ve been talking about “the Pythagorean theorem”. But even on the basis of set theory there are many different possible formulations one can give. In Metamath, for example, there is the <a href='https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pythag.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>pythag version</a> (which is what we’ve been using), and there is also a (somewhat more general) <a href='https://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pythi.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>pythi version</a>.

But the framework we’ve built here in a sense blends them both into a rather unexpected synthesis.</p>\n<p>The starting point is the idea that mathematics—like physics—is rooted in the ruliad, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>which is a representation of formal necessity</a>. Actual mathematics as we “experience” it is—like physics—based on the particular sampling we make of the ruliad. But then the crucial point is that very basic characteristics of us as “observers” are sufficient to constrain that experience to be our general mathematics—or our physics.</p>\n<p>At some level we can say that “mathematics is always there”—because every aspect of it is ultimately encoded in the ruliad. But in another sense we can say that the mathematics we have is all “up to us”—because it’s based on how we sample the ruliad. But the point is that that sampling is not somehow “arbitrary”: if we’re talking about mathematics for us humans then it’s us ultimately doing the sampling, and the sampling is inevitably constrained by general features of our nature.</p>\n<p>A major discovery from our Physics Project is that it doesn’t take much in the way of constraints on the observer to deeply constrain the laws of physics they will perceive. And similarly we posit here that for “observers like us” there will inevitably be general (“physicalized”) laws of mathematics, that make mathematics inevitably have the general kinds of characteristics we perceive it to have (such as the possibility of doing mathematics at a high level, without always having to drop down to an “atomic” level).</p>\n<p>Particularly over the past century there’s been the idea that mathematics can be specified in terms of axiom systems, and that these axiom systems can somehow be “invented at will”. But our framework does two things. First, it says that “far below” axiom systems is the raw ruliad, which in a sense represents all possible axiom systems. And second, it says that whatever axiom systems we perceive to be “operating” will be ones that we as observers can pick out from the underlying structure of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>At a formal level we can “invent” an arbitrary axiom system (and it’ll be somewhere in the ruliad), but only certain axiom systems will be ones that describe what we as “mathematical observers” can perceive. In a physics setting we might construct some formal physical theory that talks about detailed patterns in the atoms of space (or molecules in a gas), but the kind of “coarse-grained” observations that we can make won’t capture these. Put another way, observers like us can perceive certain kinds of things, and can describe things in terms of these perceptions. But with the wrong kind of theory—or “axioms”—these descriptions won’t be sufficient—and only an observer who’s “shredded” down to a more “atomic” level will be able to track what’s going on.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of different possible math—and physics—in the ruliad. But observers like us can only “access” a certain type. Some putative alien not like us might access a different type—and might end up with both a different math and a different physics. Deep underneath they—like us—would be talking about the ruliad. But they’d be taking different samples of it, and describing different aspects of it.</p>\n<p>For much of the history of mathematics there was a close alignment between the mathematics that was done and what we perceive in the world. For example, Euclidean geometry—with its whole axiomatic structure—was originally conceived just as an idealization of geometrical things that we observe about the world. But by the late 1800s the idea had emerged that one could create “disembodied” axiomatic systems with no particular grounding in our experience in the world. </p>\n<p>And, yes, there are many possible <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p804--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>disembodied axiom systems that one can set up</a>. And in doing <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a> and generally <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>exploring the computational universe</a> it’s interesting to investigate what they do. But the point is that this is something quite different from mathematics as mathematics is normally conceived. Because in a sense mathematics—like physics—is a “more human” activity that’s based on what “observers like us” make of the raw formal structure that is ultimately embodied in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>When it comes to physics there are, it seems, two crucial features of “observers like us”. First, that we’re computationally bounded. And second, that we have the perception that we’re persistent—and have a definite and continuous thread of experience. At the level of atoms of space, we’re in a sense constantly being “remade”. But we nevertheless perceive it as always being the “same us”.</p>\n<p>This single seemingly simple assumption <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>has far-reaching consequences</a>. For example, it leads us to experience a single thread of time. And from the notion that we maintain a continuity of experience from every successive moment to the next we are inexorably led to the idea of a perceived continuum—not only in time, but also for motion and in space. And when combined with intrinsic features of the ruliad and of multicomputation in general, what comes out in the end is a surprisingly precise description of how we’ll perceive our universe to operate—that seems to correspond exactly with known core laws of physics.</p>\n<p>What does that kind of thinking tell us about mathematics? The basic point is that—since in the end both relate to humans—there is necessarily a close correspondence between physical and mathematical observers. Both are computationally bounded. And the assumption of persistence in time for physical observers becomes for mathematical observers the concept of maintaining coherence as more statements are accumulated. And when combined with intrinsic features of the ruliad and multicomputation this then turns out to imply the kind of physicalized laws of mathematics that we’ve discussed.</p>\n<p>In a formal axiomatic view of mathematics one just imagines that one invents axioms and sees their consequences. But what we’re describing here is a view of mathematics that is ultimately just about the ways that we as mathematical observers sample and experience the ruliad. And if we use axiom systems it has to be as a kind of “intermediate language” that helps us make a slightly higher-level description of some corner of the raw ruliad. But actual “human-level” mathematics—like human-level physics—operates at a higher level.</p>\n<p>Our everyday experience of the physical world gives us the impression that we have a kind of “direct access” to many foundational features of physics, like the existence of space and the phenomenon of motion. But our Physics Project implies that these are not concepts that are in any sense “already there”; they are just things that emerge from the raw ruliad when you “parse” it in the kinds of ways observers like us do. </p>\n<p>In mathematics it’s less obvious (at least to all but perhaps experienced pure mathematicians) that there’s “direct access” to anything. But in our view of mathematics here, it’s ultimately just like physics—and ultimately also rooted in the ruliad, but sampled not by physical observers but by mathematical ones. </p>\n<p>So from this point view there’s <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>just as much that&#8217;s “real” underneath mathematics as there is underneath physics</a>. The mathematics is sampled slightly differently (though very similarly)—but we should not in any sense consider it “fundamentally more abstract”. </p>\n<p>When we think of ourselves as entities within the ruliad, we can build up what we might consider a “fully abstract” description of how we get our “experience” of physics. And we can basically do the same thing for mathematics. So if we take the commonsense point of view that physics fundamentally exists “for real”, we’re <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>forced into the same point of view for mathematics</a>. In other words, if we say that the physical universe exists, so must we also say that in some fundamental sense, mathematics also exists.</p>\n<p>It’s not something we as humans “just make”, but it is something that is made through our particular way of observing the ruliad, that is ultimately defined by our particular characteristics as observers, with our particular core assumptions about the world, our particular kinds of sensory experience, and so on.</p>\n<p>So what can we say in the end about whether mathematics is “invented” or “discovered”? It is neither. Its underpinnings are the ruliad, whose structure is a matter of formal necessity. But its perceived form for us is determined by our intrinsic characteristics as observers. We neither get to “arbitrarily invent” what’s underneath, nor do we get to “arbitrarily discover” what’s already there. The mathematics we see is the result of a combination of formal necessity in the underlying ruliad, and the particular forms of perception that we—as entities like us—have. Putative aliens could have quite different mathematics, but not because the underlying ruliad is any different for them, but because their forms of perception might be different. And it’s the same with physics: even though they “live in the same physical universe” their perception of the laws of physics could be quite different.</p>\n<h2 id='what-axioms-can-there-be-for-human-mathematics'><span>28 | </span>What Axioms Can There Be for Human Mathematics?</h2>\n<p>When they were first developed in antiquity the axioms of Euclidean geometry were presumably intended basically as a kind of “tightening” of our everyday impressions of geometry—that would aid in being able to deduce what was true in geometry. But by the mid-1800s—between non-Euclidean geometry, group theory, Boolean algebra and quaternions—it had become clear that there was a range of abstract axiom systems one could in principle consider. And by the time of Hilbert’s program around 1900 the pure process of deduction was in effect being viewed as an end in itself—and indeed the core of mathematics—with axiom systems being seen as “starter material” pretty much just “determined by convention”.</p>\n<p>In practice even today very few different axiom systems are ever commonly used—and indeed in <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em> I was able to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p773--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>list essentially all of them comfortably on a couple of pages</a>. But why these axiom systems and not others? Despite the idea that axiom systems could ultimately be arbitrary, the concept was still that in studying some particular area of mathematics one should basically have an axiom system that would provide a “tight specification” of whatever mathematical object or structure one was trying to talk about. And so, for example, the Peano axioms are what became used for talking about arithmetic-style operations on integers.</p>\n<p>In 1931, however, Gödel’s theorem showed that actually these axioms weren’t strong enough to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p800--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>constrain one to be talking only about integers</a>: there were also other possible models of the axiom system, involving all sorts of exotic “<a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--non-standard-arithmetic/'>non-standard arithmetic</a>”. (And moreover, there was no finite way to “patch” this issue.) In other words, even though the Peano axioms had been invented—like Euclid’s axioms for geometry—as a way to describe a definite “intuitive” mathematical thing (in this case, integers) their formal axiomatic structure “had a life of its own” that extended (in some sense, infinitely) beyond its original intended purpose.</p>\n<p>Both geometry and arithmetic in a sense had foundations in everyday experience. But for <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>set theory dealing with infinite sets</a> there was never an obvious intuitive base rooted in everyday experience. Some extrapolations from finite sets were clear. But in covering infinite sets various axioms (like the Axiom of Choice) were gradually added to capture what seemed like “reasonable” mathematical assertions.</p>\n<p>But one example whose status for a long time wasn’t clear was the Continuum Hypothesis—which asserts that the “next distinct possible cardinality” <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img1A.png\" width= '17' height='19' align='absmiddle'></span> after the cardinality <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img2A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> of the integers is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img3A.png\" width= '25' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span>: the cardinality of real numbers (i.e. of “the continuum”). Was this something that followed from previously accepted axioms of set theory? And if it was added, would it even be consistent with them? In the early 1960s it was established that actually the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of the other axioms.</p>\n<p>With the axiomatic view of the foundations of mathematics that’s been popular for the past century or so it seems as if one could, for example, just choose at will whether to include the Continuum Hypothesis (or its negation) as an axiom in set theory. But with the approach to the foundations of mathematics that we’ve developed here, this is no longer so clear.</p>\n<p>Recall that in our approach, everything is ultimately rooted in the ruliad—with whatever mathematics observers like us “experience” just being the result of the particular sampling we do of the ruliad. And in this picture, axiom systems are a particular representation of fairly low-level features of the sampling we do of the raw ruliad. </p>\n<p>If we could do any kind of sampling we want of the ruliad, then we’d presumably be able to get all possible axiom systems—as intermediate-level “waypoints” representing different kinds of slices of the ruliad. But in fact by our nature we are observers capable of only certain kinds of sampling of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>We could imagine “alien observers” not like us who could for example make whatever choice they want about the Continuum Hypothesis. But given our general characteristics as observers, we may be forced into a particular choice. Operationally, as we’ve discussed above, the wrong choice could, for example, be incompatible with an observer who “maintains coherence” in metamathematical space.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a particular axiom stated in standard symbolic form. “Underneath” this axiom there will typically be at the level of the raw ruliad a huge cloud of possible configurations of emes that can represent the axiom. But an “observer like us” can only deal with a coarse-grained version in which all these different configurations are somehow considered equivalent. And if the entailments from “nearby configurations” remain nearby, then everything will work out, and the observer can maintain a coherent view of what’s going, for example just in terms of symbolic statements about axioms.</p>\n<p>But if instead different entailments of raw configurations of emes lead to very different places, the observer will in effect be “shredded”—and instead of having definite coherent “single-minded” things to say about what happens, they’ll have to separate everything into all the different cases for different configurations of emes. Or, as we’ve said it before, the observer will inevitably end up getting “shredded”—and not be able to come up with definite mathematical conclusions.</p>\n<p>So what specifically can we say about the Continuum Hypothesis? It’s not clear. But conceivably we can start by thinking of <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img4A.png\" width= '19' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> as characterizing the “base cardinality” of the ruliad, while <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/30sw0223img5A.png\" width= '25' height='21' align='absmiddle'></span> characterizes the base cardinality of a first-level <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#whats-beyond-the-ruliad?'>hyperruliad</a> that could for example be based on Turing machines with oracles for their halting problems. And it could be that for us to conclude that the Continuum Hypothesis is false, we’d have to somehow be straddling the ruliad and the hyperruliad, which would be inconsistent with us maintaining a coherent view of mathematics. In other words, the Continuum Hypothesis might somehow be equivalent to what we’ve argued before is in a sense the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#is-this-the-only-universe?'>most fundamental “contingent fact”</a>—that just as we live in a particular location in physical space—so also we live in the ruliad and not the hyperruliad. </p>\n<p>We might have thought that whatever we might see—or construct—in mathematics would in effect be “entirely abstract” and independent of anything about physics, or our experience in the physical world. But particularly insofar as we’re thinking about mathematics as done by humans we’re dealing with “mathematical observers” that are “made of the same stuff” as physical observers. And this means that whatever general constraints or features exist for physical observers we can expect these to carry over to mathematical observers—so it’s no coincidence that both physical and mathematical observers have the same core characteristics, of computational boundedness and “assumption of coherence”. </p>\n<p>And what this means is that there’ll be a fundamental correlation between things familiar from our experience in the physical world and what shows up in our mathematics. We might have thought that the fact that Euclid’s original axioms were based on our human perceptions of physical space would be a sign that in some “overall picture” of mathematics they should be considered arbitrary and not in any way central. But the point is that in fact our notions of space are central to our characteristics as observers. And so it’s inevitable that “physical-experience-informed” axioms like those for Euclidean geometry will be what appear in mathematics for “observers like us”. </p>\n<h2 id='counting-the-emes-of-mathematics-and-physics'><span>29 | </span>Counting the Emes of Mathematics and Physics</h2>\n<p>How does the “size of mathematics” compare to the size of our physical universe? In the past this might have seemed like an absurd question, that tries to compare something abstract and arbitrary with something real and physical. But with the idea that both mathematics and physics as we experience them emerge from our sampling of the ruliad, it begins to seem less absurd.</p>\n<p>At the lowest level the ruliad can be thought of as being made up of atoms of existence that we call emes. As physical observers we interpret these emes as atoms of space, or in effect the ultimate raw material of the physical universe. And as mathematical observers we interpret them as the ultimate elements from which the constructs of mathematics are built. </p>\n<p>As the entangled limit of all possible computations, the whole ruliad is infinite. But we as physical or mathematical observers sample only limited parts of it. And that means we can meaningfully ask questions like how the number of emes in these parts compare—or, in effect, how big is physics as we experience it compared to mathematics.</p>\n<p>In some ways an eme is like a bit. But the concept of emes is that they’re “actual atoms of existence”—from which “actual stuff” like the physical universe and its history are made—rather than just “static informational representations” of it. As soon as we imagine that everything is ultimately computational we are immediately led to start thinking of representing it in terms of bits. But the ruliad is not just a representation. It’s in some way something lower level. It’s the “actual stuff” that everything is made of. And what defines our particular experience of physics or of mathematics is the particular samples we as observers take of what’s in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>So the question is now how many emes there are in those samples. Or, more specifically, how many emes “matter to us” in building up our experience. </p>\n<p>Let’s return to an analogy we’ve used several times before: a gas made of molecules. In the volume of a room there might be <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img1A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> individual molecules, each on average colliding every <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img2A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> seconds. So that means that our “experience of the room” over the course of a minute or so might sample <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img3A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> collisions. Or, in terms closer to our Physics Project, we might say that there are perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img4A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> “collision events” in the causal graph that defines what we experience.</p>\n<p>But these “collision events” aren’t something fundamental; they have what amounts to “internal structure” with many associated parameters about location, time, molecular configuration, etc. </p>\n<p>Our Physics Project, however, suggests that—far below for example our usual notions of space and time—we can in fact have a truly fundamental definition of what’s happening in the universe, ultimately in terms of emes. We don’t yet know the “physical scale” for this—and in the end we presumably need experiments to determine that. But <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/units-and-scales/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rather rickety estimates</a> based on a variety of assumptions suggest that the elementary length might be around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img5A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> meters, with the elementary time being around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img6A.png\" width= '44' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> seconds.</p>\n<p>And with these estimates we might conclude that our “experience of a room for a minute” would involve sampling perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img7A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> update events, that create about this number of atoms of space.</p>\n<p>But it’s immediately clear that this is in a sense a gross underestimate of the total number of emes that we’re sampling. And the reason is that we’re not accounting for quantum mechanics, and for the multiway nature of the evolution of the universe. We’ve so far only considered one “thread of time” at one “position in branchial space”. But in fact there are many threads of time, constantly branching and merging. So how many of these do we experience?</p>\n<p>In effect that depends on our size in branchial space. In physical space “human scale” is of order a meter—or perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img8A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> elementary lengths. But how big is it in branchial space? </p>\n<p>The fact that we’re so large compared to the elementary length is the reason that we consistently experience space as something continuous. And the analog in branchial space is that if we’re big compared to the “elementary branchial distance between branches” then we won’t experience the different individual histories of these branches, but only an aggregate “objective reality” in which we conflate together what happens on all the branches. Or, put another way, being large in branchial space is what makes us experience classical physics rather than quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>Our estimates for branchial space are even more rickety than for physical space. But conceivably there are on the order of <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img9A.png\" width= '36' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> “instantaneous parallel threads of time” in the universe, and <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img10A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> encompassed by our instantaneous experience—implying that in our minute-long experience we might sample a total of on the order of close to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img11A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes.</p>\n<p>But even this is a vast underestimate. Yes, it tries to account for our extent in physical space and in branchial space. But then <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/#the-emerging-picture-of-rulial-space' target=_blank rel=noopener>there&#8217;s also rulial space</a>—which in effect is what “fills out” the whole ruliad. So how big are we in that space? In essence that’s like asking how many different possible sequences of rules there are that are consistent with our experience. </p>\n<p>The total conceivable number of sequences associated with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img12A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes is roughly the number of possible hypergraphs with <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img13A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> nodes—or around <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img14A.png\" width= '78' height='22' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>. But the actual number consistent with our experience is smaller, in particular as reflected by the fact that we attribute specific laws to our universe. But when we say “specific laws” we have to recognize that there is a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#living-in-rulial-space'>finiteness to our efforts at inductive inference</a> which inevitably makes these laws at least somewhat uncertain to us. And in a sense that uncertainty is what represents our “extent in rulial space”. </p>\n<p>But if we want to count the emes that we “absorb” as physical observers, it’s still going to be a huge number. Perhaps the base may be lower—say <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img15A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>—but there’s still a vast exponent, suggesting that if we include our extent in rulial space, we as physical observers may experience numbers of emes like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img16A.png\" width= '70' height='22' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>But let’s say we go beyond our “everyday human-scale experience”. For example, let’s ask about “experiencing” our whole universe. In physical space, the volume of our current universe is about <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img17A.png\" width= '30' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than “human scale” (while human scale is perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img18A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than the “scale of the atoms of space”). In branchial space, conceivably our current universe is <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img19A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> times larger than “human scale”. But these differences absolutely pale in comparison to the sizes associated with rulial space. </p>\n<p>We might try to go beyond “ordinary human experience” and for example measure things using tools from science and technology. And, yes, we could then think about “experiencing” lengths down to <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img20A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> meters, or something close to “single threads” of quantum histories. But in the end, it’s still the rulial size that dominates, and that’s where we can expect most of the vast number of emes that form of our experience of the physical universe to come from.</p>\n<p>OK, so what about mathematics? When we think about what we might call human-scale mathematics, and talk about things like the Pythagorean theorem, how many emes are there “underneath”? “Compiling” our theorem down to typical traditional mathematical axioms, we’ve seen that we’ll routinely end up with expressions containing, say, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img21A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> symbolic elements. But what happens if we go “below that”, compiling these symbolic elements—which might include things like variables and operators—into “pure computational elements” that we can think of as emes? We’ve seen a few examples, say with combinators, that suggest that for the traditional axiomatic structures of mathematics, we might need another factor of maybe roughly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img22A.png\" width= '30' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>These are incredibly rough estimates, but perhaps there’s a hint that there’s “further to go” to get from human-scale for a physical observer down to atoms of space that correspond to emes, than there is to get from human-scale for a mathematical observer down to emes.</p>\n<p>Just like in physics, however, this kind of “static drill-down” isn’t the whole story for mathematics. When we talk about something like the Pythagorean theorem, we’re really referring to a whole cloud of “human-equivalent” points in metamathematical space. The total number of “possible points” is basically the size of the entailment cone that contains something like the Pythagorean theorem. The “height” of the entailment cone is related to typical lengths of proofs—which for current human mathematics might be perhaps hundreds of steps. </p>\n<p>And this would lead to overall sizes of <a href='#empirical-metamathematics'>entailment cones</a> of very roughly <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img23A.png\" width= '37' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> theorems. But within this “how big” is the cloud of variants corresponding to particular “human-recognized” theorems? Empirical metamathematics could provide additional data on this question. But if we very roughly imagine that half of every proof is “flexible”, we’d end up with things like <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img24A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> variants. So if we asked how many emes correspond to the “experience” of the Pythagorean theorem, it might be, say, <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img25A.png\" width= '32' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>. </p>\n<p>To give an analogy of “everyday physical experience” we might consider a mathematician thinking about mathematical concepts, and maybe in effect pondering a few tens of theorems per minute—implying according to our extremely rough and speculative estimates that while typical “specific human-scale physics experience” might involve <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img26A.png\" width= '38' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes, specific human-scale mathematics experience might involve <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img27A.png\" width= '32' height='20' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span> emes (a number comparable, for example, to the number of physical atoms in our universe). </p>\n<p>What if instead of considering “everyday mathematical experience” we consider <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>all humanly explored mathematics</a>? On the scales we’re describing, the factors are not large. In the history of human mathematics, only a few million theorems have been published. If we think about all the computations that have been done in the service of mathematics, it’s a somewhat larger factor. I suspect <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica'>Mathematica</a> is the dominant contributor here—and we can estimate that the total number of <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language'>Wolfram Language</a> operations corresponding to “human-level mathematics” done so far is perhaps <span class='InlineFormula'><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/31sw0223img28A.png\" width= '31' height='19' align='absmiddle' style='margin-bottom:4px'></span>.</p>\n<p>But just like for physics, all these numbers pale in comparison with those introduced by rulial sizes. We’ve talked essentially about a particular path from emes through specific axioms to theorems. But the ruliad in effect contains all possible axiom systems. And if we start thinking about enumerating these—and effectively “populating all of rulial space”—we’ll end up with exponentially more emes. </p>\n<p>But as with the perceived laws of physics, in mathematics as done by humans it’s actually just a narrow slice of rulial space that we’re sampling. It’s like a generalization of the idea that something like arithmetic as we imagine it can be derived from a whole cloud of possible axiom systems. It’s not just one axiom system; but it’s also not all possible axiom systems. </p>\n<p>One can imagine doing some combination of ruliology and empirical metamathematics to get an estimate of “how broad” human-equivalent axiom systems (and their construction from emes) might be. But the answer seems likely to be much smaller than the kinds of sizes we have been estimating for physics.</p>\n<p>It’s important to emphasize that what we’ve discussed here is extremely rough—and speculative. And indeed I view its main value as being to provide an example of how to imagine thinking through things in the context of the ruliad and the framework around it. But on the basis of what we’ve discussed, we might make the very tentative conclusion that “human-experienced physics” is bigger than “human-experienced mathematics”. Both involve vast numbers of emes. But physics seems to involve a lot more. In a sense—even with all its abstraction—the suspicion is that there’s “less ultimately in mathematics” as far as we’re concerned than there is in physics. Though by any ordinary human standards, mathematics still involves absolutely vast numbers of emes. </p>\n<h2 id='some-historical-and-philosophical-background'><span>30 | </span>Some Historical (and Philosophical) Background</h2>\n<p>The human activity that we now call “mathematics” can presumably trace its origins into prehistory. What might have started as “a single goat”, “a pair of goats”, etc. became a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/05/how-inevitable-is-the-concept-of-numbers/'>story of abstract numbers</a> that could be indicated purely by things like tally marks. In Babylonian times the practicalities of a city-based society led to all sorts of calculations involving arithmetic and geometry—and basically everything we now call “mathematics” <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p792--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>can ultimately be thought of as a generalization of these ideas</a>.</p>\n<p>The tradition of philosophy that emerged in Greek times saw mathematics as a kind of reasoning. But while much of arithmetic (apart from issues of infinity and infinitesimals) could be thought of in explicit calculational ways, precise geometry immediately required an idealization—specifically the concept of a point having no extent, or equivalently, the continuity of space. And in an effort to reason on top of this idealization, there emerged the idea of defining axioms and making abstract deductions from them.</p>\n<p>But what kind of a thing actually was mathematics? Plato talked about things we sense in the external world, and things we conceptualize in our internal thoughts. But he considered mathematics to be at its core an example of a third kind of thing: something from an abstract world of ideal forms. And with our current thinking, there is an immediate resonance between this concept of ideal forms and the concept of the ruliad. </p>\n<p>But for most of the past two millennia of the actual development of mathematics, questions about what it ultimately was lay in the background. An important step was taken in the late 1600s when Newton and others “mathematicized” mechanics, at first presenting what they did in the form of axioms similar to Euclid’s. Through the 1700s mathematics as a practical field was viewed as some kind of precise idealization of features of the world—though with an increasingly elaborate tower of formal derivations constructed in it. Philosophy, meanwhile, typically viewed mathematics—like logic—mostly as an example of a system in which there was a formal process of derivation with a “necessary” structure not requiring reference to the real world.</p>\n<p>But in the first half of the 1800s there arose several examples of systems where axioms—while inspired by features of the world—ultimately seemed to be <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--history-of-concept-of-mathematics/'>“just invented” (e.g. group theory, curved space, quaternions, Boolean algebra, &#8230;)</a>. A push towards increasing rigor (especially for calculus and the nature of real numbers) led to more focus on axiomatization and formalization—which was still further emphasized by the appearance of a few non-constructive “purely formal” proofs.</p>\n<p>But if mathematics was to be formalized, what should its underlying primitives be? One obvious choice seemed to be logic, which had originally been developed by Aristotle as a kind of catalog of human arguments, but two thousand years later felt basic and inevitable. And so it was that Frege, followed by Whitehead and Russell, tried to start “constructing mathematics” from “pure logic” (along with set theory). Logic was in a sense a rather low-level “machine code”, and it took hundreds of pages of unreadable (if impressive-looking) “code” for Whitehead and Russell, in their <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2010/11/100-years-since-principia-mathematica/'>1910 <em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>, to get to 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. </p>\n<p><a href='https://archive.org/details/principiamathema01anwh/page/366/mode/2up' target=_blank rel=noopener><img class='' src='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/32-principia-mathematica-1910A.png' alt='Pages 366–367' title='Pages 366–367' width='620' height=' '/></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, starting around 1900, Hilbert took a slightly different path, essentially representing everything with what we would now call symbolic expressions, and setting up axioms as relations between these. But what axioms should be used? Hilbert seemed to feel that the core of mathematics lay not in any “external meaning” but in the pure formal structure built up from whatever axioms were used. And he imagined that somehow all the truths of mathematics could be “mechanically derived” from axioms, a bit, as he said in a certain resonance with our current views, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/where-did-combinators-come-from-hunting-the-story-of-moses-schonfinkel/#gottingen,-center-of-the-mathematical-universe'>like the “great calculating machine, Nature”</a> does it for physics. </p>\n<p>Not all mathematicians, however, bought into this “formalist” view of what mathematics is. And in 1931 Gödel managed to prove from inside the formal axiom system traditionally used for arithmetic that this system had a fundamental incompleteness that prevented it from ever having anything to say about certain mathematical statements. But Gödel seems to have maintained a more Platonic belief about mathematics: that even though the axiomatic method falls short, the truths of mathematics are in some sense still “all there”, and it’s potentially possible for the human mind to have “direct access” to them. And while this is not quite the same as our picture of the mathematical observer accessing the ruliad, there’s again some definite resonance here.</p>\n<p>But, OK, so how has mathematics actually conducted itself over the past century? Typically there’s at least lip service paid to the idea that there are “axioms underneath”—usually assumed to be those from set theory. There’s been significant emphasis placed on the idea of formal deduction and proof—but not so much in terms of formally building up from axioms as in terms of giving narrative expositions that help humans understand why some theorem might follow from other things they know.</p>\n<p>There’s been a field of “mathematical logic” concerned with using mathematics-like methods to explore mathematics-like aspects of formal axiomatic systems. But (at least until very recently) there’s been rather little interaction between this and the “mainstream” study of mathematics. And for example phenomena like undecidability that are central to mathematical logic have seemed rather remote from typical pure mathematics—even though many actual long-unsolved problems in mathematics do seem likely to run into it.</p>\n<p>But even if formal axiomatization may have been something of a sideshow for mathematics, its ideas have brought us what is without much doubt the single most important intellectual breakthrough of the twentieth century: the abstract concept of computation. And what’s now become clear is that computation is in some fundamental sense much more general than mathematics.</p>\n<p>At a philosophical level one can view the ruliad as containing all computation. But mathematics (at least as it’s done by humans) is defined by what a “mathematical observer like us” samples and perceives in the ruliad.</p>\n<p>The most common “core workflow” for mathematicians doing pure mathematics is first to imagine what might be true (usually through a process of intuition that feels a bit like making “direct access to the truths of mathematics”)—and then to “work backwards” to try to construct a proof. As a practical matter, though, the vast majority of “mathematics done in the world” doesn’t follow this workflow, and instead just “runs forward”—doing computation. And there’s no reason for at least the innards of that computation to have any “humanized character” to it; it can just involve the raw processes of computation.</p>\n<p>But the traditional pure mathematics workflow in effect depends on <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>using “human-level” steps</a>. Or if, as we described earlier, we think of low-level axiomatic operations as being like molecular dynamics, then it involves operating at a “fluid dynamics” level. </p>\n<p>A century ago efforts to “globally understand mathematics” centered on trying to find common axiomatic foundations for everything. But as different areas of mathematics were explored (and particularly ones like algebraic topology that cut across existing disciplines) it began to seem as if there might also be “top-down” commonalities in mathematics, in effect directly at the “fluid dynamics” level. And within the last few decades, it’s become increasingly common to use ideas from category theory as a general framework for thinking about mathematics at a high level.</p>\n<p>But there’s also been an effort to progressively build up—as an abstract matter—formal “higher category theory”. A notable feature of this has been the appearance of connections to both geometry and mathematical logic—and for us a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#the-view-from-mathematics'>connection to the ruliad</a> and its features. </p>\n<p>The success of category theory has led in the past decade or so to interest in other high-level structural approaches to mathematics. A notable example is homotopy type theory. The basic concept is to characterize mathematical objects not by using axioms to describe properties they should have, but instead to use “types” to say “what the objects are” (for example, “mapping from reals to integers”). Such type theory has the feature that it tends to look much more “immediately computational” than traditional mathematical structures and notation—as well as making explicit proofs and other metamathematical concepts. And in fact questions about types and their equivalences wind up <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/#the-view-from-mathematics'>being very much like</a> the questions we’ve discussed for the multiway systems we’re using as metamodels for mathematics.</p>\n<p>Homotopy type theory can itself be set up as a formal axiomatic system—but with axioms that include what amount to metamathematical statements. A key example is the univalence axiom which essentially states that things that are equivalent can be treated as the same. And now from our point of view here we can see this being essentially a statement of metamathematical coarse graining—and a piece of defining what should be considered “mathematics” on the basis of properties assumed for a mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>When Plato introduced ideal forms and their distinction from the external and internal world the understanding of even the fundamental concept of computation—let alone <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>multicomputation</a> and the ruliad—was still more than two millennia in the future. But now our picture is that everything can in a sense be viewed as part of the world of ideal forms that is the ruliad—and that not only mathematics but also physical reality are in effect just manifestations of these ideal forms.</p>\n<p>But a crucial aspect is how we sample the “ideal forms” of the ruliad. And this is where the “contingent facts” about us as human “observers” enter. The formal axiomatic view of mathematics can be viewed as providing one kind of low-level description of the ruliad. But the point is that this description isn’t aligned with what observers like us perceive—or with what we will successfully be able to view as human-level mathematics. </p>\n<p>A century ago there was a movement to take mathematics (as well, as it happens, as other fields) beyond its origins in what amount to human perceptions of the world. But what we now see is that while there is an underlying “world of ideal forms” embodied in the ruliad that has nothing to do with us humans, mathematics as we humans do it must be associated with the particular sampling we make of that underlying structure.</p>\n<p>And it’s not as if we get to pick that sampling “at will”; the sampling we do is the result of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>fundamental features of us as humans</a>. And an important point is that those fundamental features determine our characteristics both as mathematical observers and as physical observers. And this fact leads to a deep connection between our experience of physics and our definition of mathematics. </p>\n<p>Mathematics historically began as a formal idealization of our human perception of the physical world. Along the way, though, it began to think of itself as a more purely abstract pursuit, separated from both human perception and the physical world. But now, with the general idea of computation, and more specifically with the concept of the ruliad, we can in a sense see what the limit of such abstraction would be. And interesting though it is, what we’re now discovering is that it’s not the thing we call mathematics. And instead, what we call mathematics is something that is subtly but deeply determined by general features of human perception—in fact, essentially the same features that also determine our perception of the physical world.</p>\n<p>The intellectual foundations and justification are different now. But in a sense our view of mathematics has come full circle. And we can now see that mathematics is in fact deeply connected to the physical world and our particular perception of it. And we as humans can do what we call mathematics for basically the same reason that we as humans manage to parse the physical world to the point where we can do science about it.</p>\n<h2 id='implications-for-the-future-of-mathematics'><span>31 | </span>Implications for the Future of Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Having talked a bit about historical context let’s now talk about what the things we’ve discussed here mean for the future of mathematics—both in theory and in practice. </p>\n<p>At a theoretical level we’ve characterized the story of mathematics as being the story of a particular way of exploring the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>ruliad</a>. And from this we might think that in some sense the ultimate limit of mathematics would be to just deal with the ruliad as a whole. But observers like us—at least doing mathematics the way we normally do it—simply can’t do that. And in fact, with the limitations we have as mathematical observers we can inevitably sample only tiny slices of the ruliad.</p>\n<p>But as we’ve discussed, it is exactly this that leads us to experience the kinds of “general laws of mathematics” that we’ve talked about. And it is from these laws that we get a picture of the “large-scale structure of mathematics”—that turns out to be in many ways similar to the picture of the large-scale structure of our physical universe that we get from physics.</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, what corresponds to the coherent structure of physical space is the possibility of doing mathematics in terms of high-level concepts—without always having to drop down to the “atomic” level. Effective uniformity of metamathematical space then leads to the idea of “pure metamathematical motion”, and in effect the possibility of translating at a high level between different areas of mathematics. And what this suggests is that in some sense “all high-level areas of mathematics” should ultimately be connected by “high-level dualities”—some of which have already been seen, but many of which remain to be discovered.</p>\n<p>Thinking about metamathematics in physicalized terms also suggests another phenomenon: essentially an <a href='#gravitational-and-relativistic-effects-in-metamathematics'>analog of gravity for metamathematics</a>. As we discussed earlier, in direct analogy to the way that &#8220;larger densities of activity&#8221; in the spatial hypergraph for physics lead to a deflection in geodesic paths in physical space, so also larger &#8220;entailment density&#8221; in metamathematical space will lead to deflection in geodesic paths in metamathematical space. And when the entailment density gets sufficiently high, it presumably becomes inevitable that these paths will all converge, leading to what one might think of as a &#8220;metamathematical singularity&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the spacetime case, a typical analog would be a place where all geodesics have finite length, or in effect “time stops”. In our view of metamathematics, it corresponds to a situation where “all proofs are finite”—or, in other words, where everything is decidable, and there is no more “fundamental difficulty” left. </p>\n<p>Absent other effects we might imagine that in the physical universe the effects of gravity would eventually lead everything to collapse into black holes. And the analog in metamathematics would be that everything in mathematics would “collapse” into decidable theories. But among the effects not accounted for is continued expansion—or in effect the creation of new physical or metamathematical space, formed in a sense by underlying raw computational processes.</p>\n<p>What will observers like us make of this, though? In statistical mechanics an observer who does coarse graining might perceive the “heat death of the universe”. But at a molecular level there is all sorts of detailed motion that reflects a continued irreducible process of computation. And inevitably there will be an infinite collection of possible “slices of reducibility” to be found in this—just not necessarily ones that align with any of our current capabilities as observers. </p>\n<p>What does this mean for mathematics? Conceivably it might suggest that there’s only so much that can fundamentally be discovered in “high-level mathematics” without in effect “expanding our scope as observers”—or in essence changing our definition of what it is we humans mean by doing mathematics. </p>\n<p>But underneath all this is still raw computation—and the ruliad. And this we know goes on forever, in effect continually generating “irreducible surprises”. But how should we study “raw computation”?</p>\n<p>In essence we want to do unfettered exploration of the computational universe, of the kind I did in <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and that we now call the science of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>. It’s something we can view as more abstract and more fundamental than mathematics—and indeed, as we’ve argued, it’s for example what’s underneath not only mathematics but also physics.</p>\n<p>Ruliology is a rich intellectual activity, important for example as a source of models for many processes in nature and elsewhere. But it’s one where computational irreducibility and undecidability are seen at almost every turn—and it’s not one where we can readily expect “general laws” accessible to observers like us, of the kind we’ve seen in physics, and now see in mathematics.</p>\n<p>We’ve argued that with its foundation in the ruliad mathematics is ultimately based on structures lower level than axiom systems. But given their familiarity from the history of mathematics, it’s convenient to use axiom systems—as we have done here—as a kind of “intermediate-scale metamodel” for mathematics.</p>\n<p>But what is the “workflow” for using axiom systems? One possibility in effect inspired by ruliology is just to systematically construct the entailment cone for an axiom system, progressively generating all possible theorems that the axiom system implies. But while doing this is of great theoretical interest, it typically isn’t something that will in practice reach much in the way of (currently) familiar mathematical results.</p>\n<p>But let’s say one’s thinking about a particular result. A proof of this would correspond to a path within the entailment cone. And the idea of <a href='#relations-to-automated-theorem-proving'>automated theorem proving</a> is to systematically find such a path—which, with a variety of tricks, can usually be done vastly more efficiently than just by enumerating everything in the entailment cone. In practice, though, despite half a century of history, automated theorem proving has seen very little use in mainstream mathematics. Of course it doesn’t help that in typical mathematical work a proof is seen as part of the high-level exposition of ideas—but automated proofs tend to operate at the level of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>“axiomatic machine code”</a> without any connection to human-level narrative.</p>\n<p>But if one doesn’t already know the result one’s trying to prove? Part of the intuition that comes from <em>A New Kind of Science</em> is that there can be “interesting results” that are still simple enough that they can conceivably be found by some kind of explicit search—and then verified by automated theorem proving. But so far as I know, only one significant unexpected result has so far ever been found in this way with automated theorem proving: <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>my 2000 result on the simplest axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>.</p>\n<p>And the fact is that when it comes to using computers for mathematics, the overwhelming fraction of the time they’re used not to construct proofs, but instead to do “forward computations” and “get results” (yes, often with <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/'>Mathematica</a>). Of course, within those forward computations, there are many operations—like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Reduce.html'>Reduce</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SatisfiableQ.html'>SatisfiableQ</a></tt>, <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PrimeQ.html'>PrimeQ</a></tt>, etc.—that essentially work by internally finding proofs, but their output is “just results” not “why-it’s-true explanations”. (<tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>—as its name suggests—is a case where an actual proof is generated.)</p>\n<p>Whether one’s thinking in terms of axioms and proofs, or just in terms of “getting results”, one’s ultimately always dealing with computation. But the key question is how that computation is “packaged”. Is one dealing with arbitrary, raw, low-level constructs, or with something higher level and more “humanized”?</p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, at the lowest level, everything can be represented in terms of the ruliad. But when we do both mathematics and physics what we’re perceiving is not the raw ruliad, but rather just certain high-level features of it. But how should these be represented? Ultimately we need a language that we humans understand, that captures the particular features of the underlying raw computation that we’re interested in.</p>\n<p>From our computational point of view, mathematical notation can be thought of as a rough attempt at this. But the most complete and systematic effort in this direction is the one I’ve worked towards for the past several decades: what’s now the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>full-scale computational language</a> that is the Wolfram Language (and Mathematica).</p>\n<p>Ultimately the Wolfram Language can represent any computation. But the point is to make it easy to represent the computations that people care about: to capture the high-level constructs (whether they’re polynomials, geometrical objects or chemicals) that are part of modern human thinking. </p>\n<p>The <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>process of language design</a> (on which, yes, I’ve spent immense amounts of time) is a curious mixture of art and science, that requires both drilling down to the essence of things, and creatively devising ways to make those things accessible and cognitively convenient for humans. At some level it’s a bit like deciding on words as they might appear in a human language—but it’s something more structured and demanding.</p>\n<p>And it’s our best way of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>representing “high-level” mathematics</a>: mathematics not at the axiomatic (or below) “machine code” level, but instead at the level human mathematicians typically think about it. </p>\n<p>We’ve definitely not “finished the job”, though. Wolfram Language currently has around 7000 built-in primitive constructs, of which at least a <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/#HigherMathematicalComputation'>couple of thousand can be considered “primarily mathematical”</a>. But while the language has long contained constructs for <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AlgebraicNumbers.html'>algebraic numbers</a>, <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/RandomProcesses.html'>random walks</a> and <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/GroupTheory.html'>finite groups</a>, it doesn’t (yet) have built-in constructs for algebraic topology or K-theory. In recent years we’ve been <a href='https://blog.wolfram.com/2016/12/22/the-semantic-representation-of-pure-mathematics/'>slowly adding more kinds of pure-mathematical constructs</a>—but to reach the frontiers of modern human mathematics might require <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>perhaps a thousand more</a>. And to make them useful all of them will have to be carefully and coherently designed.</p>\n<p>The great power of the Wolfram Language comes not only from being able to represent things computationally, but also being able to compute with things, and get results. And it’s one thing to be able to represent some pure mathematical construct—but quite another to be able to broadly compute with it.</p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language in a sense emphasizes the “forward computation” workflow. Another workflow that’s achieved some popularity in recent years is the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07758' target=_blank rel=noopener>proof assistant</a> one—in which one defines a result and then as a human one tries to fill in the steps to create a proof of it, with the computer verifying that the steps correctly fit together. If the steps are low level then what one has is something like typical automated theorem proving—though now being attempted with human effort rather than being done automatically. </p>\n<p>In principle one can build up to much higher-level “steps” in a modular way. But now the problem is essentially the same as in computational language design: to create primitives that are both precise enough to be immediately handled computationally, and “cognitively convenient” enough to be usefully understood by humans. And realistically once one’s done the design (which, after decades of <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/live-ceoing/'>working on such things, I can say is hard</a>), there’s likely to be much more “leverage” to be had by letting the computer just do computations than by expending human effort (even with computer assistance) to put together proofs.</p>\n<p>One might think that a proof would be important in being sure one’s got the right answer. But as we’ve discussed, that’s a complicated concept when one’s dealing with human-level mathematics. If we go to a full axiomatic level it’s very typical that there will be all sorts of pedantic conditions involved. Do we have the “right answer” if underneath we assume that 1/0=0? Or does this not matter at the “fluid dynamics” level of human mathematics? </p>\n<p>One of the great things about <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>computational language</a> is that—at least if it’s written well—it provides a <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/'>clear and succinct specification of things</a>, just like a good “human proof” is supposed to. But computational language has the great advantage that it can be run to create new results—rather than just being used to check something.</p>\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that there’s another potential workflow beyond “compute a result” and “find a proof”. It’s “here’s an object or a set of constraints for creating one; now find interesting facts about this”. Type into <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a> something like <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sin%5E4%28x%29'>sin^4(x)</a> (and, yes, there’s “natural math understanding” needed to translate something like this to precise Wolfram Language). There’s nothing obvious to “compute” here. But instead what Wolfram|Alpha does is to “say interesting things” about this—like what its maximum or its integral over a period is.</p>\n<p>In principle this is a bit like exploring the entailment cone—but with the crucial additional piece of picking out which entailments will be “interesting to humans”. (And implementationally it’s a very deeply constrained exploration.) </p>\n<p>It’s interesting to compare these various workflows with what one can call <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/'>experimental mathematics</a>. Sometimes this term is basically just applied to studying explicit examples of known mathematical results. But the much more powerful concept is to imagine discovering new mathematical results by “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/03/two-hours-of-experimental-mathematics/'>doing experiments</a>”.</p>\n<p>Usually these experiments are not done at the level of axioms, but rather at a considerably higher level (e.g. with things specified using the primitives of Wolfram Language). But the typical pattern is to enumerate a large number of cases and to see what happens—with the most exciting result being the discovery of some unexpected phenomenon, regularity or irregularity. </p>\n<p>This type of approach is in a sense much more general than mathematics: it can be applied to anything computational, or anything described by rules. And indeed it is the core methodology of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology'>ruliology</a>, and what it does to explore the computational universe—and the ruliad.</p>\n<p>One can think of the typical approach in pure mathematics as representing a gradual expansion of the entailment fabric, with humans checking (perhaps with a computer) statements they consider adding. Experimental mathematics effectively strikes out in some “direction” in metamathematical space, potentially jumping far away from the entailment fabric currently within the purview of some mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>And one feature of this—very common in ruliology—is that one may <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p753--undecidability-and-intractability/'>run into undecidability</a>. The “nearby” entailment fabric of the mathematical observer is in a sense “filled in enough” that it doesn’t typically have infinite proof paths of the kind associated with undecidability. But something reached by experimental mathematics has no such guarantee. </p>\n<p>What’s good of course is that experimental mathematics can discover phenomena that are “far away” from existing mathematics. But (like in automated theorem proving) there isn’t necessarily any human-accessible “narrative explanation” (and if there’s undecidability there may be no “finite explanation” at all).</p>\n<p>So how does this all relate to our whole discussion of new ideas about the foundations of mathematics? In the past we might have thought that mathematics must ultimately progress just by working out more and more consequences of particular axioms. But what we’ve argued is that there’s a fundamental infrastructure even far below axiom systems—whose low-level exploration is the subject of ruliology. But the thing we call mathematics is really something higher level. </p>\n<p>Axiom systems are some kind of intermediate modeling layer—a kind of “assembly language” that can be used as a wrapper above the “raw ruliad”. In the end, we’ve argued, the details of this language won’t matter for typical things we call mathematics. But in a sense the situation is very much like in practical computing: we want an “assembly language” that makes it easiest to do the typical high-level things we want. In practical computing that’s often achieved with RISC instruction sets. In mathematics we typically imagine using axiom systems like ZFC. But—as reverse mathematics has tended to indicate—there are probably much more accessible axiom systems that could be used to reach the mathematics we want. (And ultimately even <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--set-theory-and-axioms/'>ZFC is limited</a> in what it can reach.)</p>\n<p>But if we could find such a “RISC” axiom system for mathematics it has the potential to make practical more extensive exploration of the entailment cone. It’s also conceivable—though not guaranteed—that it could be “designed” to be more readily understood by humans. But in the end actual human-level mathematics will typically operate at a level far above it. </p>\n<p>And now the question is whether the “physicalized general laws of mathematics” that we’ve discussed can be used to make conclusions directly about human-level mathematics. We’ve identified a few features—like the very possibility of high-level mathematics, and the expectation of extensive dualities between mathematical fields. And we know that basic commonalities in structural features can be captured by things like category theory. But the question is what kinds of deeper general features can be found, and used.</p>\n<p>In physics our everyday experience immediately makes us think about “large-scale features” far above the level of atoms of space. In mathematics our typical experience so far has been at a lower level. So now the challenge is to think more globally, more metamathematically and, in effect, more like in physics.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, what we call mathematics is what mathematical observers perceive. So if we ask about the future of mathematics we must also ask about the future of mathematical observers.</p>\n<p>If one looks at the history of physics there was already much to understand just on the basis of what we humans could “observe” with our unaided senses. But gradually as more kinds of detectors became available—from microscopes to telescopes to amplifiers and so on—the domain of the physical observer was expanded, and the perceived laws of physics with it. And today, as the practical computational capability of observers increases, we can expect that we’ll gradually see new kinds of physical laws (say associated with hitherto “it’s just random” molecular motion or other features of systems). </p>\n<p>As we’ve discussed above, we can see our characteristics as physical observers as being associated with “experiencing” the ruliad from one particular “vantage point” in rulial space (just as we “experience” physical space from one particular vantage point in physical space). Putative “aliens” might experience the ruliad from a different vantage point in rulial space—leading them to have laws of physics utterly incoherent with our own. But as our technology and ways of thinking progress, we can expect that we’ll gradually be able to expand our “presence” in rulial space (just as we do with spacecraft and telescopes in physical space). And so we’ll be able to “experience” different laws of physics.</p>\n<p><a name='paramathematics'></a>We can expect the story to be very similar for mathematics. We have “experienced” mathematics from a certain vantage point in the ruliad. Putative aliens might experience it from another point, and build their own “paramathematics” utterly incoherent with our mathematics. The “natural evolution” of our mathematics corresponds to a gradual expansion in the entailment fabric, and in a sense a gradual spreading in rulial space. Experimental mathematics has the potential to launch a kind of “metamathematical space probe” which can discover quite different mathematics. At first, though, this will tend to be a piece of “raw ruliology”. But, if pursued, it potentially points the way to a kind of “colonization of rulial space” that will gradually expand the domain of the mathematical observer.</p>\n<p>The physicalized general laws of mathematics we’ve discussed here are based on features of current mathematical observers (which in turn are highly based on current physical observers). What these laws would be like with “enhanced” mathematical observers we don’t yet know. </p>\n<p>Mathematics as it is today is a great example of the “humanization of raw computation”. Two other examples are theoretical physics and computational language. And in all cases there is the potential to gradually expand our scope as observers. It’ll no doubt be a mixture of technology and methods along with expanded cognitive frameworks and understanding. We can use ruliology—or experimental mathematics—to “jump out” into the raw ruliad. But most of what we’ll see is “non-humanized” computational irreducibility. </p>\n<p>But perhaps somewhere there’ll be another slice of computational reducibility: a different “island” on which “alien” general laws can be built. But for now we exist on our current “island” of reducibility. And on this island we see the particular kinds of general laws that we’ve discussed. We saw them first in physics. But there <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/' target=_blank rel=noopener>we discovered that they could emerge</a> quite generically from a <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2021/10/multicomputation-with-numbers-the-case-of-simple-multiway-systems' target=_blank rel=noopener>lower-level computational structure</a>—and ultimately from the very general structure that we call the ruliad. And now, as we’ve discussed here, we realize that the thing we call mathematics is actually based on exactly the same foundations—with the result that it should show the same kinds of general laws.</p>\n<p>It’s a rather different view of mathematics—and its foundations—than we’ve been able to form before. But the deep connection with physics that we’ve discussed allows us to now have a physicalized view of metamathematics, which informs both what mathematics really is now, and what the future can hold for the remarkable pursuit that we call mathematics. </p>\n<style type='text/css'>\n\t#blog #content .post_content h2#some-personal-history-the-evolution-of-these-ideas {\n    border-top: solid 1px #ccc;\n    padding-top: 35px;\n    margin-top: 25px;\n</style>\n<h2 id='some-personal-history-the-evolution-of-these-ideas'>Some Personal History: The Evolution of These Ideas</h2>\n<p>It’s been a long personal journey to get to the ideas described here—stretching back nearly 45 years. Parts have been quite direct, steadily building over the course of time. But other parts have been surprising—even shocking. And to get to where we are now has required me to rethink some very long-held assumptions, and adopt what I had believed was a rather different way of thinking—even though, ironically, I’ve realized in the end that many aspects of this way of thinking pretty much mirror what I’ve done all along at a practical and technological level.</p>\n<p>Back in the late 1970s as a young theoretical physicist I had discovered the “secret weapon” of using computers to do mathematical calculations. By 1979 I had outgrown existing systems and <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2013/06/there-was-a-time-before-mathematica/'>decided to build my own</a>. But what should its foundations be? A key goal was to represent the processes of mathematics in a computational way. I thought about the methods I’d found effective in practice. I studied the history of mathematical logic. And in the end I came up with what seemed to me at the time the most obvious and direct approach: that everything should be based on transformations for symbolic expressions.</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure this was actually a good general approach to computation of all kinds—and the system we released in 1981 was named <a href='https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/34/2020/07/smp-reference-manual.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>SMP (“Symbolic Manipulation Program”)</a> to reflect this generality. History has indeed borne out the strength of the symbolic expression paradigm—and it’s from that we’ve been able to build the huge tower of technology that is the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/'>modern Wolfram Language</a>. But all along mathematics has been an important use case—and in effect we’ve now seen four decades of validation that the core idea of transformations on symbolic expressions is a good metamodel of mathematics.</p>\n<p>When <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/scrapbook/'>Mathematica was first released in 1988</a> we called it “A System for Doing Mathematics by Computer”, where by “doing mathematics” we meant doing computations in mathematics and getting results. People soon did all sorts of experiments on using Mathematica to create and present proofs. But the overwhelming majority of actual usage was for directly computing results—and almost nobody seemed interested in seeing the inner workings, presented as a proof or otherwise. </p>\n<p>But in the 1980s I had <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>started my work on exploring the computational universe of simple programs</a> like cellular automata. And doing this was all about looking at the ongoing behavior of systems—or in effect the (often computationally irreducible) history of computations. And even though I sometimes talked about using my computational methods to do “experimental mathematics”, I don’t think I particularly thought about the actual progress of the computations I was studying as being like mathematical processes or proofs.</p>\n<p>In 1991 I started working on what became <em><a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/'>A New Kind of Science</a></em>, and in doing so I tried to systematically study possible forms of computational processes—and I was soon led to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p88--sequential-substitution-systems/'>substitution systems</a> and <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p102--symbolic-systems/'>symbolic systems</a> which I viewed in their different ways as being minimal idealizations of what would become Wolfram Language, as well as to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway systems</a>. There were some areas to which I was pretty sure the methods of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> would apply. Three that I wasn’t sure about were biology, physics and mathematics.</p>\n<p>But by the late 1990s I had worked out quite a bit about the first two, and started looking at mathematics. I knew that Mathematica and what would become Wolfram Language were good representations of “practical mathematics”. But I assumed that to understand the foundations of mathematics I should look at the traditional low-level representation of mathematics: axiom systems. </p>\n<p>And in doing this I was soon able to simplify to multiway systems—with proofs being paths:</p>\n<p><a alt=\"Page 775\" title=\"Page 775\" href=\"https://wolframscience.com/nks/p775--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/\"><img alt=\"Page 775—click to enlarge\" title=\"Page 775\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/nks-775-2xA.png\" style=\"width:100%;max-width: 309px;height:auto;\"></a><a alt=\"Page 777\" title=\"Page 777\" href=\"https://wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/\"><img alt=\"Page 777—click to enlarge\" title=\"Page 777\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/nks-777-2xA.png\" style=\"width:100%;max-width: 311px;height:auto;\"></a></p>\n<p>I had long wondered what the detailed relationships between things like my idea of <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/'>computational irreducibility</a> and earlier results in mathematical logic were. And I was pleased at how well many things could be clarified—and explicitly illustrated—by thinking in terms of multiway systems. </p>\n<p>My experience in exploring simple programs in general had led to the conclusion that computational irreducibility and therefore undecidability were quite ubiquitous. So I <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p793--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>considered it quite a mystery</a> why undecidability seemed so rare in the mathematics that mathematicians typically did. I suspected that in fact undecidability was lurking close at hand—and I got some evidence of that by doing experimental mathematics. But why weren’t mathematicians running into this more? I came to suspect that it had something to do with the history of mathematics, and with the idea that mathematics had tended to expand its subject matter by asking “How can this be generalized while still having such-and-such a theorem be true?”</p>\n<p>But I also wondered about the particular axiom systems that had historically been used for mathematics. They all fit easily on a couple of pages. But why these and not others? Following my general “ruliological” approach of exploring all possible systems I started just <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p804--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>enumerating possible axiom systems</a>—and soon found out that many of them had rich and complicated implications. </p>\n<p>But where among these possible systems did the axiom systems historically used in mathematics lie? I did searches, and at about the 50,000th axiom was able to <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--searching-for-logic-axioms/'>find the simplest axiom system for Boolean algebra</a>. Proving that it was correct gave me my first serious <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p811--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>experience with automated theorem proving</a>.</p>\n<p>But what kind of a thing was the proof? I made some attempt to understand it, but it was clear that it <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>wasn&#8217;t something a human could readily understand</a>—and reading it felt a bit like trying to read machine code. I recognized that the problem was in a sense a lack of “human connection points”—for example of intermediate lemmas that (like words in a human language) had a contextualized significance. I wondered about how one could find lemmas that “humans would care about”? And I was surprised to discover that at least for the “named theorems” of Boolean algebra a <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p817--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>simple criterion could reproduce them</a>. </p>\n<p>Quite a few years went by. Off and on I thought about two ultimately related issues. One was how to represent the <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Trace.html'>execution histories</a> of Wolfram Language programs. And the other was how to represent proofs. In both cases there seemed to be all sorts of detail, and it seemed difficult to have a structure that would capture what would be needed for further computation—or any kind of general understanding.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in 2009, we released <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/'>Wolfram|Alpha</a>. One of its features was that it had <a href='https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/pro-features/step-by-step-solutions/'>“step-by-step” math computations</a>. But these weren’t “general proofs”: rather they were narratives synthesized in very specific ways for human readers. Still, a core concept in Wolfram|Alpha—and the Wolfram Language—is the idea of integrating in knowledge about as many things as possible in the world. We’d done this for cities and movies and lattices and animals and much more. And I thought about doing it for mathematical theorems as well.</p>\n<p>We did a <a href='https://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/FinalReport.pdf' target=_blank rel=noopener>pilot project</a>—on theorems about continued fractions. We trawled through the mathematical literature assessing the difficulty of extending the “natural math understanding” we’d built for Wolfram|Alpha. I <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2014/08/computational-knowledge-and-the-future-of-pure-mathematics/'>imagined a workflow</a> which would mix automated theorem generation with theorem search—in which one would define a mathematical scenario, then say “tell me interesting facts about this”. And in 2014 we set about engaging the mathematical community in a <a href='https://www.wolframfoundation.org/programs/computable-archive-of-mathematics.html' target=_blank rel=noopener>large-scale curation effort</a> to formalize the theorems of mathematics. But try as we might, only people already involved in math formalization seemed to care; with few exceptions working mathematicians just didn’t seem to consider it relevant to what they did.</p>\n<p>We continued, however, to push slowly forward. We worked with proof assistant developers. We curated various kinds of mathematical structures (like <a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/entity/FunctionSpace.html'>function spaces</a>). I had estimated that we’d need more than a thousand new Wolfram Language functions to cover “modern pure mathematics”, but without a clear market we couldn’t motivate the huge design (let alone implementation) effort that would be needed—though, partly in a nod to the intellectual origins of mathematics, we did for example do a project that has succeeded in finally <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/language/12/plane-geometry/euclids-elements.html'>making Euclid-style geometry computable</a>.</p>\n<p>Then in the latter part of the 2010s a couple more “proof-related” things happened. Back in 2002 we’d started using equational logic automated theorem proving to get results in functions like <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FullSimplify.html'>FullSimplify</a></tt>. But we hadn’t figured out how to present the proofs that were generated. In 2018 we finally introduced <tt><a href='https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindEquationalProof.html'>FindEquationalProof</a></tt>—allowing programmatic access to proofs, and making it feasible for me to explore collections of proofs in bulk.</p>\n<p>I had for decades been interested in what I’ve called “<a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/'>symbolic discourse language</a>”: the extension of the idea of computational language to “everyday discourse”—and to the kind of thing one might want for example to express in legal contracts. And between this and our involvement in the idea of computational contracts, and things like <a href='https://wolframblockchainlabs.com/'>blockchain technology</a>, I started exploring questions of <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/a-short-talk-on-ai-ethics/'>AI ethics</a> and “constitutions”. At this point we’d also started to introduce <a href='https://www.wolfram.com/featureset/machine-learning/'>machine-learning-based functions</a> into the Wolfram Language. And—with my <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p810--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>“human incomprehensible” Boolean algebra proof</a> as “empirical data”—I started <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2018/11/logic-explainability-and-the-future-of-understanding/'>exploring general questions of explainability</a>, and in effect proof.</p>\n<p>And not long after that came the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/'>surprise breakthrough of our Physics Project</a>. Extending my ideas from the 1990s about computational foundations for fundamental physics it suddenly became possible finally to understand the underlying origins of the main known laws of physics. And core to this effort—and particularly to the <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics'>understanding of quantum mechanics</a>—were <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/'>multiway systems</a>.</p>\n<p>At first we just used the knowledge that multiway systems <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p777--implications-for-mathematics-and-its-foundations/'>could also represent axiomatic mathematics</a> and proofs to provide analogies for our thinking about physics (“quantum observers might in effect be doing critical-pair completions”, “causal graphs are like higher categories”, etc.) But then we started wondering whether the phenomenon of the emergence that we’d seen for the familiar laws of physics might also affect mathematics—and whether it could give us something like a “bulk” version of metamathematics.</p>\n<p>I had long studied the transition from discrete “computational” elements to “bulk” behavior, first following my interest in the Second Law of thermodynamics, which stretched <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p17--the-personal-story-of-the-science-in-this-book/'>all the way back to age 12 in 1972</a>, then following my work on <a href='https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-8-4--history-of-cellular-automaton-fluids/'>cellular automaton fluids in the mid-1980s</a>, and now with the emergence of physical space from underlying hypergraphs in our Physics Project. But what might “bulk” metamathematics be like? </p>\n<p>One feature of our Physics Project—in fact shared with thermodynamics—is that certain aspects of its observed behavior depend very little on the details of its components. But what did they depend on? We realized that it all had to do with the observer—and their interaction (according to what <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/'>I&#8217;ve described as the 4th paradigm for science</a>) with the general “multicomputational” processes going on underneath. For physics we had some idea what characteristics an “observer like us” might have (and actually they seemed to be <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>closely related to our notion of consciousness</a>). But what might a “mathematical observer” be like?</p>\n<p>In its original framing we talked about our Physics Project as being about “finding the rule for the universe”. But right around the time we launched the project we realized that that wasn’t really the right characterization. And we started talking about <a href='https://www.wolframphysics.org/bulletins/2020/06/exploring-rulial-space-the-case-of-turing-machines/' target=_blank rel=noopener>rulial multiway systems</a> that instead “run every rule”—but in which an observer perceives only some small slice, that in particular can show emergent laws of physics.</p>\n<p>But what is this “run every rule” structure? In the end it’s something very fundamental: the entangled limit of all possible computations—that I call <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/'>the ruliad</a>. The ruliad basically depends on nothing: it’s unique and its structure is a matter of formal necessity. So in a sense the ruliad “necessarily exists”—and, <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/'>I argued, so must our universe</a>. </p>\n<p>But we can think of the ruliad not only as the foundation for physics, but also as the foundation for mathematics. And so, I concluded, if we believe that the physical universe exists, then we must <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/04/why-does-the-universe-exist-some-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/#the-relation-to-mathematics'>conclude—a bit like Plato—that mathematics exists too</a>.</p>\n<p>But how did all this relate to axiom systems and ideas about metamathematics? I had two additional pieces of input from the latter half of 2020. First, following up on a note in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I had done an <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/09/the-empirical-metamathematics-of-euclid-and-beyond/'>extensive study of the “empirical metamathematics”</a> of the network of the theorems in Euclid, and in a couple of math formalization systems. And second, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of their invention essentially as “primitives for mathematics”, I had done an extensive ruliological and other <a href='https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/combinators-a-centennial-view/'>study of combinators</a>.</p>\n<p>I <a href='https://livestreams.stephenwolfram.com/category/physics-project-working-sessions'>began to work</a> on this current piece in the fall of 2020, but felt there was something I was missing. Yes, I could study axiom systems using the formalism of our Physics Project. But was this really getting at the essence of mathematics? I had long assumed that axiom systems really were the “raw material” of mathematics—even though I’d long gotten signals they weren’t really a good representation of how serious, aesthetically oriented pure mathematicians thought about things.</p>\n<p>In our Physics Project we’d always had as a target to reproduce the known laws of physics. But what should the target be in understanding the foundations of mathematics? It always seemed like it had to revolve around axiom systems and processes of proof. And it felt like validation when it became clear that the same concepts of “substitution rules applied to expressions” seemed to span my earliest efforts to make math computational, the underlying structure of our Physics Project, and “metamodels” of axiom systems. </p>\n<p>But somehow the ruliad—and the idea that if physics exists so must math—made me realize that this wasn’t ultimately the right level of description. And that axioms were some kind of intermediate level, between the “raw ruliad”, and the “humanized” level at which pure mathematics is normally done. At first I found this hard to accept; not only had axiom systems dominated thinking about the foundations of mathematics for more than a century, but they also seemed to fit so perfectly into my personal “symbolic rules” paradigm.</p>\n<p>But gradually I got convinced that, yes, I had been wrong all this time—and that axiom systems were in many respects missing the point. The true foundation is the ruliad, and axiom systems are a rather-hard-to-work-with “machine-code-like” description below the inevitable general “physicalized laws of metamathematics” that emerge—and that imply that for observers like us there’s a fundamentally higher-level approach to mathematics. </p>\n<p>At first I thought this was incompatible with my general computational view of things. But then I realized: “No, quite the opposite!” All these years I’ve been building the Wolfram Language precisely to connect “at a human level” with computational processes—and with mathematics. Yes, it can represent and deal with axiom systems. But it’s never felt particularly natural. And it’s because they’re at an awkward level—neither at the level of the raw ruliad and raw computation, nor at the level where we as humans define mathematics.</p>\n<p>But now, I think, we begin to get some clarity on just what this thing we call mathematics really is. What I’ve done here is just a beginning. But between its explicit computational examples and its conceptual arguments I feel it’s pointing the way to a broad and incredibly fertile new understanding that—even though I didn’t see it coming—I’m very excited is now here. </p>\n<h2 id='notes-and-thanks' style='font-size:1.2rem'>Notes &#038; Thanks</h2>\n<p style='font-size:90%'>For more than 25 years Elise Cawley has been telling me her thematic (and rather Platonic) view of the foundations of mathematics—and that basing everything on constructed axiom systems is a piece of modernism that misses the point.

Ça me parait impossible et je suis de ceux qui pensent que Twitter a encore une belle et longue vie devant lui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez exporté vos données Twitter, vous avez dû remarquer que vous pouvez consulter tout ça au travers d&rsquo;une page HTML fournie dans l&rsquo;archive. Mais celle-ci présente plusieurs problèmes. Par exemple, si vous cliquez sur l&rsquo;une des images contenues dans un tweet, vous êtes renvoyé vers le site de Twitter. Ce qui est complètement con si demain votre compte est supprimé ou que Twitter disparait.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131709\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq-300x146.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-nmq-768x374.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Comment télécharger une archive de vos données Twitter ?</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme les tweets sont archivés en JSON, il est compliqué de simplement les copier-coller pour les mettre ailleurs. Même les images fournies ne sont pas exactement identiques à celles que vous avez envoyées. Elles sont étrangement plus petites. C&rsquo;est dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant les DM, même s&rsquo;ils sont présents dans l&rsquo;archive, on ne peut pas savoir qui les a envoyés puisque les noms des émetteurs ont été retirés de l&rsquo;archive. Enfin, les liens inclus dans les messages ne sont pas en clair, mais sont raccourcis. Donc impossible de savoir de quoi ça cause sans cliquer dessus. Et surtout, si un jour Twitter retire son domaine lié aux URLs raccourcies, et bien plus aucun de ces liens ne fonctionnera.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1495201034\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Tous ces petits détails ont incité Tim Hutton et ses amis à agir en proposant un script baptisé Twitter Archive Parser qui « répare » tous ces défauts. En effet, une fois lancé comme ceci sur votre archive&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python parser.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le script se charge alors de convertir tous vos tweets en markdown et HTML en y intégrant les bonnes images (dans leur taille d&rsquo;origine), les vidéos et les liens intégrés. Toutes les URLs raccourcies t.co sont ainsi remplacées par les vrais liens et les images récupérées sont stockées dans un dossier spécifique pour que vous puissiez ensuite les utiliser ou les stocker ailleurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131713\" width=\"351\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54.webp 635w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/supermeme_17h7_54-254x300.webp 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si des pseudos sont absents de l&rsquo;archive, ce parser est également capable de retrouver tous ces identifiants manquants directement depuis Twitter.com pour les réintégrer dans l&rsquo;archive. Les DMs sont également convertis en markdown avec leurs médias, leurs liens en clair et bien sûr le pseudo des gens qui vous les ont envoyés.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, l&rsquo;outil récupère également une liste de vos followers et de vos followings ce qui peut également servir pour d&rsquo;autres choses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si le script pour intéresse, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser\" target=\"_blank\">son code est sur Github ainsi que les explications techniques pour le lancer</a>.</p>\n",

Vous installez ntfy sur <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a> (<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">F-Droid</a>) ou <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS</a> et une fois que c&rsquo;est fait, vous choisissez un « topic » qui est un genre de clé. Cette clé est publique donc créez quelque chose de random et assez long pour que personne ne puisse la deviner. Autrement, quelqu&rsquo;un pourra s&rsquo;amuser à vous envoyer des notifications. Pour l&rsquo;exemple, je vais choisir « korben1234 »</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"338\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed.webp 338w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/unnamed-135x300.webp 135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, il y a plus qu&rsquo;à balancer la notification via Curl comme ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>curl -d \"Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀\" ntfy.sh/korben1234</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>En Python, ça donnerait ça : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>requests.post(\"https://ntfy.sh/korben1234\",\n    data=\"Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀\".encode(encoding='utf-8'))</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1035933728\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>En JavaScript : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>fetch('https://ntfy.sh/korben1234', {\n    method: 'POST', // PUT works too\n    body: 'Sauvegarde terminée !! 😀'\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est aussi simple que ça, avec un simple POST HTTP, vous pouvez recevoir ces petites alertes bien pratiques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voici une démo en vidéo : </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-prise-en-charge-des-contenus-embarques wp-block-embed-prise-en-charge-des-contenus-embarques\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-131698-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4\">https://docs.ntfy.sh/static/img/android-video-overview.mp4</a></video></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez personnaliser les entêtes du message, mettre une icône, joindre une image, mettre un titre et bien d&rsquo;autres choses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est le genre de petit service qui n&rsquo;a l&rsquo;air de rien, mais qui fait des miracles et sait rapidement se rendre indispensable. Ce qui est cool avec ntfy, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez <a href=\"https://docs.ntfy.sh/install/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">l&rsquo;héberger vous-même</a> puisque le projet est open source.

La première, c&rsquo;est un clone de Daisy Disk (logiciel payant) qui vous permet de débusquer les fichiers les plus gros qui trainent sur votre ordinateur. Si vous avez de vieux films, de gros zip ou des programmes d&rsquo;install volumineux, celui-ci saura les retrouver et vous pourrez les dégager d&rsquo;un simple clic.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131682\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-c2i-2-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>La seconde fonctionnalité vous permettra de partir à la chasse de tous les fichiers que vous avez en double. De quoi dégraisser le Willy sans douleur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131685\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cln-2-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Enfin, la dernière fonctionnalité nommée « Organizer » va vous permettre de faire le tri dans un répertoire en passant très rapidement en revue tout ce qui s&rsquo;y trouve pour le supprimer ou le classer dans des répertoires. Cette fonctionnalité est très utile si vous êtes comme moi et que vous stockez des centaines de fichiers dans des dossiers sans vraiment savoir ce qu&rsquo;il y a dedans. Vous pourrez facilement identifier les fichiers que vous n&rsquo;avez pas utilisés depuis longtemps et les supprimer pour gagner de l&rsquo;espace sur votre disque dur.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131686\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0-300x188.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221201-cb0-768x480.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme je le disais, Shorui est gratuit et c&rsquo;est vraiment pratique !

Il nous explique les règles, le déroulement, on se déplace sur une carte et à chaque arrêt, on va pouvoir modifier son deck (ajouts, modifications de cartes, etc.) ou combattre avec. Si l&rsquo;on perd, on recommence à zéro. Enfin pas totalement, car on débloque quand même des éléments qui vont rester d&rsquo;une partie à l&rsquo;autre. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-90183500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Au niveau du jeu en lui-même, le système ressemble à ce qu&rsquo;on peut connaître chez <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/fr-fr\" target=\"_blank\">Hearthstone</a>, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/fr\" target=\"_blank\">Magic the Gathering</a>, etc. mais bien sûr avec des subtilités qui lui sont propres (par exemple, il faut sacrifier une carte pour pouvoir en jouer une autre !

Pourtant il n&rsquo;est pas exempt de défauts, on va en parler, mais disons que le hérisson bleu n&rsquo;avait jamais réussi à me convaincre totalement depuis son passage à la troisième dimension. Certains titres étaient plutôt réussis (les Sonic Adventure, Generations, Colours, ou même Secrets Rings si si) mais j&rsquo;étais loin d&rsquo;y prendre autant de plaisir que sur Megadrive, ou plus récemment sur <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QcnqB1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sonic Mania</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ça démarrait plutôt mal : des environnements « réalistes » un peu ternes et vides, des ennemis au design triste et grisâtre, un aspect sonore très épuré avec de faux airs de <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3icYk8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breath of the Wild</a>, des structures (rampes, loopings, ressorts…) qui semblent flotter dans le ciel… Bref, pas très envie d&rsquo;y jouer…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132059\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">La magie opère !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pourtant, manette en main, ça fonctionne !

Par exemple, résoudre une énigme, réaliser un défi trouvé en chemin, entrer dans le cyberespace et faire la course dans un niveau « classique », se caler une <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NZMTMPZULU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">session de pêche avec Big The Cat</a>, dégommer un mini-boss… En faisant tout ça, on va obtenir des clefs, qui nous permettent de débloquer les <em>Chaos Emeralds</em>, qui nous permettent ensuite d&rsquo;affronter le boss de l&rsquo;île en mode Super Sonic ! 🔥</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132060\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Chaque combat demande une approche différente</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est simple mais sympa à suivre, les répliques sont bien écrites, on retrouve bien la personnalité de nos héros favoris, d&rsquo;ailleurs, bravo à l&rsquo;équipe de doublage car la version française est chouette ! Aussi, les musiques sont super variées, y a quelques titres vraiment entrainants. 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On déplore de rares soucis de maniabilité, et certaines phases de jeu frustrantes (le flipper par exemple…) qui entachent un peu l&rsquo;expérience. Aussi, les graphismes sur la version Switch sont un peu à la ramasse, c&rsquo;est parfois moche. Sur PC et consoles <em>nextgen</em>, le résultat est beaucoup plus agréable voire franchement joli, même si les îles restent trop vides et ternes à mon goût. J&rsquo;espère que dans une future suite, ils sauront nous proposer des mondes plus colorés et plus vivants !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Sonic-Frontiers-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Les niveaux du cyberespace sont chatoyants, eux !</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Il n&#8217;empêche que c&rsquo;est un jeu vraiment agréable, pas prise de tête, qui nous propose du fun immédiat, une très bonne durée de vie… Et d&rsquo;ailleurs, des DLCs gratuits vont sortir tout au long de l&rsquo;année avec notamment de nouveaux personnages jouables (Tails, Amy Rose&#8230; &amp; Knuckles). 😉 Alors malgré ses défauts je ne peux que vous conseiller la dernière aventure de mon hérisson favori !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Acheter Sonic Frontiers sur <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jLRYgR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GeFGoz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 4</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ieloUf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 5</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GdOvPw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox Series S</a></h2>\n",

Apparue en 2009 sur les consoles <em>nextgen</em> de l&rsquo;époque, la licence est devenue une exclusivité Nintendo en 2014 avec la sortie de la première suite sur WiiU.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Bayonetta 3 – La sorcière en action (Nintendo Switch)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHt6drrs-Ww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Il aura fallu attendre 8 ans, rien que ça, pour <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q7vYJr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">la retrouver sur Switch</a> afin de dégommer les anges avec style et cheveux. Parce que voilà, si vous ne le saviez pas, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q7vYJr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bayonetta</a> est une sorcière qui utilise ses cheveux pour invoquer toutes sortes de choses, principalement des démons, mais aussi ses vêtements&#8230; C&rsquo;est pour ça que parfois elle est à moitié à poil. 😅 Rien de choquant je vous rassure, mais ça peut être un peu gênant si quelqu&rsquo;un vous regarde jouer par-dessus l&rsquo;épaule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un élément parmi d&rsquo;autres qui caractérisent cette ambiance complètement barrée, baroque, <em>over the top</em> : le scénario, lui aussi, part dans toutes les directions. C&rsquo;est vraiment fun, inattendu, appuyé par une mise en scène extrêmement généreuse. Des villes entières sont détruites, on se balade dans le multivers, on rencontre de nouveaux personnages, et aussi de nouveaux <em>gameplays</em> : l&rsquo;expérience est extrêmement variée !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132038\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Contrairement aux apparences, l&rsquo;action reste super lisible</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On reste sur une base de <em>beat&#8217;em all</em> / <em>hack&rsquo;n&rsquo;slash</em>, avec des combos et un système de <em>scoring</em> poussé. Si le jeu est facile à prendre en main, maîtriser les subtilités et enchaîner les platines ne sera pas une mince affaire ! Il y a pas mal de coups, d&rsquo;armes, de démons à débloquer, ce qui fait qu&rsquo;on découvre toujours de nouvelles choses, on enchaîne les combats sans se lasser. Les phases d&rsquo;explorations donnent envie de tout découvrir, y a plein de choses à trouver, bref, sur le contenu là aussi c&rsquo;est très généreux.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1243728482\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Mon niveau préféré se déroule en plein Paris, ambiance post-apo : sous une lune rouge on tabasse un gros monstre sur le toit de l&rsquo;arc de triomphe, puis on est poursuivi par une horde de flics zombifiés qui se mettent à danser façon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thriller</a>, pour finir avec un hommage au <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cinqui%C3%A8me_%C3%89l%C3%A9ment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cinquième Élément</a> (preuve de bon goût car il s&rsquo;agit du meilleur film du monde, non ?)… Ce n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;un petit aperçu de ce qui vous attend !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132039\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2023/01/Bayonetta-3-3.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Viola, nouveau personnage jouable, propose un gameplay plus agressif</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore une fois (et c&rsquo;est pour ça que je vous en parle), il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un titre que j&rsquo;ai beaucoup apprécié. Tout est fun et débile, le contenu est gargantuesque, la durée de vie est conséquente, le <em>gameplay</em> est doté d&rsquo;une profondeur saisissante.

Ainsi, vous pourrez récupérer une image PNG de la zone, convertir des coordonnées GPS, lancer une recherche Flickr ou Twitter sur la zone ciblée, ouvrir un éditeur GPX, calculer des distances entre deux points&#8230;et ainsi de suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors comment ça s&rsquo;utilise ? Et bien tout d&rsquo;abord, ajoutez un signet (bookmarklet) à votre navigateur en faisant glisser le lien suivant vers votre barre de signets : <a href=\"//tankaru.github.io/OpenSwitchMapsWeb/index.html#'+location.href;})();\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenSwitchMaps Web</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou en ajoutant la fonction suivant dans un bookmark :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>JavaScript:(function(){ window.location.href='https://tankaru.github.io/OpenSwitchMapsWeb/index.html#'+location.href;})();</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, ouvrez Google Maps ou un équivalent puis cliquez sur le bookmark. Et voilà, vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à choisir le service qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est super intéressant et pratique si vous interagissez souvent avec des services de cartographie et je suis certain que vous allez découvrir plein de services cools.</p>\n",

En effet, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarovaya_law#:~:text=The%20Yarovaya%20law%20(in%20Russian,terror%20and%20public%20safety%20measures.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">depuis 2016, la Russie oblige les prestataires Telecom</a> à conserver tous le contenu des appels audio, les données, les images et les messages textes qui seraient présents sur des serveurs localisés en Russie, ainsi que les métadonnées et cela pour 6 mois. Toujours d&rsquo;après cette loi, les réseaux sociaux ou logiciels de messagerie qui utilisent du chiffrement sont également forcés de conserver un accès aux communications chiffrées pour le FSB.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131601\" width=\"602\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Manu23_Vladimir_Putin_spying_with_binoculars_dda95857-9532-4d2d-926b-0559718d64ea-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;objectif avec <a href=\"https://spybuster.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SpyBuster</strong></a> est donc de détecter les logiciels qui auraient des connexions avec des serveurs russes.

D&rsquo;ailleurs, ce qui serait cool, c&rsquo;est que MacPaw étende ce logiciel à d&rsquo;autres pays sympathiques comme la Chine ou les États-Unis qui eux aussi ne se privent pas de piller les données personnelles des internautes.

J&rsquo;en ai déjà parlé plusieurs fois sur le site et selon différents angles : <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">faire respecter vos droits RGPD</a>, <a href=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/data-brokers-incogni.html\">lutter contre les data brokers</a>, faire effacer ses données personnelles, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais l&rsquo;outil a aussi une bonne raison d&rsquo;exister pour d&rsquo;autres problèmes annexes que l&rsquo;on peut rencontrer au cas par cas. Moins fréquents que ceux déjà cités, mais qui existe malgré tout. C&rsquo;est le cas par exemple des arnaques au CPF, ou Compte Professionnel de Formation. Arnaques qui sont en constante augmentation depuis plusieurs années, jusqu&rsquo;à représenter presque&nbsp;45 millions d&rsquo;euros en 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"267\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/14i-incognicpf\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Comme vous le savez, en France et depuis 2015, chaque personne active professionnellement&nbsp;recevait chaque année un crédit d&rsquo;heures donnant droit à suivre des formations. Sauf que depuis 2019 ce crédit d&rsquo;heures a été remplacé par de la moula, chaque travailleur&nbsp;reçoit sur&nbsp;un compte&nbsp;une certaine somme à dépenser « comme il veut ». Pas en frais de restaurant ou en vacances au soleil, calmez-vous hein, mais disons que chacun peut maintenant choisir le type de service qu&rsquo;il veut utiliser avec plus de latitude (formation en ligne, etc.). Plus de 38 millions de français reçoivent ainsi plusieurs centaines d&rsquo;euros chaque année, ça fait de belles sommes. Et qui dit pognon à se faire, dit vautours.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"488\" height=\"275\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/12huzxtUKCLVTy/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Des gens à plumer ? I&rsquo;m in.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sont donc apparus des escrocs qui ont commencé à se faire passer pour des organismes ou centres de formation officiels et qui cherchent à récupérer les fonds disponibles. Vous commencez donc à recevoir des mails/SMS/appels dans lesquels on va soit vous proposer une fausse formation (souvent assez cher), soit vous demander de vous connecter à votre compte formation via un lien qu&rsquo;ils vous fournissent (et à travers lequel ils vont être capable de voler vos identifiants).&nbsp;Certains allant même jusqu&rsquo;à vous suivre sur les réseaux sociaux pour vous démarcher. Et une fois que vous leur avez&nbsp;envoyé votre crédit,&nbsp;ils vont disparaitre dans la nature. En récupérant au passage&nbsp;vos informations personnelles qui pourront éventuellement leur servir également (revente à des data brokers, usurpation d&rsquo;identité, vol de mot de passe, etc.). Pas de gaspillage ma bonne dame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;ailleurs un petit rappel : vos droits à la formation n&rsquo;ont pas de limite maximale d&rsquo;utilisation, vous pouvez les utiliser quand vous voulez (dans 6 mois ou dans 10 ans). Avant de payer une formation quelconque, prenez le temps de vérifier qu&rsquo;elle est dans les clous, reconnue et validée. Ne vous contentez pas d&rsquo;une mention sur leur site web éventuel. Cela arrive plus souvent que vous ne le pensez, plusieurs milliers de travailleurs se font avoir chaque année. Si cela a été votre cas, vous pouvez le <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.moncompteformation.gouv.fr/espace-public/comment-signaler-une-escroquerie-sur-mon-compte-formation\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.moncompteformation.gouv.fr/espace-public/comment-signaler-une-escroquerie-sur-mon-compte-formation\" target=\"_blank\">signaler ici</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation.jpg\" alt=\"Mon compte formation\" class=\"wp-image-131930\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/mon-compte-formation-300x74.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Même si une loi&nbsp;devrait être mise en place bientôt pour réguler un peu tout ça (interdiction de démarchage abusif, référencement des organismes, etc.), il n&rsquo;en reste pas moins que vous avez des armes à votre disposition dès aujourd&rsquo;hui, <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dont Incogni</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avec Incogni, vous avez la possibilité de contrôler les informations personnelles qui sont accessibles sur le web. Vous pouvez ainsi demander aux services qui ont stocké des informations sur vous de les supprimer. Cependant, il est important de noter que ces services peuvent choisir de ne pas répondre à cette demande, en fonction de leurs propres politiques et de la loi en vigueur. Si cela se produit, le service Incogni peut intervenir pour s&rsquo;assurer que la demande est traitée de manière appropriée, mais il ne peut pas garantir que toutes les informations seront effectivement supprimées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pour avoir utilisé Incogni personnellement, je peux vous dire que l&rsquo;on ne se rend pas bien compte de qui a quoi comme donnée nous concernant. Des sociétés dont vous n&rsquo;avez jamais entendu parler se retrouvent avec vos noms, adresse, numéro de téléphone, parfois numéro de sécurité sociale&nbsp;&#8230; alors que vous n&rsquo;avez jamais donné toutes ces infos à un même site. La magie des données croisées. Il suffit d&rsquo;obtenir une base de données du service X, d&rsquo;acheter une autre d’Y, de profiter d&rsquo;un hack de la messagerie du&nbsp;réseau social Z, combiner les&nbsp;3 et pouf on un profil ultra complet. Facile ensuite de vous contacter en vous donnant une certaine impression d&rsquo;être officiel puisqu&rsquo;ils ont des infos qui sont censées être réservées à des services officiels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref si vous êtes sensible au respect de votre vie privée et/ou si vous voulez vous protéger à l&rsquo;avenir, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à jeter un oeil sur le service. Pour moins de 6€/mois, ils vont gérer tout à votre place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Découvrir Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Son nom : <a href=\"https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ChaiNNer</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChaiNNer est un outil de traitement d&rsquo;images qui utilise un fonctionnement à case de graphiques avec des noeuds et des liens entre ces noeuds, ce qui permet d&rsquo;enchainer des tâches relatives aux images. On y retrouve des fonctionnalités assez classiques de recadrage, de redimensionnement&#8230;etc., mais également des tâches infiniment plus complexes puisqu’utilisant des réseaux neuronaux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131556\" width=\"665\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot.webp 866w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot-300x260.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/simple_screenshot-768x665.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, dans vos pipelines, vous pourrez augmenter la taille des images sans perte de qualité avec des algos de type ESRGan, ou rafraichir des photos anciennes avec des modèles de restauration de visage&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil codé en Python est disponible sur tous les OS (macOS, Windows, Linux) et supporte PyTorch, NCNN et ONNX. Une fois lancé, tout ce que vous avez à faire, c&rsquo;est de glisser / déposer des noeuds et de les connecter entre eux. Chaque poignée présente sur un noeud dispose de fonctions spécifiques selon sa couleur, ce qui permet de savoir quoi relier avec quoi. Un vrai jeu d&rsquo;enfant.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1448860395\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Et une fois que vous êtes satisfait de votre « pipe », vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à cliquer sur le bouton vert « Run » pour lancer le process.

Son nom : L&rsquo;AFG01 de  CHEFREE.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Une friteuse à air polyvalente</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je vous arrête tout de suite, rien à voir avec Xavier Niel.  <strong>L&rsquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/CHEFREE-dInt%C3%A9rieur-%C3%89lectrique-AFG01-Pr%C3%A9chauffer/dp/B0BKZNM4SC/sr_1_5?maas=maas_adg_C7D7ABCF7963E4E6C11F189EE3822130_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=amazon0d16-21&amp;__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=friteuse+sans+huile&amp;m=AYUC1COT3XCRR&amp;qid=1669964698&amp;qu=1-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AFG01</a></strong> est une friteuse à air de couleur noire mesurant précisément 42,6 cm de long sur 34,3 cm de large et de 34,7 cm de haut. Elle pèse environ 6 kg et est fabriquée en acier inoxydable ce qui lui donne une belle finition et la rend évidemment résistante à la corrosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au niveau de sa contenance, elle dispose d&rsquo;une capacité de 6 litres et est dotée d&rsquo;une puissance de 1660 watts, soit largement moins qu&rsquo;un four traditionnel</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l3x-chefree-ultenic\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est donc une friteuse à air de taille moyenne qui est assez puissante pour cuire rapidement et efficacement toutes sortes d&rsquo;aliments et pas uniquement des frites. Elle est conçue pour être utilisée en intérieur même pour vos grillades les plus extrêmes et est plutôt silencieuse, ce qui est un plus pour moi qui aime bien écouter de la musique quand je cuisine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Simplicité d&rsquo;utilisation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc eu l&rsquo;occasion de tester cet appareil de chez Ultenic depuis quelques semaines, et je dois dire que je suis vraiment content des plats que j&rsquo;ai cuisinés. Pour vous expliquer un peu mieux le truc, Ultenic est une marque qui possède une sous-marque appelée CHEFREE, spécialisée dans les appareils de cuisine comme ce grill « air fryer » AFG01.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous connaissez déjà les friteuses à air de la marque, sachez que l&rsquo;AFG01 de CHEFREE est plus polyvalente que les modèles précédents (K10 et K20). En effet, elle dispose de huit fonctions de cuisson différentes : barbecue, crisper, rôtir, cuire, griller, frire, steak et préchauffage (bon, OK ce n’est pas vraiment un mode de cuisson, mais je le compte quand même). </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132017\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/grill-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132016\" width=\"578\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/panneau-controle-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Autant vous dire que vous pouvez tout faire avec cet appareil, qui se comporte comme un mini four ! À titre perso, au même titre que la K10 et la K20, cet appareil me simplifie vraiment la vie tous les jours. Plus besoin d&rsquo;allumer mon four ou mes plaques de cuisson pour réchauffer un petit truc ou faire cuire une pognée de nuggets&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les accessoires inclus avec l&rsquo;AFG01 sont d&rsquo;ailleurs très utiles. Le panier à frites et la plaque de grill sont plutôt cool pour préparer des croquettes de poulet maison ou des steaks. Et j&rsquo;ai été agréablement surpris par la qualité de la cuisson notamment au niveau de la viande. Si vous dosez bien la température et le temps de cuisson, le résultat sera tendre et juteux à souhait. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132014\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/chefree-burger-frites-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Des résultats de qualité</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je peux donc tout faire cuire avec cette friteuse à air qui je le rappelle a une capacité de 6 litres pour le bac, et de 4 litres pour le panier. Donc ça reste quand même un bon volume pour cuisiner pour 4 personnes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai par exemple fait des pavés de boeuf et la viande est restée saignante comme je l&rsquo;aime. Même chose avec les frites qui étaient croustillantes. Bref, on obtient le même résultat qu&rsquo;avec une friteuse à huile ou un barbecue bien chaud. Manque que l&rsquo;odeur du feu de bois&#8230; par contre, la dégoulinade d&rsquo;huile de friture ne me manque pas. Et contrairement à ce qu&rsquo;on pourrait penser, non, la viande ne se dessèche pas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"563\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132013\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2.webp 563w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/frites2-225x300.webp 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Une cuisson rapide et efficace</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Grâce aux quatre niveaux de chauffage et à sa puissance de 1660 watts, vous pouvez facilement ajuster la chaleur pour cuire la viande à différents stades (saignant, moyen et bien cuit). Elle consomme également 80% d&rsquo;énergie en moins par rapport aux méthodes de cuisson traditionnelles, ce qui n&rsquo;est pas négligeable surtout en ce moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;AFG01 est également dotée d&rsquo;un système de préchauffage qui permet de régler la température en amont. Cela est très utile pour obtenir une cuisson uniforme et un meilleur « croustillant » de vos aliments. Par contre, il faudra être patient (c&rsquo;est le concept du préchauffage) et attendre quelques minutes avant de mettre les aliments dedans, mais cela en vaut vraiment la peine. Après vous pourrez retourner bidouiller sur le PC, et attendre que ça sonne.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Facile à nettoyer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le nettoyage de la CHEFREE, c&rsquo;est également très simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le revêtement anti-adhésif du bac et de la plaque de grill rend le nettoyage rapide et facile. Il suffit de rincer les pièces à l&rsquo;eau chaude et de les essuyer avec un chiffon doux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même si je ne fais pas de « conseil en investissement » (lol), je vous la recommande fortement, car pour un peu plus de 200 €,  c&rsquo;est loin d&rsquo;être un gadget. Je l&rsquo;utilise tous les jours avec sa petite soeur la K20 et je ne pourrais plus m&rsquo;en passer. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-132015\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/K20-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Je ne fais plus rien bruler, on mange beaucoup moins gras, je crame moins de gaz et d&rsquo;électricité, et les frites sont au top, y compris quand je les fais avec de vraies patates coupées en morceaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si j&rsquo;avais un petit bémol à apporter quand même, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;elle prend un peu de place et qu&rsquo;elle peut ne pas être adaptée à tous les espaces de rangement en raison de son couvercle qui s&rsquo;ouvre par le haut. C&rsquo;est à prendre en compte si vous avez une petite cuisine. Mais bon, à part ça c&rsquo;est vraiment top et une fois encore c&rsquo;est un appareil qui s&rsquo;appelle « friteuse à air » mais que je considère plutôt comme un mini four super efficace, paramétrable à souhait et polyvalent. Mon prochain projet avec, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;y faire cuire mon propre pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>60 euros de réduction sur l&rsquo;AFG01</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour encore plus d&rsquo;économies, profitez du code promo exclusif de 30 euros, valable jusqu&rsquo;au 24 décembre, en utilisant le code <strong>AFG01KORBEN</strong>.

L&rsquo;année arrive à sa fin et comme vous avez peut-être remarqué si vous me suivez sur <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch</a>, j&rsquo;ai commencé un petit break qui va durer jusqu&rsquo;au début janvier. Ne vous inquiétez pas, comme d&rsquo;habitude, j&rsquo;ai plein d&rsquo;articles programmés pour les jours qui viennent, donc ce sera totalement transparent pour vous 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors je ne sais pas comment s&rsquo;est passé l&rsquo;année 2022 pour vous, mais pour moi, ça s&rsquo;est plutôt bien déroulé. Voici d&rsquo;ailleurs quelques « achievements » dont je suis plutôt fier. Tout d&rsquo;abord, j&rsquo;ai réussi à remettre ma coquille de noix (korben.info) sur pied malgré les difficultés économiques de l&rsquo;année dernière. Le trafic sur mon site a même plutôt augmenté, donc c&rsquo;est super cool et je retrouve beaucoup de plaisir à écrire, surtout en cette période de fêtes. C&rsquo;est donc une affaire qui roule 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mon compte <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@korbeninfo?lang=fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok</a> a également explosé, ce qui m&rsquo;offre également de nouvelles opportunités. J&rsquo;aime bien tourner ces petites vidéos et les gens ont l&rsquo;air de les apprécier, donc c&rsquo;est cool, je vais continuer. Ensuite, sur un plan personnel, j&rsquo;ai bien avancé dans les travaux à la maison. C&rsquo;est de plus en plus habitable même s&rsquo;il fait encore bien froid à l&rsquo;intérieur&#8230; Mais là, à part dépenser une fortune pour une isolation par l&rsquo;extérieur, je ne vois pas ce qui pourrait me sauver. J&rsquo;ai également obtenu mon permis tronçonneuse et j&rsquo;en suis extrêmement fier. Et enfin, je me suis enfin marié après avoir dû décaler la cérémonie de 2 ans à cause du Covid. Woohoo !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour 2022. C&rsquo;était cool et pour cette année 2023 qui arrive, je n&rsquo;ai pas spécialement d&rsquo;ambitions autres que de continuer sur ma lancée, c&rsquo;est-à-dire de faire plaisir aux <a href=\"https://patreon.com/korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreons</a> et de continuer à partager avec vous toutes mes découvertes tech au fil de l&rsquo;eau. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et vous, comment ça s&rsquo;est passé ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A très bientôt ! Et passez de bonnes fêtes de fin d&rsquo;année 🍾  !</p>\n",

Il y a les développeurs qu&rsquo;il faut chouchouter évidemment, mais également les designers et les gens du marketing afin que le « produit » qui est porté par votre entreprise rencontre un franc succès. Sacrée mission, et tout ça sans jamais perdre votre sourire ni votre sens de l&rsquo;humour !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pas simple 🙂</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/rr-talent-product-manager-trk\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce métier de product manager est encore assez récent en France, mais a su se rendre indispensable dans de nombreuses entreprises Tech. Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, le rôle d&rsquo;un product manager est donc de faire correspondre les besoins des utilisateurs avec les attentes de la société qui l&#8217;emploie afin de créer un modèle économique pérenne. Le product manager doit donc garder un oeil sur la faisabilité technique du projet, sa facilité d&rsquo;utilisation et sa valeur en termes de business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cet article a été rédigé en partenariat avec&nbsp;<a href=\"https://me.korben.info/pbh-talentio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io</a>. Si ce genre de sujet vous intéresse, vous pouvez rejoindre leur communauté tech, le talent club. En vous inscrivant gratuitement, vous aurez accès à du contenu exclusif, comme des conseils d’experts qui travaillent chez Google, Deezer, Sorare&#8230; Vous aurez également accès à leur étude des salaires annuelle, ainsi que la possibilité de poser vos questions carrière à l’ensemble des 40 000 membre de manière anonyme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rejoignez la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a></strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/talent-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"429\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, la réussite d&rsquo;un projet se mesure sur l&rsquo;impact généré par le produit et non plus bêtement sur « Est-ce que ça a été livré ? ». On s&rsquo;éloigne donc d&rsquo;une mesure bête et méchante comme une « quantité de features » sorties pour plutôt mesurer si l&rsquo;application (ou l&rsquo;objet) a été un succès en matière d&rsquo;utilisateurs ou d&rsquo;acheteurs. C&rsquo;est beaucoup plus pragmatique comme approche et ça permet par la suite de prendre des décisions beaucoup plus éclairées sur les améliorations à apporter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, un produit réussi c&rsquo;est un produit qu&rsquo;on peut faire techniquement (ce n’est pas un scoop), qui sera utilisé régulièrement par les utilisateurs et enfin, c&rsquo;est un produit qui rapporte de l&rsquo;argent ou un fort gain de temps ou d&rsquo;efficacité. Si votre produit ne remplit pas ces objectifs, il vous faut un product manager, alors pourquoi pas vous ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alors en tant que dev, quelles sont les raisons principales de quitter son job de codeur pour devenir product manager ?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Déjà, ça peut paraitre idiot dit comme ça, mais vous aurez beaucoup plus d&rsquo;influence sur le projet. Avec votre vue d&rsquo;ensemble, vous déciderez des priorités et des objectifs à atteindre et c&rsquo;est vous qui mènerez le projet à son succès (ou à sa perte ^^).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le métier de product manager est également beaucoup plus varié. En tant que développeur, vous vous concentrez essentiellement sur des problématiques techniques, allant jusqu&rsquo;à compter les accolades dans votre code. Le product manager, avec une casquette technique, a l&rsquo;opportunité de travailler sur des problématiques plus larges qui vont bien au-delà du code. Cela peut être des aspects plus stratégiques comme la commercialisation, la capitalisation des retours utilisateurs, l&rsquo;amélioration du design&#8230;etc. C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;un certain point de vue, beaucoup plus enrichissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, devenir product manager ça veut aussi dire faire le lien entre toutes les équipes. Développeurs, designers, marketeux, data scientist, c&rsquo;est vous qui donnez le « la » et qui êtes le chef d&rsquo;orchestre de tout ce petit monde. Donc forcément, dans ce job, vous apprendrez énormément au contact des autres, à la fois techniquement et humainement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, tout n&rsquo;est pas tout rose et il y a de nombreux défis à relever quand on passe de dev à product manager. Vous serez responsable des enjeux commerciaux donc ce sera à vous de prendre les bonnes décisions pour que le produit « fonctionne » et rapporte à l&rsquo;entreprise. Vous devrez également gérer les conflits et les différences de points de vue entre les équipes et les personnes. Et vous devrez sans cesse décider de tout&#8230; Faire des choix sur la stratégie, sur la technique, sur les équipes&#8230; etc. Ces choix auront des impacts que vous devrez assumer. Bref, Product Manager, c&rsquo;est aussi savoir prendre des décisions difficiles.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131855\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/62a72d22a867303f3abd5ae4_2.2-Skills-of-a-PM-768x512.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si en sachant tout cela, ça vous botte encore, sachez qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas spécifiquement de formation pour passer de développeur à product manager. Vous devez être capable de comprendre les responsabilités, les compétences et les enjeux du métier. Vous devez être un excellent communiquant et surtout être très organisé avec une forte résilience / adaptabilité et une grande capacité d&rsquo;apprentissage, car ça va fuser dans tous les sens, je vous le promets ^^. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à trouver des mentors dans ce domaine et de bouquiner des livres sur le sujet, mais également de vous intéresser à tous les aspects du produit sur lequel vous travaillez. L&rsquo;objectif c&rsquo;est de montrer au sein de votre entreprise que vous êtes capable de travailler sur une mission de product management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez également renforcer ou travailler certaines compétences, sur lesquelles vous vous sentez plus fragiles comme la communication, la gestion de projet, la compréhension des enjeux commerciaux, etc. Il existe des formations et des tas de livres sur le leadership, l&#8217;empathie au travail et la communication. Vous pourrez ainsi rapidement mettre en oeuvre vos compétences sur des projets concrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si votre reconversion est dans un cadre de changement d&rsquo;entreprise, pensez à mettre en avant vos compétences de développeur dans votre candidature, pour montrer que vous avez les bases techniques pour rejoindre l&rsquo;entreprise comme product manager, tout en soulignant votre expérience de travail en équipe, vos capacités à résoudre des problèmes complexes et votre intérêt pour les enjeux commerciaux. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas, l&rsquo;objectif c&rsquo;est de convaincre un employeur potentiel que vous saurez lui apporter de la valeur en tant que product manager. Beaucoup plus que si vous étiez resté développeur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En conclusion, passer de développeur à product manager c&rsquo;est comme passer d&rsquo;un sport individuel à un sport d&rsquo;équipe : c&rsquo;est passionnant, stimulant et ça bouge tout le temps ! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, si vous avez envie d&rsquo;avoir une vue d&rsquo;ensemble sur un projet, de travailler vraiment en équipe et de prendre des décisions importantes, le job de product manager est probablement un métier qui vous conviendra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prêt à quitter le code pour devenir le prochain Didier Deschamps du numérique ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour plus de conseils sur votre carrière, vous pouvez rejoindre <a href=\"https://me.korben.info/44c-talent-productmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">le talent club</a>.

Cela vous permettra ainsi de retirer, convertir ou extraire les pistes audio de vos vidéos, ou encore de créer des GIFs animés à partir de celles-ci. Vous pourrez également intégrer en dur les sous-titres sur une vidéo ou réparer / stabiliser une vidéo et j&rsquo;en passe.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"984\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131453\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m.webp 984w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m-300x229.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221116-e9m-768x585.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref, très cool surtout que vous pouvez créer également vos propres presets en utilisant les paramètres de FFMpeg (mais là, faudra bosser un peu plus la documentation).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-530193462\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Tout ce qui est conversion est également très simple avec Videomass.

Enfin, seulement si vous êtes sous Mac, car <a href=\"http://numi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Numi</strong></a> ne fonctionne que sur cet OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numi est une calculatrice (en beta) d&rsquo;un nouveau genre qui permet de faire des calculs normaux, de la conversion d&rsquo;unités, du calcul de pourcentage, du calcul de fonctions&#8230;etc.,etc. au travers d&rsquo;une interface minimaliste et simple au possible. Elle permet ainsi de décrire des tâches de manière naturelle et d&rsquo;obtenir instantanément une réponse précise. Par exemple, « 20 $ en euros &#8211; remise de 5 % » ou « aujourd&rsquo;hui + 2 semaines ».</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131895\" width=\"374\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb.webp 746w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb-298x300.webp 298w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/SCR-20221215-lgb-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Voici quelques unes de ses possibilités : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conversion d&rsquo;unités</strong> : permet de convertir une unité en une autre en utilisant les mots-clés « in », « into », « as » ou « to ». Numi convertira automatiquement les unités pour effectuer les opérations si cela est nécessaire lors de la conversion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Conversion de fuseau horaire</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser la fonction « time » ou « now » pour obtenir l&rsquo;heure dans votre fuseau horaire. Vous pouvez préfixer ces fonctions avec le nom du fuseau horaire (ou utiliser « in » avec un suffixe de fuseau horaire) pour obtenir l&rsquo;heure actuelle pour un lieu spécifié. Les résultats sont toujours synchronisés avec l&rsquo;heure mondiale, donc en tout temps vous obtiendrez l&rsquo;heure exacte. Il est également possible de convertir une heure ou une date spécifique d&rsquo;un fuseau horaire à un autre. Ou calculez la différence entre les heures dans différents fuseaux horaires.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Opérations</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser des opérateurs en signe et en mot. Plusieurs expressions peuvent être empilées ensemble. Notez que les expressions seront multipliées si elles sont utilisées dans des parenthèses les unes après les autres.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nombres</strong> : en plus du système numérique décimal, il est possible d&rsquo;utiliser des nombres en binaire, en octal ou en hexadécimal en utilisant le préfixe approprié : 0b, 0o et 0x. Vous pouvez utiliser les mots-clés « sci » ou « scientific » pour formater les résultats en notation scientifique.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Devises</strong> : vous pouvez utiliser les codes ISO 4217 pour les devises (comme USD, RUB, CAD, etc.). Vous pouvez également utiliser les noms et les symboles des devises courantes, comme le $ pour les dollars américains, les roubles pour les roubles russes ou € pour l&rsquo;euro. Numi met à jour les taux de change plusieurs fois par jour en utilisant le service de taux de change ouvert. Numi prend également en charge une grande liste de cryptomonnaies avec des mises à jour horaires des taux.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pourcentages</strong> : en plus des opérations de pourcentage générales comme l&rsquo;ajout ou la soustraction d&rsquo;un pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur ($10 &#8211; 40%), vous pouvez également utiliser des opérations supplémentaires : pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur, ajout de pourcentage, soustraction de pourcentage, pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre, ajout de pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre, soustraction de pourcentage d&rsquo;une valeur par rapport à une autre.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fonctions</strong> : Numi supporte une large gamme de fonctions mathématiques courantes, y compris les fonctions trigonométriques, exponentielles et logarithmiques. Vous pouvez également utiliser des fonctions d&rsquo;arrondi, de pourboire et de pourcentage de gain/perte.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>En utilisant ces fonctionnalités, Numi vous permet de simplifier vos calculs et de les effectuer rapidement et facilement sur votre Mac. Essayez-la dès maintenant pour voir à quel point elle est rapide, jolie et bien plus agréable que ceci :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img width=\"478\" height=\"315\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2015/07/alc.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1253804088\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p><em>Article rédigé le 6 juillet 2015 et mis à jour le 15 décembre 2022.</em></p>\n",

Moins de 55€ (+TVA)&nbsp;pour 26 mois de protection, et cela <strong>sur un nombre illimité d&rsquo;appareils</strong> ! Difficile de faire mieux, pas encore d&rsquo;inflation chez Surfshark 😉 Et comme toujours vous pouvez encore&nbsp;ajouter une couche de sécu supplémentaire&nbsp;avec le combo alertes +&nbsp;moteur de recherche + l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Antivirus Surfshark</a> (39€ pour les 26 semaines).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"87\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8ik-surfsharknoel\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est le VPN que j&rsquo;utilise personnellement et ce que j&rsquo;apprécie c&rsquo;est que depuis leur lancement (en 2018) ils évoluent sans cesse et plutôt vite. Il y a un mois c&rsquo;était le lancement de <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-nexus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-nexus.html\">Surfshark Nexus</a> par exemple, une fonctionnalité qui permet de stabiliser et améliorer la qualité de sa connexion. En ce mois de décembre, c&rsquo;est au tour du service CleanWeb de subir une refonte et de passer au niveau supérieur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour rappel, l&rsquo;option CleanWeb de base permet de bloquer les publicités et de vous protéger contre les malwares et autres tentatives de phishing. Avec la nouvelle&nbsp;mouture 2.0 les possibilités sont bien supérieures.&nbsp;Cette version n&rsquo;est pour l&rsquo;instant&nbsp;disponible&nbsp;que&nbsp;via&nbsp;les extensions pour navigateurs Firefox, Chrome&nbsp;et Edge. Donc sur Firefox. Les autres n&rsquo;existant pas (bouh j&rsquo;ai fais un troll sur mon site&nbsp;:p).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"320\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/9zgsLDswv632U/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>j&rsquo;en ai fait 2 du coup</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Les options de <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CleanWeb 2.0</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Outre une nouvelle version du moteur de blocage des publicités,&nbsp;elle dispose d&rsquo;une personnalisation et d&rsquo;un affinage des blocages pour chacun&nbsp;site visité,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;Cet affinage se fait sur 4 aspects (tous activés par défaut, mais&nbsp;modulable dans les paramètres)&nbsp;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>le <strong>bloqueur de pubs</strong> : ne se limite plus seulement&nbsp;aux différentes bannières texte/image, il prend aussi en compte les encarts présents dans les vidéos ou sur les plateformes de streaming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>le <strong>bloqueur de pop-up</strong> : va bloquer les ouvertures de fenêtres pop-up, incluant notamment les cookies de consentement/RGPD, etc. Par défaut il va les refuser automatiquement si c&rsquo;est possible, sinon accepter uniquement&nbsp;les cookies&nbsp;obligatoires.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>les <strong>alertes malwares</strong> : vous prévient en cas de téléchargement&nbsp;risqué ou d&rsquo;activité suspicieuse de la page sur laquelle vous êtes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>les <strong>alertes de fuite de données</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131803\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2.jpg 700w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/surfshark-cleanweb-2-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ces dernières sont vraiment intéressantes. Cela vous permet de savoir si les sites que vous visitez ont déjà eu&nbsp;des soucis par le passé. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, il vous fournit un tas d&rsquo;informations :&nbsp;à quelle date,&nbsp;de quelle nature, le nombre de comptes concernés, etc. Pratique, car si l&rsquo;un de ces sites&nbsp;à déjà plusieurs fuites&nbsp;à son actif, peut-être que cela vous fera réfléchir avant d&rsquo;y laisser vos données personnelles. Ou bien la passoire qu&rsquo;il semble être sera tellement énorme que vous bannirez ce site à vie par peur (<em>#coucouFacebook</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez aussi vous servir de ces informations comme d&rsquo;un système de surveillance personnalisé. Si un service que vous utilisez se fait hacker sans que vous soyez au courant, vous verrez une alerte apparaitre dès que Surfshark aura vent du problème. Cela vous amènera sans doute à modifier votre mot de passe au plus vite.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"210\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/EGe7H8HTtw3Cg/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Du coup <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark</a> a décidé de lui donner une vraie place dans son interface avec&nbsp;une section dédiée sur&nbsp;le tableau de bord (c&rsquo;était inclus dans la section VPN auparavant). D&rsquo;ailleurs je le précise pour ceux qui se poseraient la question : <strong>CleanWeb fonctionne même sans être connecté au VPN</strong>, donc en permanence tant que vous utilisez&nbsp;votre navigateur (et que l&rsquo;extension est active, Captain Obvious represent).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore une bonne raison de plus pour se tourner vers Surfshark VPN !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;en profite pour vous rappeler que si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas très chaud pour payer par carte bancaire ou Paypal, le site propose aussi les paiements Google Pay/Amazon Pay et même celui&nbsp;en cryptomonnaies (via les fournisseurs CoinGate et CoinPayments).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Profitez de l&rsquo;offre hivernale à -84% + 2 mois gratuit</a></h2>\n",

Génial non ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous faites partie des dernières 5 personnes au monde à mettre des watermarks sur la photo, c&rsquo;est également possible.

Et cela est possible grâce au script WebOSINT qui une fois en place sur votre machine, ira collecter toutes ces informations, soit directement, soit en utilisant certains services tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour que tout fonctionne correctement avec <a href=\"https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/WebOSINT/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WebOSINT</a>, vous devrez donc vous créer des comptes sur différents services afin de récupérer les clés API. Les clés seront à renseigner dans le fichier config.json.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant l&rsquo;API HackerTarget, pas d&rsquo;obligation puisque vous pouvez utiliser l&rsquo;offre gratuite limitée à quelques requêtes en utilisant l&rsquo;option « -F ». Concernant l&rsquo;<a href=\"https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">API WhoisXML</a> ou <a href=\"https://whoisfreaks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhoisFreaks</a>, il vous faudra par contre créer un compte, mais rassurez vous, c&rsquo;est gratuit dans une certaine limite. WhoisXML se limite gratuitement à 500 recherches et WhoisFreaks à 100 recherches gratuites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour installer WebOSINT, ouvrez un terminal et entrez les commandes suivantes : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/webosint\ncd webosint\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\npython3 webosint.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1584905815\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Pensez à bien renseigner les clés API dans le fichier config.json. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois l&rsquo;outil lancé, vous n&rsquo;avez plus qu&rsquo;à entrer le nom de domaine et laisser faire la magie de WebOSINT.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131317\" width=\"662\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i.webp 840w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i-300x268.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221109-e1i-768x686.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Merci à Deuza, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/korben\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soutien Patreon de renom</a>, pour la découverte.</p>\n",

Elle a sorti un livre d&rsquo;énigmes, il y a quelque temps, en collaboration avec son co-auteur Taharn, intitulé « La Clef » et j&rsquo;avais envie de vous le faire découvrir.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131820\" width=\"610\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8-300x195.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/0f31d15798471097228db8b423cae8-768x499.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est un livre unique en son genre (sérieux il n&rsquo;y a pas d&rsquo;équivalent !), qui combine une histoire passionnante et des énigmes complexes à résoudre grâce, notamment, à l&rsquo;utilisation d&rsquo;une lampe UV comme dans les Experts ^^.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai eu la chance de « tester » ce livre et j&rsquo;ai vraiment été impressionnée par la qualité des illustrations qui m&rsquo;ont plongé dans l&rsquo;univers fantastique imaginé par Fanélia, ainsi que par l&rsquo;originalité des énigmes proposées. Enfin, je dis « originalité », mais on encore au-delà de ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le livre s&rsquo;appelle « La Clef » et c&rsquo;est un ouvrage assez costaud, avec une couverture rigide et un papier d’une grande qualité, ce qui le classe dans la catégorie des livres de collection. Offrez-le à un(e) ami(e) geek et il ou elle vous aimera pour la vie ^^. Chaque double page du livre propose ainsi une énigme à résoudre, sans énoncé explicite. Oui, j&rsquo;ai bien dit « sans énoncé », ce qui peut, je vous l’avoue être assez perturbant.&nbsp;En tout cas, moi ça me perturbe ^^.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131815\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK3-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Le lecteur devra donc utiliser son sens de l’observation digne d&rsquo;un aigle et sa logique implacable pour trouver la solution en se basant évidemment sur le texte et l&rsquo;image. Le livre comporte 75 énigmes en tout, et certaines d&rsquo;entre elles font référence à d&rsquo;autres pages du livre ou <a href=\"https://www.laclef.online/concept/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">même à des sites internet</a>.&nbsp;Vous imaginez le délire ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un Discord est également disponible pour ceux qui souhaitent discuter des énigmes avec d&rsquo;autres lecteurs et avoir un petit coup de pouce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;un des aspects les plus intéressants du livre « La Clef », c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;encre invisible. En utilisant la lampe UV fournie avec le livre, le lecteur peut ainsi découvrir des éléments cachés présents sur certaines pages. Ces indices viennent enrichir l&rsquo;énigme et ajoutent un niveau à la complexité et à l&rsquo;originalité des énigmes. Je vous promets que ça rend l&rsquo;expérience de lecture encore plus immersive et divertissante.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131816\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK5-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131817\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK6-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Concernant l’univers du livre, je vais tenter de vous résumer ce que j’en ai compris. Ça se passe à Astolie, un monde imaginaire dans un style purement Dark Fantasy et le lecteur peut comme ça, découvrir les différents aspects de la mythologie et de la culture d&rsquo;Astolie en résolvant les énigmes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque énigme est plus originale que la précédente, et certaines font même référence à d&rsquo;autres oeuvres de la littérature, du cinéma ou des jeux vidéo. Cela permet aux fans d&rsquo;énigmes de retrouver des références qu&rsquo;ils connaissent bien, tout en découvrant le nouvel univers tout droit sorti de la tête de nos auteurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je l’ai déjà dit, mais les énigmes sont assez complexes, et elles ne sont pas vraiment destinées aux débutants. Ce n’est pas un livre d’énigmes bas de gamme pour s&rsquo;occuper à la plage comme on peut en trouver parfois… Non, non, elles nécessitent une réflexion approfondie et une capacité à associer des éléments divers et variés pour trouver la solution. Cela en fait le livre parfait pour les amateurs d&rsquo;énigmes expérimentés ou les gens à l&rsquo;esprit acéré, cherchant un défi stimulant et original. Je sais, chacun d&rsquo;entre nous pense qu&rsquo;il a l&rsquo;esprit vif et qu&rsquo;il est plus malin que son voisin&#8230; Je vous rassure, ce livre vous aidera à voir la réalité en face, et ça va faire mal ^^.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131818\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK4-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Mon retour sur le bouquin, c’est que je l’adore, mais, la vache, je galère. C’est plus dur qu’un challenge de hacking 😉 en tout cas, je suis loin de l’avoir fini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les fans d&rsquo;univers fantastique ou de Fantasy apprécieront également la qualité des illustrations et l&rsquo;ambiance immersive créée par Fanelia. D’ailleurs, si vous appréciez ses dessins, sachez qu&rsquo;elle vend également ses oeuvres sur son site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour conclure, je dirais que « La Clef » est un bouquin original et passionnant qui mérite d&rsquo;être lu par les amateurs d&rsquo;énigmes et d&rsquo;univers fantastiques n’ayant pas peur de se prendre un peu la tête. Tout est qualitatif dans ce livre et les énigmes + l&rsquo;utilisation de l&rsquo;encre invisible, en font un livre à la fois beau et stimulant pour notre petit cerveau tout mou. Ça change !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La complexité des énigmes et la richesse de l&rsquo;univers d&rsquo;Astolie en feront un cadeau idéal pour vos amis ou votre famille, en particulier à l&rsquo;approche de Noël.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131814\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2-300x225.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/12/OK2-768x576.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes intéressé, vous pouvez <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BeZiYk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>le commander en ligne</strong></a> ou le trouver dans une librairie spécialisée ou directement <strong><a href=\"https://www.fanelia.art/22-la-clef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sur le site de Fanéli</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.fanelia.art/22-la-clef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>a</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encore merci à Fanelia de m’avoir fait découvrir Astolie !</p>\n",

Bref tous ceux qui vendent ou utilisent de la publicité personnalisée. Et malheureusement ces infos finissent toujours par fuiter ou être revendues. GAFAM, application mobile&nbsp;ou petit site e-commerce,&nbsp;pas une semaine ne passe sans que&nbsp;l&rsquo;un de ces&nbsp;services subisse un leak ou un piratage quelconque. Certains sont même créées quasiment juste pour cela, par exemple des applis spéciales pour profiter des offres du Black Friday qui revendent vos données une fois la période terminée.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"426\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/19u-incogni3\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Dans 91.24% des cas (estimation personnelle scientifiquement validée et basée sur mon flair digne de Rantanplan), cela se fait à votre insu. Vous recevez parfois un mail ou un SMS louche pour lequel vous vous demandez comment les gens ont eu vos coordonnées, mais le plus souvent c&rsquo;est flou ou vous l&rsquo;acceptez comme allant de soi. Quoi de plus normal que la publicité ciblée et basée sur nos préférences ? Vous commencez dans les cryptos et n&rsquo;avez encore jamais interagi avec ces services ? Combien de temps avant de recevoir des mails de phishing Metamask &amp; Co ? Pas très longtemps dans la plupart des cas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dès que votre mail, votre numéro de téléphone, votre nom&nbsp;&#8230; est&nbsp;lié à un&nbsp;centre d&rsquo;intérêt particulier vous êtes foutu, ça va tourner dans des dizaines de bases de données chez les data brokers. Vous devez alors leur demander de les retirer. Selon les pays ils sont parfois légalement tenus de le faire, mais même dans ce cas ils traineront des pieds au maximum, car c&rsquo;est leur gagne-pain. Et il faut déjà commencer par les identifier, ce qui n&rsquo;est pas&nbsp;souvent simple à faire. Bonjour les maux de tête.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YpmVBNubONoqs/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"224\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là</a> pour faire le travail à votre place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En utilisant le service, vous allez commencer par lui renseigner les différentes informations que vous voulez faire retirer d&rsquo;Internet. Ensuite Incogni prend tout en charge. Ils vont analyser en continu qui sont les data brokers possédant vos infos et leur demander de les effacer. Pour l&rsquo;instant plus de 145 brokers sont surveillés et la liste s&rsquo;allonge chaque mois (ils n&rsquo;en suivaient que 76 au lancement du produit il y a quelques mois). Si ces derniers ne répondent pas, ils vont les relancer sans arrêt et augmenter la pression jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Et même lorsque c&rsquo;est retiré ils vont continuer à surveiller que cela reste bien le cas. Un peu comme si vous vous mettiez sur liste rouge du web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incogni annonce sauver environ 300 heures de travail. J&rsquo;imagine que c&rsquo;est dans le cas où vous seriez présent sur tous les data brokers qu&rsquo;ils surveillent et je ne peux pas vérifier cette info, mais quand même. Cela en fait du temps gagné et vous suivrez l&rsquo;évolution de la situation via un tableau de bord régulièrement mis à jour. Vous pouvez y voir le nom des sociétés qui détiennent vos informations, ce qu&rsquo;elles en font,&nbsp;où en est la procédure de suppression et parfois à qui elles communiquent leurs données. Voir <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">mon test d&rsquo;Incogni</a> si vous voulez voir à quoi ça ressemble.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130591\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-300x155.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En résumé Incogni agit comme un intermédiaire. Ce n&rsquo;est pas qu&rsquo;ils font quelque chose que vous ne pourriez faire vous-mêmes, ils sont plutôt là pour vous faire gagner du temps et que vous n&rsquo;ayez pas à recommencer le travail tous les x mois. Comparé à d&rsquo;autres outils du même genre les tarifs sont plutôt bas puisqu&rsquo;ils sont de l&rsquo;ordre de moins de 5.8€/mois sur l&rsquo;abonnement à l&rsquo;année.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Et puisque ce sont bientôt les fêtes, voici déjà un bon plan qui pourrait vous faire plaisir.&nbsp;Profitez d&rsquo;une<strong> offre à -60 % sur l’abonnement d’un an à Incogni</strong> en ajoutant le code INCOGNI60 lors de votre commande !! Vous avez jusqu&rsquo;au 4 décembre&nbsp;alors ne tardez pas&nbsp;!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez comme plan de disparaitre virtuellement bientôt, c&rsquo;est peut-être un outil qui vous rendra quelques services 😉 Enfin si vous habitez en Europe (inclus l&rsquo;Angleterre), aux USA, en Suisse&nbsp;ou&nbsp;au Canada. Pour les autres pays, ce n&rsquo;est pas encore pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni, efface-moi d&rsquo;Internet stp !</a></h2>\n",

Cela vous permettra de communiquer rapidement et facilement avec vos collaborateurs, vos clients et même les internautes de passage sur votre site web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Très pratique si vous êtes une startup ou une PME qui met à disposition un numéro de téléphone ou qui dispose d&rsquo;un webchat sur son site web pour répondre à toutes les demandes de ses clients. Je pense notamment à tous les e-commerçants ou les startups naissantes qui n&rsquo;ont pas encore les moyens des grosses entreprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est pour cela que 3CX propose une solution de standard téléphonique et de plateforme de messagerie gérée par leurs soins et dans certains cas, hébergée sur vos propres serveurs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/8874b5-3CX\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"300\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>L&rsquo;offre StartUP Free</strong></a> est donc un bon moyen de découvrir les possibilités de la plateforme de 3CX sans débourser un centime.

Vous accueillez vos clients comme il se doit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, de quoi gérer votre propre petit standard téléphonique gratuitement et surtout facilement, car l&rsquo;interface est vraiment très propre et très claire.

Cela vous permettra d&rsquo;avoir un suivi des conversations avec votre clientèle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaque membre du groupe peut également paramétrer ses heures de présence pour que le standard sache où et quand renvoyer les appels. C&rsquo;est plutôt génial d&rsquo;avoir un outil totalement VoIP comme celui-ci qui peut être parfaitement utilisé par les gens en télétravail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>3CX a vraiment fait du très bon travail. Comme je le disais, l&rsquo;outil est simple à prendre en main, même pour le néophyte et chacun peut alors bénéficier d&rsquo;un standard VoIP gratuitement. Les visioconférences et les appels téléphoniques sont parfaitement fluides et d&rsquo;un bon niveau de qualité, mais surtout, ce qui fait la force de 3CX c&rsquo;est vraiment l&rsquo;implémentation de ces technologies (VoIP / WebRTC) dans une suite qui offre toutes les fonctionnalités nécessaires aux petites, moyennes et grandes entreprises qui ont des besoins de communication clientèle. De plus, les fonctionnalités de messagerie que ce soit via WhatsApp ou Livechat, en intégration sur un site web, sont idéales pour recueillir les échanges clients en réduisant les temps d&rsquo;attente et les temps d&rsquo;échange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, c&rsquo;est vraiment un outil à essayer si vous avez besoin de mettre en place un live chat ou un standard téléphonique. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pour vous inscrire, c&rsquo;est par ici</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous avez besoin de documentation, <a href=\"https://www.3cx.fr/docs/startup/?src=korben-fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">celle-ci se trouve ici</a>.</p>\n",

Seulement voilà, malgré tout l&rsquo;amour que vous portez à Firefox, vous restez quand même conscient que parfois, il peut bouffer un peu *trop* de mémoire.

Alors c&rsquo;est vrai que Windows sait également nettoyer la mémoire, mais il ne le fait pas aussi souvent que Firmin qui lui veille particulièrement sur Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois Firemin lancé, vous choisissez une fréquence de « nettoyage » en millisecondes (par défaut c&rsquo;est 1000 ms), mais les développeurs de Firemin indiquent que les résultats seront meilleurs avec 500 ms. Vous pouvez également spécifier une quantité de mémoire propre à Firefox, à ne pas dépasser (ici 100 MB).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131157\" width=\"433\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2.webp 655w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221104-a26-2-256x300.webp 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Là où c&rsquo;est sympa, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez lui indiquer d&rsquo;autres navigateurs (Chrome, Brave, Edge&#8230;etc.) en cliquant simplement sur le bouton « Parcourir ». J&rsquo;imagine que ça peut fonctionner également avec d&rsquo;autres applications qui ne sont pas des navigateurs, donc à essayer sur vos applications consommatrices de mémoire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;outil doit être lancé en même temps que le navigateur pour fonctionner, donc pensez bien à cocher la case « Démarrer Firemin quand Windows démarre » pour ensuite l&rsquo;oublier.

Mais il y a aussi la stabilité de votre ligne ADSL, de votre Fibre ou de votre connexion 4G/5G qui est importante. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une connexion avec beaucoup de bande passante, c&rsquo;est cool pour regarder une vidéo en ligne ou télécharger un fichier, mais pour des activités moins gourmandes comme la visioconférence ou les jeux vidéos, ce qui compte surtout c&rsquo;est que les réponses à vos requêtes soient rapides et fiables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vos requêtes ne parviennent pas à leur destination, les paquets sont alors perdus et cela peut dégrader votre expérience de jeu par exemple. Sur du FPS, pour être bien il faudrait que le ping soit à minima bien en dessous des 60ms et qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait aucun paquet perdu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Même chose pour les visioconférences ou la VoIP, vous devez avoir quelque chose de bon niveau ping et une certaine régularité dans l&rsquo;arrivée de vos paquets TCP pour que la discussion reste compréhensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-991969282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Alors, comment évaluer ça ? Et bien rendez-vous sur le site <a href=\"https://packetlosstest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Packet Loss Test</a> pour mesurer la fiabilité de votre connexion, et déterminer à la fois la latence, mais également le pourcentage de paquets perdus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131060\" width=\"717\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-300x170.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-axy-768x435.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>De mon côté, je suis plutôt pas mal. Si de votre côté, vous avez beaucoup de paquets perdus, ce n&rsquo;est pas forcément la faute de votre FAI. Jouez avec les réglages du site pour adapter le test à votre bande passante maximale.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"617\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131061\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw.webp 617w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221022-ayw-241x300.webp 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si ça ne change rien, il est fort probable que vous ayez sur votre réseau local, un routeur ou une carte réseau qui se comporte mal. Il faudra alors jouer au jeu du « <em>Je te débranche, je re-teste et je vois si ça va mieux</em>« .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, si rien ne cloche, un petit coup de fil au fournisseur d&rsquo;accès internet. Bon courage avec cette dernière étape.</p>\n",

Ou en français, un courtier en données ?&nbsp;Pas vraiment&nbsp;? Pourtant je suis presque certain que vous en avez forcément rencontré un dans votre vie sur Internet, voire plusieurs. Ils pullulent tellement qu&rsquo;il&nbsp;est aujourd&rsquo;hui presque impossible de conserver son existence en ligne pour soi. Vos informations sont récupérées et exploitées chez eux.&nbsp;Malheureusement, malgré les dangers qu&rsquo;ils représentent pour les gens, physiquement et virtuellement, tout le monde ne les connait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un courtier en données est un <s>parasite</s> organisme qui récolte des informations personnelles sur le maximum d&rsquo;internautes. Ils compilent leurs différentes sources pour créer un profil plus ou moins précis de vous en recoupant ce qu&rsquo;ils trouvent. Cela va de votre email, à votre adresse, vos noms et prénoms, vos possessions, vos informations légales&nbsp;&#8230; voir vos habitudes d&rsquo;achat et votre historique web.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"368\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/xcj-incogni2\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Où vont-ils chercher ces données ? Et bien déjà de tout ce qui est public par défaut (infos perso lorsque vous créez une société &#8230;) ou partagé publiquement par vous-mêmes (réseaux sociaux &#8230;). Ensuite parce que certains services peu scrupuleux&nbsp;sur lesquels vous vous inscrivez n&rsquo;hésitent pas à les&nbsp;revendre (par exemple votre numéro de carte bancaire que vous avez&nbsp;inséré dans un jeu mobile). Plus de 40% des extensions Chrome sont classées comme <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://blog.incogni.com/chrome-extensions-research/\" target=\"_blank\">étant à risque</a>. Enfin&nbsp;depuis des bases de données, des listes de clients, etc. volées, leakées ou revendues par divers hackeurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois qu&rsquo;ils ont recoupé et centralisé toutes leurs sources, ils vont établir des profils thématisés&nbsp;et revendre à leur tour ces informations à des entités commerciales. Vous venez de divorcer ? Vous allez subitement recevoir de la pub en rapport.&nbsp;Une partie des spams que vous recevez dans votre boite mail, ce sont eux. Des SMS non sollicités ? Encore eux. Des coups de fil intempestifs ? Toujours eux.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xdnytp8742kg0/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Non seulement c&rsquo;est pénible, mais en plus&nbsp;cela peut être dangereux. Certains sites web centralisent les infos et n&rsquo;hésitent pas à&nbsp;les rendre accessibles à tous. Il suffit alors d&rsquo;une recherche sur votre nom pour connaitre éventuellement votre adresse physique, l&rsquo;endroit ou vous travaillez, quelle voiture vous conduisez, si vous possédez une assurance vie ou non, qui sont les membres de votre famille, etc.&nbsp;Heureusement pour cet aspect « porte ouverte au grand&nbsp;public »&nbsp;nous avons certaines protections en France, <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-rgpd.html\">notamment le RGPD</a>. Mais aux USA il y a des sites comme PeekYou, WhitePages, etc. qui les partagent. Et c&rsquo;est flippant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du coup l&rsquo;idéal c&rsquo;est de faire supprimer tout ce qui permet de vous identifier chez ces data brokers. Mais comment faire ? Comment identifier ces courtiers ? Et comment savoir qu&rsquo;un courtier détient vos infos ? Enfin, comment lui faire supprimer&nbsp;ce qu&rsquo;il possède sur vous&nbsp;?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"incogni Dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-131464\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard.jpg 800w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-300x100.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/incogni-dashboard-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ne vous cassez plus le cerveau, <a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Incogni est là pour vous faciliter la vie</a>. Pour quelques euros par mois, le service de Surfshark va scanner tout le web pour :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>retrouver&nbsp;les brokers qui disposent de vos&nbsp;infos personnelles</li>\n\n\n\n<li>contacter&nbsp;ces courtiers&nbsp;pour leur demander de les supprimer (ce qui est votre droit)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>relancer ces derniers s&rsquo;ils ne se bougent pas assez vite</li>\n\n\n\n<li>effectuer un suivit au fil du temps pour s&rsquo;assurer que vos infos ne sont pas remises en ligne</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Et comme Incogni augmente sans cesse sa liste de brokers sous surveillance, plus le temps passe et plus votre protection augmente. Je vous ai fait un<a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\"> test du service complet </a>il y a quelques semaines, j&rsquo;avais été plutôt étonné de voir le nombre de courtiers qui m&rsquo;avaient sous la main (quasi 100 !). Au moins, filez-moi un billet pour exploiter mes données bande de crevards. Surtout au vu des prix auxquels elles se revendent parfois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/6u1Z9pUakUHG6o7oiV/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"303\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref avec Incogni vous allez économiser pas mal de temps, de maux de tête et d&rsquo;énervement lorsque les data brokers ignorerons vos mails. Non, mais qui êtes-vous pour leur retirer le pain de la bouche aussi ? L&rsquo;autre gros avantage du service est de vous présenter un suivit via un tableau de bord très simple à prendre en main. Vous&nbsp;verrez combien de brokers ont vos infos et suivrez en temps réel l&rsquo;avancée du&nbsp;retrait de vos données.&nbsp;Ainsi que&nbsp;le travail de sape d&rsquo;Incogni pour les relancer sans cesse jusqu&rsquo;à ce qu&rsquo;ils obtempèrent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Une corde de plus à l&rsquo;arc du respect de la vie privée sur Internet. C&rsquo;est toujours bon à prendre.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Commencez la saison des fêtes avec un peu plus&nbsp;de tranquillité d&rsquo;esprit ! Protégez vos données personnelles&nbsp;et profitez d&rsquo;une réduction de 60 % sur l&rsquo;abonnement d&rsquo;un an à Incogni.

Si vous ne connaissez pas le concept de Serverless, et bien ça va être vite résumé : C&rsquo;est héberger des trucs directement dans le cloud (chez Amazon par exemple), sans avoir ni serveur dédié ni serveur virtualité.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand on est développeur, on peut vite rester bloqué sur les technologies qu&rsquo;on connait par coeur. Toutefois, c&rsquo;est dommage de ne pas continuer à découvrir de nouvelles pratiques ou technologies, car si demain. C&rsquo;est important si vous souhaitez évoluer dans la carrière de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est d&rsquo;ailleurs pour ça que le <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>talent club</strong></a> a été crée. Il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;une communauté tech propulsée par talent.io qui donne accès à du contenu exclusif pour vous accompagner professionnellement. En vous inscrivant (<strong>c&rsquo;est gratuit !!</strong>), vous recevrez tous les 15 jours des conseils d&rsquo;expert(e)s de sociétés comme Google, Deezer, Sorabe&#8230;etc. directement dans votre boite mail. Les sujets partagés sont assez variés comme « Comment devenir VP of Engineering », « Comment passer du dev au produit », « Comment obtenir une augmentation », « quelles sont les choses à savoir quand on est le 1er dev d’une start-up », etc..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au sein du talent club, vous aurez aussi accès aux <strong>études de salaires annuelles dans la tech</strong> réalisées par&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\">talent.io</a>&nbsp;et à d&rsquo;autres outils pour gérer votre carrière</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/fuy-serverless-talentio\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"378\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et bien sûr qui dit communauté, dit possibilité de poser des questions à l&rsquo;ensemble des 40 000 inscrits, de manière anonyme. <a href=\"https://www.talent.io/p/fr-fr/talent-club?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Je vous invite à rejoindre la communauté talent club en cliquant ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenons à notre code et prenons un bout de PHP. Pour le faire fonctionner, vous avez besoin de louer, configurer, et maintenir un serveur. Et évidemment si ce bout de code PHP reçoit beaucoup de trafic, vous devrez aussi augmenter le nombre de serveurs ou libérer des ressources&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serverless, ça permet d&rsquo;éviter cela et donc de réduire les coûts opérationnels, aussi bien en termes d&rsquo;hébergement, que de maintenance&#8230;etc. Et surtout, comme on se repose sur les infrastructures de géants comme Google, Microsoft ou Amazon, ça ne tombe *jamais* en panne et ça peut être scalable (mise à l&rsquo;échelle pour absorber le trafic) très simplement.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est rigolo avec ce concept de serverless, c&rsquo;est que vous pouvez y mettre toute votre application web par exemple ou simplement quelques fonctions critiques. Et c&rsquo;est cela dont on va parler aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, je vais vous expliquer comme exécuter une simple fonction écrite en PHP dans le cloud Amazon, en utilisant leur serveur AWS Lambda.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131403\" width=\"645\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-300x81.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9j-768x206.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Lambda permet d&rsquo;exécuter du code pour n&rsquo;importe quel type d&rsquo;application ou service backend sans avoir à administrer un serveur et en payant uniquement le temps de calcul que vous utilisez. Quand le code n&rsquo;est pas exécuté, vous n&rsquo;êtes pas facturé.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>De quoi a-t-on besoin ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez avoir besoin d&rsquo;un compte chez AWS pour accéder à <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fr/lambda/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lambda</a>.  Nativement avec Lambda, vous pouvez créer des fonctions nodejs, python, go&#8230;etc. Mais pas PHP, en tout cas, pas avec les outils fournis au niveau de la console d&rsquo;administration d&rsquo;AWS Lambda</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131404\" width=\"695\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-300x97.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/SCR-20221114-d9z-768x249.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Donc pour contourner le souci, on va utiliser un framework Composer qui s&rsquo;appelle <a href=\"http://bref.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bref</strong></a> et qui permet de faire tourner du PHP en Serverless sans se prendre la tête. C&rsquo;est top pour des jobs cron, des API ou des petits sites web dont les assets sont servis par Amazon S3. Par contre pour des applications complètes en PHP, ce sera un peu plus complexe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>On passe à l&rsquo;installation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Première étape : <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Installer Composer</a> sur votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>brew install composer</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous allez également <a href=\"https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">avoir besoin de npm</a> : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>brew install npm</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, vous allez devoir installer le framework Serverless dont Bref a besoin pour fonctionner. Cela lui permet d&rsquo;assurer la connexion avec AWS.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install -g serverless</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Droits utilisateur AWS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Côté AWS, vous allez avoir besoin de clés d&rsquo;accès. <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/?tag=amazon0d16-21\" target=\"_blank\">Ça se passe par ici</a>.

Mais avec un petit fond sonore, c&rsquo;est mieux !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais on ne peut pas diffuser n&rsquo;importe quelle musique sur Twitch car sinon, ces derniers coupent le son pour des questions de droits d&rsquo;auteur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc passé par le site Chillhop qui propose des morceaux Lo-Fi / Chill parfaits pour faire un fond sonore sympa dans mon stream. Pour intégrer leur musique, j&rsquo;avais alors 2 possibilités : Streamer leur playlist via Spotify ou streamer leur live YouTube, directement depuis OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotify, je m&rsquo;en sers pour écouter ma musique copyrightée toute la journée donc je ne pouvais pas le dédier à ça. J&rsquo;ai donc créé une source browser chargeant une page HTML de mon cru permettant de jouer la playlist Chillhop en auto play.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"lofi hip hop radio - beats to study/relax to 🐾\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NOSDKb0HlU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-889942282\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;était cool et ça fonctionnait bien. Jusqu&rsquo;au jour où Chillhop (ou YouTube) a bloqué l&rsquo;autoplay sur ses Lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus de musique de fond sur mes streams. J&rsquo;étais tristesse. Puis au bout d&rsquo;un moment, mes millions de viewers ont commencé à me réclamer de la musique en fond sonore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;écoutant que mon abnégation à leur égard, j&rsquo;ai donc décidé de trouver la parade pour streamer un live YouTube dans OBS. Je vais vous détailler tout ça, étape par étape. Pensez bien à envoyer l&rsquo;URL de cet article à votre streamer ou streameuse préférée.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je suis donc parti (grâce aux conseils de ma communauté) sur l&rsquo;option VLC qui permet de tout faire et surtout de lire une vidéo YouTube directement depuis le player comme ceci (je suis sous macOS, mais pour Windows ou Linux, c&rsquo;est le même principe) :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais, il y a une source VLC dans OBS, mais je n&rsquo;ai jamais réussi à la faire fonctionner correctement. Donc je suis parti sur VLC, mais chargé à l&rsquo;extérieur d&rsquo;OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sauf que je n’ai pas besoin de la vidéo, mais uniquement du son. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté ce paramètre :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' <strong>--no-video</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1656088500\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>À ce moment-là, le logiciel que j&rsquo;utilise pour ma table de mixage (<a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loopback</a>) n&rsquo;est pas encore compatible avec la dernière version de macOS. Je ne pouvais donc pas récupérer le son provenant de VLC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131001\" width=\"692\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-300x111.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-d61-768x284.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il fallait donc que je me débrouille sans ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai donc entrepris de créer toujours avec VLC, un streaming du live YouTube de Chillhop, qui serait accessible via l&rsquo;URL http://localhost:2323 que je pourrais alors charger dans une source « Media Source » dans OBS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ca donne donc ceci : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video <strong>--sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; comme dirait le chef Michel Dumas. Je peux alors créer ma nouvelle Media Source dans OBS et avoir le son de Chillhop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131002\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dfy-768x560.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais il y a deux problème à cette ligne de commande : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Il faut que je pense à la lancer avant de démarrer mon live. E</li><li>t quand je la lance, ça démarre VLC qui est alors visible comme ceci :</li></ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131003\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8-300x166.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dg8-768x424.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-2014473609\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_4' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_4\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos4' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos4\"></div></div><p>C&rsquo;est moche et si par réflexe, je ferme le terminal ou VLC, ça coupe la musique. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors pour masquer l&rsquo;interface de VLC, il suffit de le lancer avec ce paramètre : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <strong>-I http</strong> 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Impeccab&rsquo; again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toutefois, penser à le lancer à chaque fois, c&rsquo;est relou. C&rsquo;est là que j&rsquo;ai appris l&rsquo;existence des scripts dans OBS. En effet, on peut coder des scripts pour interagir avec OBS, soit en Python, soit en LUA. Je suis fan de Python donc je me dis que ça va être vite torché, mais malheureusement, j&rsquo;ai eu beau spécifier le bon interpréteur Python dans OBS, impossible de faire tourner le moindre script Python. Même un hello world ça ne fonctionnait pas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je ne pouvais pas non plus y passer des heures, donc je me suis rabattu sur le LUA. J&rsquo;ai donc pondu ce script en LUA pour appeler ma ligne de commande VLC. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est plusieurs centaines de lignes de code ultra complexes. Non, je déconne, c&rsquo;est juste une ligne de merde : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>-- Script LUA pour charger la musique de Chillhop dans OBS - https://korben.info\n\n<strong>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}'\")</strong></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>J&rsquo;ai sauvegardé ce script en le nommant chillhop.lua, puis je me suis rendu dans OBS, menu « Tools » &gt; « Scripts » et j&rsquo;ai simplement ajouté mon script Lua dedans :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131004\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-300x214.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221020-dli-768x548.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1293277903\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_5' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_5\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos5' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos5\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai relancé OBS et là, je me suis rendu compte que ça freezait tout mon OBS. En effet, en se chargeant, VLC bloque la suite du chargement de l&rsquo;application. J&rsquo;ai donc rajouté un petit &amp; à la fin de la commande pour que OBS reprenne immédiatement la main et n&rsquo;attende pas comme un con que VLC ait terminé.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>os.execute(\"/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I http 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NOSDKb0HlU' --no-video --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:2323}' <strong>&amp;</strong> \")</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ça fonctionne. OBS démarre, exécute le script LUA qui à son tour lance VLC en arrière plan pour lire la musique et OBS peut alors récupérer dans sa Media Source le son diffusé via l&rsquo;adresse localhost. C&rsquo;est transparent et rapide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui est cool avec tout ça, c&rsquo;est que ça ouvre un monde de possibilité pour augmenter et piloter OBS tout en script. C&rsquo;est donc à creuser. Il ne me manque plus que les bonnes idées maintenant.</p>\n",

Mais si c&rsquo;est le cas, c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il y a de nombreuses bonnes raisons de le faire. Régulièrement cités <strong>parmi les services VPN les plus&nbsp;fiables</strong>, ils sont aussi&nbsp;plutôt novateurs et proposent des options qui deviennent régulièrement des standards.&nbsp;L&rsquo;une des dernières en date étant <strong>l&rsquo;innovation Nexus</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusivité Surfshark, <strong>Nexus</strong> permet de connecter l&rsquo;ensemble du parc de serveurs (+ de 3200) en un seul réseau qui couvre quasiment la planète entière. Le premier bénéfice étant de rendre votre <strong>connexion plus stable et rapide</strong>. Finis d&rsquo;être connecté à un serveur unique dont les performances vont&nbsp;être dégradées s&rsquo;il est surchargé. Par effet cascade le second avantage est donc d&rsquo;améliorer&nbsp;votre confidentialité. Puisque les informations transitent via plusieurs serveurs, cela fragmente la&nbsp;surveillance possible et renforce donc votre protection. Cette nouveauté sera déployée totalement d&rsquo;ici fin 2023.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"418\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/gds-surfshark4\" alt=\"Surfshark Nexus\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>En attendant vous bénéficiez toujours des fonctionnalités déjà présentes :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>chiffrement de bout en bout (algo AES 256 GCM)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utilisation de protocoles sécurisés (WireGuard, IKv2/IPsec &#8230;)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>mode camouflage (cache à votre FAI que vous utilisez un VPN)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bouton kill switch (empêche vos données de fuiter lors d&rsquo;une déconnexion sauvage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>le split tunneling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>la protection lorsque vous vous connectez à un Wi-Fi public</li>\n\n\n\n<li>rotation d&rsquo;IP (sans déconnexion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>pas de conservations des logs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>blocage des pubs, cookies et autres malwares</li>\n\n\n\n<li></li>\n\n\n\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;autres nouveautés sont encore prévues dans les prochains mois, parce qu&rsquo;on peut toujours faire mieux. Comme par exemple la <strong>génération automatique d&rsquo;une nouvelle adresse IP</strong> pour chaque site que vous visitez (sans devoir déconnecter/reconnecter l&rsquo;outil).&nbsp;Si la&nbsp;<strong>fonction MultiHop</strong> est déjà disponible (elle permet de mettre un serveur supplémentaire entre vous et le&nbsp;site auquel vous vous connectez), elle&nbsp;disposera bientôt d&rsquo;une option pour l&rsquo;automatiser dans certains cas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"250\" height=\"141\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/krM6ANSNvFg52/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Exemple de MultiHop automatique</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous voulez tester le service pour pas cher ?

Pour 26 mois cela ne vous reviendra même pas à&nbsp;54€ au total, hors TVA, soit 84% de rabais. Ce qui fait toujours&nbsp;bien plaisir&nbsp;en pleine période d&rsquo;inflation. Un prix quasi&nbsp;imbattable pour un VPN de ce calibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes du genre à passer pas mal de commandes sur différents e-commerces, vous pourrez récupérer cette somme assez facilement. Comme vous le savez, les prix de certains produits, des billets d&rsquo;avions ou de trains, d&rsquo;un service de location &#8230; sont parfois dépendants de votre lieu de connexion. Avec Surfshark il suffit de tester depuis différents&nbsp;pays&nbsp;pour comparer les tarifs et prendre le plus intéressant pour vous. Et avec des serveurs dans plus de 100 localisations, il y a de quoi faire des tests et des comparaisons (sortez votre tableur Excel ;)).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l1IY5NRhxdCJYxsmA/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Vous pouvez même partager le prix de l&rsquo;abonnement&nbsp;avec plusieurs membres de la famille puisque le nombre d&rsquo;appareils supportés est illimité ! Votre enfant n&rsquo;a que 8 ans ? Pas d&rsquo;excuses, il faut lui apprendre les dures réalités économiques. S&rsquo;il veut continuer à regarder Adibou ou Pokémon, faut raquer ;p. Alors que d&rsquo;autres solutions vont (parfois) jusqu&rsquo;à 10 ou 12 appareils, Surfshark vous permet de protéger absolument tout et tout le monde. L&rsquo;ordinateur fixe,&nbsp;les 2 laptops, les 4 téléphones portables, la console de salon, le routeur&nbsp;et les équipements de la maison (Smart TV &amp; Co) &#8230; tout sera pris en charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et surtout, en plus d&rsquo;être très abordable, Surfshark est&nbsp;un VPN parmi les plus fiables actuellement sur le marché.

Dispo dans le jeu <a href=\"https://returntomonkeyisland.com/the-story-so-far\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mais aussi en ligne</a>, c&rsquo;est mignon, rigolo, et bien pensé !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce qui frappe en premier lieu, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;univers graphique, très différent de ce qu&rsquo;on a pu voir auparavant. Faut dire que chaque jeu propose un style artistique unique, et celui-ci ne fait pas exception à la règle. Mais lorsque le jeu fut annoncé et les premières images dévoilées, nombre de trolls se sont indignés (à tel point que Ron Gilbert a cessé toute communication). J&rsquo;étais sceptique mais une fois dans le jeu, franchement, à part quelques points particuliers, c&rsquo;est magnifique. Tout est très lisible, coloré, détaillé, super bien animé…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131344\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-4.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajoutez à cela un habillage sonore enchanteur avec d&rsquo;excellentes musiques, et on est embarqué direct dans l&rsquo;ambiance ! On retrouve le thème principal de la série, évidemment, mais pas que. 😉 Les arrangements sont super réussis, j&rsquo;ai adoré !</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1488330414\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Enfin bref, on est là pour vivre une aventure de pirates et résoudre plein d&rsquo;énigmes. Qu&rsquo;en est-il de ce côté là ? Eh bien, je suis désolé pour le manque de suspense mais c&rsquo;est encore une réussite. 🦜 L&rsquo;interface est bien foutue, accessible et ergonomique. Il y a un mode « facile » pour les personnes qui ne connaissent pas trop ce genre de jeu, c&rsquo;est une bonne idée mais attention, ça enlève certaines énigmes et donc certaines parties de l&rsquo;histoire. Je conseille de jouer en mode « difficile ».</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131341\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-2.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;histoire est vraiment très bien écrite, c&rsquo;est super drôle et prenant. Le rythme énigmes / dialogues / découverte de nouveaux lieux m&rsquo;a semblé équilibré, avec toujours une certaine liberté dans l&rsquo;ordre d&rsquo;appréhender les choses. On est jamais totalement coincé devant un truc sans savoir quoi faire, on peut toujours aller voir ailleurs et avancer d&rsquo;une manière ou d&rsquo;une autre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Au pire, y a un système d&rsquo;aide intégré au jeu, qui donne quelques indices sans jamais dévoiler la solution. Vraiment mieux que d&rsquo;aller chercher la <em>soluce</em> sur le web, c&rsquo;est bien dosé, vraiment nickel !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131342\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-768x432.webp 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/11/Return-to-Monkey-Island-3.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On sent l&rsquo;attention porté à chaque détail, et ce, sur chaque aspect. Les nouveaux venus sont accueillis aux petits soins, et les vieux de la vieille apprécieront les multiples références faites aux anciens jeux. Je pense que chacun peut y trouver son compte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non franchement j&rsquo;ai été conquis de bout en bout, pour les plus radins le jeu est actuellement disponible sur le Xbox Gamepass, mais vous pourrez aussi le trouver sur <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steam</a> (compatible Windows, Mac et Linux), <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/return-to-monkey-island-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/fr-fr/concept/10006133/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Playstation 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/fr-FR/games/store/return-to-monkey-island/9pc4r8n1n2t6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox Series X/S</a>&#8230; Pour moins de 25€ je ne peux que vous le conseiller !</p>\n",

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Les éditos sont faits pour ça 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-522601528\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>J&rsquo;ai bien sûr repris les <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/korbenfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch les lundi, mardi et jeudi après-midi</a> et je dois dire qu&rsquo;on rigole bien. Comme d&rsquo;hab, je papote avec les followers, j&rsquo;écris mes articles et je bidouille des trucs. Après si vous n&rsquo;êtes pas dispo à ces heures là, y&rsquo;a évidemment les replays. Côté TikTok, ça commence a devenir également sérieux puisque j&rsquo;ai atteint <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@korbeninfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">un nombre conséquent d&rsquo;abonnés</a>. Ça ne rigole plus 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D&rsquo;ailleurs demain même si c&rsquo;est férié, ça va être tournage de vidéos. C&rsquo;est amusant à faire, donc c&rsquo;est que du plaisir, je vous rassure 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà pour les news. L&rsquo;hiver est enfin là, donc le mood est au feu de cheminée, au chocolat chaud et bientôt à la raclette ^^. Noël arrive, faut bien commencer à se mettre dans l&rsquo;ambiance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon et vous ça va ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tchuss !</p>\n",

Mais est-ce la seule chose que vous pouvez faire ? Bien sûr que non. Et aujourd&rsquo;hui je vais vous proposer <strong>quelques actions quotidiennes</strong> que vous pouvez mettre en place pour vous protéger sur le long terme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avant de commencer, j&rsquo;insiste juste sur le fait que chaque jour lorsque vous surfez sur le web, que vous utilisez des applications, etc. vos données sont récupérées. C&rsquo;est comme ça. Et même par des services fiables cela peut créer des problèmes. Ils peuvent se faire hacker leur base de données, des employés peuvent les revendre en soum soum ou la société peut décider de faire un rab de&nbsp;moula en la revendant une fois qu&rsquo;elle a fermé ses portes. Bref tout atterrit <strong><a href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chez des data brokers qui collectent toutes ces infos</a></strong> et les revendent à prix d&rsquo;or. Parfois ces data brokers rachètent même des sites en perdition, juste pour disposer de la collecte de données qui a été réalisée (à des fins légitimes) pendant des années.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et même sans ça, vos données personnelles se retrouvent parfois disponibles en toute connaissance de cause. Par exemple sur des sites de fiches d&rsquo;entreprise lorsque vous créez une société, ou dans les fichiers PDF d&rsquo;un listing de diplômés d&rsquo;une école, de chercheurs dans une étude, etc.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"317\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/h55EUEsTG9224/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Bref nous sommes <strong>tous et toutes&nbsp;les vaches à lait de cette industrie</strong>. De manière directe&nbsp;ou au moins via les personnalités que nous nous créons en ligne (qui finissent par nous ressembler au final). Et s&rsquo;il est difficile de supprimer à 100% toutes nos traces numériques (surtout que la plupart du temps nous ne sommes même pas conscients d&rsquo;où elles circulent), il existe quelques possibilités pour limiter notre exposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1) Ne créez pas de compte si ce n&rsquo;est pas nécessaire</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon je sais, vous allez me dire que c&rsquo;est obvious. Je sais que ce n&rsquo;est pas votre cas, mes lecteurs adorés ont un QI supérieur à la moyenne. Mais qui ne connait pas une personne qui&nbsp;s&rsquo;ouvre un compte sur&nbsp;un e-commerce quelconque&nbsp;pour commander un objet pas cher et va ensuite laisser son compte existant pendant des années ? Peut-être qu&rsquo;en se demandant au départ si l&rsquo;objet en question est vraiment utile, le compte n&rsquo;aurait jamais eu besoin d&rsquo;être créé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"358\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPOqmCwBBEVPBOFYQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Est-ce qu&rsquo;ouvrir un 4e compte Instagram pour publier uniquement les photos&nbsp;de la tortue de compagnie&nbsp;est vraiment utile ? À vous de voir. Et si c&rsquo;est le cas, passez au point suivant lorsqu&rsquo;il ne vous est plus d&rsquo;aucune utilité. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dans le même esprit, ne donnez pas votre téléphone sans raison. Aussi bien dans les applis mobiles que dans les magasins physiques (si on vous les demande parfois ce n&rsquo;est que dans un seul but : vous balancer de la pub).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2) Fermer et supprimer vos comptes inutilisés</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Je sais que vous avez déjà pensé à ce point. Mais êtes-vous vraiment un bon élève ? Vous êtes certain qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas un petit compte non utilisé depuis 2 ans et que vous gardez parce que la flemme de retrouver le mot de passe ? Ou parce qu&rsquo;on ne sait jamais, vous pourriez en avoir besoin un jour ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La question de la vie privée était beaucoup moins présente il y a 10 ans. Combien ont toujours des infos (ne serait-ce que l&#8217;email) sur des sites abandonnés comme MySpace, Flickr, StumbleUpon ou que sais-je&nbsp;? À partir du moment où votre adresse mail est quelque part, elle pourra servir à des gens pour vous bombarder de spams (selon les estimations 97% des adresses mail en reçoivent).&nbsp;Pire, imaginez qu&rsquo;il y a&nbsp;10 ans vous aviez un Skyblog&nbsp;avec une photo gênante et que l&rsquo;on parvienne à recouper l&rsquo;info avec votre adresse mail toujours active aujourd&rsquo;hui ?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2Kgm3KOBUE6wF2/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est parfois bien caché dans les options, il faut parfois envoyer un mail personnalisé, etc., mais prenez le temps de le faire.&nbsp;Vous pouvez vous aider d&rsquo;un site comme <a href=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Just Delete Me</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combien recevez-vous de communications commerciales que vous ne lisez jamais ? Est-ce que toutes les newsletters que vous recevez sont vraiment importantes ? Etc. Je suis sûr qu&rsquo;il y a moyen de limiter ça.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3) Renforcez la&nbsp;vie privée sur les réseaux sociaux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Là encore ça semble logique, mais beaucoup ne prennent pas le temps d&rsquo;effectuer les quelques clics nécessaires. Surtout que les réseaux sont sans doute LA source de récolte numéro 1 à l&rsquo;heure actuelle. Lorsque vous partagez votre localisation, balancez une photo d&rsquo;un endroit que vous visitez, parlez sans arrêt avec une même personne, etc. il n&rsquo;est pas très compliqué pour les algorithmes de vite se faire une&nbsp;image assez précise de vous, de vos préférences&nbsp;et de qui sont vos proches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;autant plus le cas lorsque vous connectez les services entre-eux (en vous connectant à des sites tiers avec vos identifiants Google ou&nbsp;Facebook par exemple), là ce sont tous les&nbsp;services interconnectés&nbsp;qui peuvent accéder à vos données. Les réseaux sociaux tirent littéralement leurs bénéfices des publicités ciblées. Et pour en tirer le meilleur afin que leurs pubs soient les plus&nbsp;rentables possibles ? Il leur faut accéder au max de vos infos, bingo.&nbsp;Donc les paramètres de protections par défaut sont (trop) souvent&nbsp;permissifs.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"270\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/KPEpqHiJVrSVCOjyCP/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>À vous de limiter tout ça : ne pas laisser&nbsp;votre profil visible publiquement, retirer la géolocalisation,&nbsp;limiter qui a le droit de voir quoi, ne pas accepter la publicité ciblée, refuser les contenus supplémentaires, faire attention lorsque vous prenez des gens ou des lieux en photo, ne pas interconnecter les services, limiter au maximum les extensions, etc. Il y a quelques semaines&nbsp; je vous ai fait un petit guide&nbsp;pour <a href=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/comment-disparaitre-de-google.html\">disparaitre de Google</a>, ça pourrait vous servir.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ce n&rsquo;est pas non plus une mauvaise idée de supprimer vos anciens posts/tweets/photos, etc. s&rsquo;ils n&rsquo;ont plus rien à faire dans votre profil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4) Utilisez un navigateur web respectueux</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Désinstallez Google Chrome, Microsoft&nbsp;Edge, Apple Safari&nbsp;&amp; Co. Privilégiez Brave, Firefox ou Tor Browser qui sont les 3 navigateurs les plus sécurisés à ce niveau. Laissez-les faire le plus gros du travail de prévention, ils bloquent par défaut de nombreux traqueurs, les profils comportementaux, etc. Pour Tor il faut quand même mentionner que certains FAI (si pas tous) vont vous brider le débit dès qu&rsquo;ils se rendront compte que vous l&rsquo;utilisez. Mais, quel que soit celui que vous choisissez, continuer à limiter le nombre d&rsquo;extensions installées.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"324\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YsZBbMUeDLFNjQTtjz/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous voulez voir ce qui transparait avec votre navigateur actuel, il existe des sites <a href=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comme celui-ci</a>. Après sachez que même avec un bon navigateur, même avec un VPN, même avec Tor, etc. vous laisserez des bouts de&nbsp;traces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5) Retrouvez et faites supprimer vos infos chez les data brokers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant que vous avez limité au mieux la future&nbsp;récolte de vos données, comment faire pour celles qui trainent déjà sur la toile ? Il faudrait pouvoir retrouver tous les data brokers qui disposent de ces données, cela éviterait qu&rsquo;ils puissent continuer à les revendre. Si certains sont très connus (Spokeo, WhitePages &#8230;) pour d&rsquo;autres, il est très compliqué de remonter jusqu&rsquo;à eux. Si vous recevez un email de scam, un coup de fil marketing, etc. comment savoir d&rsquo;où ces gens ont&nbsp;obtenu vos infos ? Et lorsque vous avez fait ce travail digne de l&rsquo;inspecteur Derrick il faut encore obtenir du data broker qu&rsquo;il supprime ce qui doit l&rsquo;être. Multipliez cela par des dizaines de brokers et vous pouvez faire une croix sur vos soirées pour les 3 prochains mois.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>C&rsquo;est là qu&rsquo;intervient un service <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">comme Incogni</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"422\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/9u2-incogni1\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Il vont faire le gros du travail pour vous. Déjà en répertoriant chez quels data brokers vos données personnelles se retrouvent, ensuite en les contactant à votre place&nbsp;pour qu&rsquo;ils&nbsp;suppriment ces données&nbsp;et ensuite en faisant un suivit pour s&rsquo;assurer qu&rsquo;elles ne réapparaissent pas dans les prochaines années. Et si les brokers ne répondent pas aux demandes, Incogni va les relancer jusqu&rsquo;à ce que ce soit fait. Qu&rsquo;ils soient contactés par un service dont c&rsquo;est la spécialité ou par le mail dindon63@gmail.com de Mr Machin , ça risque de faire&nbsp;une différence 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous avez pas mal bourlingué sur le web depuis de nombreuses années et avec une identité&nbsp;figée (même adresse mail, même numéro de téléphone, mêmes services utilisés &#8230;), votre profil doit être assez précis et répandu. Pour moins de 6€/mois, la solution Incogni fera le nécessaire et vous tiendra au courant étape par étape via son tableau de bord. J&rsquo;ai d&rsquo;ailleurs <a href=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/incogni-test.html\">testé Incogni en détail</a> pour vous montrer comment cela se passe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"414\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/incogni-tableau-de-bord.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour résumer un peu tout ça, il faut avoir une bonne hygiène numérique au quotidien. Et lorsque les choses ont pris une certaine ampleur (ou que l&rsquo;on prend seulement conscience de l&rsquo;importance de faire respecter sa vie privée) il y a des services comme Incogni pour nous épauler. Bref nous ne sommes pas sans ressources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=959&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=inc\" target=\"_blank\">Découvrez Incogni !</a></h2>\n",

Et le fait de pouvoir intégrer ça dans vos scripts peut vous permettre d&rsquo;ajouter certaines fonctions sympas relatives à la compréhension / taggage d&rsquo;une image ou tout simplement à la génération d&rsquo;avatars ou d&rsquo;images diverses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">À découvrir ici.</a></p>\n",

Donc si vous avez un NAS par exemple, et bien vous ne pourrez pas le stocker chez eux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>À moins de prendre leur abonnement B2 qui offre un stockage pur et dur sans logiciel client.

Le concept est simple : pour avoir des sauvegardes efficaces et sérieuses, vous devez réaliser : </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 sauvegardes. 2 de ces sauvegardes sont stockées sur des supports différents (par exemple, un disque externe + un NAS) et la 3e sauvegarde doit être conservée hors site (donc pas chez vous). Cela peut être sur le cloud ou chez Tata Claude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée c&rsquo;est que si un incendie se déclare chez vous parce que vous avez chauffé votre maison avec vos meubles à cause de Bruno Lemaire, et bien même si toute votre famille a brulé, au moins, vous avez un backup de vos épisodes de Naruto.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130921\" width=\"494\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule.webp 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-300x122.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/3-2-1-Backup-Rule-768x312.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment pour gagner du temps, vous pouvez faire partir les 2 premiers backups (locaux) depuis votre ordinateur et le dernier off-site depuis votre NAS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuite pour revenir à Backblaze en cas de souci, vous pourrez alors récupérer vos données soit en les téléchargeant directement depuis leur site, soit en vous faisant livrer un disque dur contenant vos données.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alors, maintenant comment faire pour sauvegarder TOUT votre NAS vers Backblaze alors que les disques réseau ne sont pas supportés dans leur application cliente ?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1681548937\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Et bien c&rsquo;est simple, il faut gruger un peu et faire croire à l&rsquo;outil que les répertoires réseau que vous voulez envoyer là-bas sont des répertoires locaux. Et pour cela, 2 façons de faire en fonction de votre OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si vous êtes sous Windows, il vous faudra utiliser le logiciel libre <a href=\"http://dokan-dev.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dokany</a> qui permet de monter des systèmes de fichiers divers et variés (disque externe, disque réseau&#8230;etc.) pour les intégrer dans votre système de fichier actuel afin que toutes vos applications Windows puissent y accéder en toute transparence.

Et celui-ci est payant, car les gens qui utilisent des logiciels Apple ont de la grosse moula évidemment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il vous faudra donc vous offrir le logiciel <a href=\"https://automounter.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AutoMounter</a> pour la modique somme de 17 $ afin de monter vos disques distants un peu n&rsquo;importe où sur votre système macOS.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130923\" width=\"382\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg.webp 653w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221013-kkg-255x300.webp 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et voilà, ce n&rsquo;est pas plus compliqué que ça. Et évidemment, les sauvegardes se feront de manière fluide, avec le client Windows ou MacOS <a href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00wmi7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Backblaze</a> dans le cadre de votre forfait Personal Backup.</p>\n",

Mais voici quand même un exemple. Imaginons que dans votre dossier Downloads, vous ayez des tas de PDF que vous voulez déplacer dans un sous-dossier PDF ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lancez l&rsquo;édition de la config d&rsquo;Organize et scriptez comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># organize configuration file\n# https://organize.readthedocs.io\nrules:\n  - name: \"Find PDFs\"\n    locations:\n      - ~/Downloads\n    subfolders: true\n    filters:\n      - extension: pdf\n    actions:\n      - echo: \"Found PDF!\"\n      - move: ~/Downloads/PDFs/\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130867\" width=\"750\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7.webp 821w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-300x281.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221012-ct7-768x718.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Comme vous pouvez le voir, une règle se compose : </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>D&rsquo;un nom (name) (Vous mettre ce que vous voulez)</li><li>D&rsquo;un ou plusieurs emplacements (locations)</li><li>D&rsquo;actions (actions) pour afficher des messages ou agir sur les fichiers</li><li>Et d&rsquo;un tas d&rsquo;autres paramètres comme le parcours des sous dossiers, le filtrage des fichiers par extension&#8230;etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1876307667\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_3' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_3\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos3\"></div></div><p>Cet exemple n&rsquo;est pas exhaustif. Il est par exemple possible de désactiver une règle en passant à « false » le paramètre « enabled ». Les filtres sont également intéressant car ils permettent de débusquer les fichiers selon la structure de leur nom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il y a vraiment beaucoup de paramètres qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans chacune de vos règles donc je vous invite encore une fois à vous pencher sur la doc. Si par malheur, Organize rencontre des conflits de fichiers, l&rsquo;outil dispose également d&rsquo;options pour résoudre cela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les données Exif peuvent également être extraites des fichiers pour ensuite être utilisées à votre convenance et l&rsquo;outil est capable d&rsquo;extraire du contenu de PDFs ou de fichiers DOCX&#8230;etc our mieux les catégoriser. C&rsquo;est hyper puissant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Un mode « simulation » permet également de tester vos règles sans risque afin d&rsquo;éviter de massacrer vos fichiers en cas d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un outil formidable qui en fait beaucoup. L&rsquo;essayer c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;adopter !</p>\n",

Très logiquement ces « soldes » avant l&rsquo;heure&nbsp;se sont propagées au web et&nbsp;sont souvent l&rsquo;occasion pour les boites Tech de proposer des tarifs intéressants, avec en tête de liste les VPNs. <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Cette année la promo Black Friday de Surfshark a lieu du 27 octobre au 27 novembre 2022</strong>.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/4kn-blackfriday-surfshark\" alt=\"Interface Surfshark\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a>, partenaire de longue date de korben.info (merci à eux !), ne déroge pas à la règle et vous propose chaque année des prix vraiment bluffants et qui valent le détour.&nbsp;Cette année par exemple vous pourrez bénéficier d&rsquo;un <strong>tarif de 2.05 $ par mois</strong> (soit environ 2.05 €) <strong><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sur un abonnement de 2 ans</a></strong> (24 mois) avec 2 mois offerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je n&rsquo;ai aucun mal à vous recommander Surfshark en tant que solution VPN à utiliser. Pas parce qu&rsquo;ils sont partenaires, mais parce que la boite est l&rsquo;une des plus sérieuses depuis son lancement en 2018. Et ne prenez pas mon avis comme argent comptant, je ne suis pas le seul à le dire. Encore dernièrement ils ont par exemple été récompensés&nbsp;lors de la <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://cybersecuritybreakthrough.com/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://cybersecuritybreakthrough.com/\" target=\"_blank\">6e CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards</a> grâce à leur solution <a href=\"https://surfshark.com/fr/surfshark-nexus-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nexus</a>, reconnue comme étant la meilleure solution VPN du marché.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark Black Friday 2022\" class=\"wp-image-131111\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/surfshark-bf-2022-300x91.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Toute la boite à outils pour protéger votre vie privée en ligne est bien entendu toujours présente.

Cela inclus de :&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cacher&nbsp;votre adresse IP</a> (+ rotation régulière)</li><li>ne pas conserver&nbsp;de traces de votre activité en ligne</li><li>contourner la censure et les contenus géolimités</li><li>chiffrer vos informations de bout en bout (algo AES-256-GCM)</li><li>protection de votre identité</li><li>bloquer les publicités, cookies &amp; co</li><li>se protéger des logiciels malveillants</li><li>protéger vos connexions sur les Wi-Fi publics</li><li>fonctionnalité Bypasser (leur fonction de&nbsp;split tunneling)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Toutes les fonctionnalités classiques sont de la partie. Et parmi les dernières nouveautés&nbsp;du service, on note qu&rsquo;ils ont dorénavant&nbsp;un parc de plus de 3200&nbsp;serveurs <strong>répartis dans plus de 100 pays différents</strong> ! Les nouveaux pays sont le Ghana, l&rsquo;Arabie Saoudite et Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;interface pour Linux (souvent le parent pauvre des OS) a récemment été retravaillée pour&nbsp;plus de lisibilité&nbsp;et voit l&rsquo;ajout d&rsquo;un bouton Kill Switch plutôt pratique. <strong>Le mode camouflage</strong> est, lui aussi, toujours de la partie. Pour rappel c&rsquo;est un mode assez sympa qui permet de cacher même à votre fournisseur d&rsquo;accès Internet que vous utiliser un VPN.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg\" alt=\"Surfshark dans 100 pays\" class=\"wp-image-131115\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark.jpg 750w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/100-pays-serveurs-surfshark-300x147.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption><em>source : blog Surfshark</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cerise sur la tarte le nombre d&rsquo;appareils qui peuvent être connectés sur un compte est &#8230; illimité.&nbsp;Ordinateur fixe/portable, téléphones perso et pro, téléviseur intelligent,&nbsp;Google Home ou Alexa, routeur&nbsp;&#8230; tout est couvert ! Que ces appareils tournent sur Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, s&rsquo;utilisent via un navigateur web&nbsp;ou via une console (Xbox ou PlayStation) n&rsquo;est pas un souci.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mais si vous voulez jeter un oeil du côté des options payantes (et facultatives) il y a aussi de quoi faire. Un moteur de recherche (<em>Surfshark Search</em>)&nbsp;qui vous permet d&rsquo;obtenir des résultats non traqués et impartiaux (pas des résultats faussés par votre historique et vos recherches précédentes). Un système de surveillance (<em>Surfshark Alerts</em>)&nbsp;qui permet&nbsp;d&rsquo;être alerté si certaines de vos informations personnelles sont divulguées. Ou encore un antivirus (plus de détails dans mon article <a href=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://korben.info/surfshark-antivirus.html\">Antivirus Surfshark</a>). Le pack des 3 est dispo pour 1.5€/mois.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=87&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixedBTS\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-131122\" width=\"658\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-300x300.png 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-150x150.png 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1-768x768.png 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/1080x1080-1.png 1081w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Bon à savoir</em> : le prix affiché est de 2.22 $ (ou 2.25 €), mais au paiement ce sera ramené vers le bas&nbsp;autour de&nbsp;2.05 € (selon le taux de change du jour, pas merci à l&rsquo;€ de se faire défoncer depuis quelques mois).

Si vous utilisez déjà Surfshark pour surfer, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien de plus à installer pour profiter de l&rsquo;antivirus. Celui-ci est intégré au logiciel et ça permet d&rsquo;alléger votre machine en ayant un seul outil qui fait tout.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/l4w-surfshark-antivirus\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Disponible sous Windows, macOS et Android, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark est vraiment très facile à utiliser</a>. Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les captures écran, l&rsquo;interface est plutôt limpide et épurée à destination des débutants et des gens qui ne veulent plus se prendre la tête avec un antivirus lourdingue. Au contraire, Surfshark a mis un point d&rsquo;honneur à rendre son antivirus très léger aussi bien pour votre RAM que pour votre processeur même lors des scans approfondis.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130679\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5t-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Au niveau des fonctionnalités, l&rsquo;antivirus propose tout le nécessaire que nous sommes en droit d&rsquo;attendre d&rsquo;un antivirus. Tout d&rsquo;abord, il est possible de lancer des analyses manuelles de vos disques dès que vous en ressentez le besoin. Mais le mieux c&rsquo;est encore de programmer tout cela, avec des analyses régulières (par exemple 1 fois par semaine), ce qui permet de tout simplement l&rsquo;oublier tout en restant protégé.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130680\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5j-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Évidemment, il sécurise et surveille votre ordinateur avec une surveillance en temps réel, là où d&rsquo;autres antivirus (gratuits la plupart du temps) se contentent d&rsquo;un scan passif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et si vous téléchargez un fichier sur lequel vous avez un doute, vous pouvez également le glisser-déposer sur l&rsquo;outil pour que celui-ci analyse son contenu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concernant le moteur de l&rsquo;antivirus, ce dernier repose sur le célèbre Avira et peut prévenir les attaques de type Zéro Day (exploitant des failles nouvelles non corrigées) grâce au système <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Surfshark Cloud Protect</a> qui mutualise toutes les détections de virus à l&rsquo;échelle de tous leurs clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"817\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130681\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2.webp 817w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-300x219.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221005-l5z-2-768x561.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Alors bien sûr, c&rsquo;est un antivirus encore jeune, mais solide puisqu&rsquo;il repose sur un moteur déjà bien éprouvé. De plus, Surfshark est connu pour fournir un service de qualité, que ce soit pour son VPN ou les autres produits de la gamme Surfshark One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;avantage avec l&rsquo;antivirus Surfshark, c&rsquo;est que si vous utilisez déjà leur VPN, vous n&rsquo;aurez rien à installer de plus (il faut juste prendre l&rsquo;abonnement Surfshark One). Et si vous hésitiez à choisir un VPN ou un Antivirus, grâce à l&rsquo;offre de Surfshark, vous pourrez combiner les deux sans alourdir votre machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1066&amp;aff_id=13768&amp;source=fixed-av1\" target=\"_blank\">Je vous invite à en découvrir plus en cliquant ici.</a></p>\n",

Slick Inbox reçoit alors les missives électroniques pour les centraliser dans son application !</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221006-m1g.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130710\" width=\"542\" height=\"548\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Et si vous ne connaissez pas de bonnes newsletters auxquelles vous abonner, ne vous inquiétez pas puisque Slick Inbox propose un kiosque avec des tonnes de newsletters classées par catégories : Design, Marketing, Développement Personnel, Technologie, Jeux Vidéos, Musique, Développement, Finance et j&rsquo;en passe&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi l&rsquo;application vous permet également de recevoir des motifs, de mettre en favori certaines newsletters, mais également d&rsquo;archiver ce que vous voulez&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bref, un nouveau moyen bien pratique pour conjuguer ce moyen de communication archaïque qu&rsquo;est la newsletter avec nos vies trépidantes d&rsquo;hommes et de femmes modernes qui n&rsquo;ont pas de temps à perdre avec leur boite mail (genre moi).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ps : Je crois également que <a href=\"https://korben.info/feedly.html\"><strong>Feedly</strong></a> fait ça aussi.</p>\n",

Mais la vérité est ailleurs surtout pour les développeurs qui savent que le monde se divise en réalité entre le Frontend et le Backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Et pour que ces 2 faces d&rsquo;une même pièce puissent « discuter », il nous faut des API. API, ça veut dire Application Programming Interface et c&rsquo;est tout simplement un ensemble d&rsquo;instructions permettant aux applications de communiquer entre elles. Maintenant des types d&rsquo;API, il y en a des tonnes, mais je vous propose qu&rsquo;aujourd&rsquo;hui on s&rsquo;intéresse aux API qui respectent le standard architectural REST. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>En effet, quand on travaille en tant que développeur, on ne peut pas passer à côté des API REST, tant cette pratique est très répandue. Si vous débutez dans votre métier, c&rsquo;est forcement quelque chose que vous devez apprendre et maitriser. De la même manière, quand on débute sa carrière de développeur ou qu&rsquo;on a déjà beaucoup d&rsquo;années au compteur mais qu&rsquo;on ne connaît pas sa valeur sur le marché de l&#8217;emploi, il est bon de connaître la grille des salaires en France. Ça tombe bien puisque&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talent.io a mis en ligne une étude des salaires de la tech en 2022</a></strong>&nbsp;pour que vous puissiez déterminer si votre salaire est correct ou sous évalué.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vous invite à vous plonger dedans afin de savoir où vous vous situez sur cette grille des salaires.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\"><img src=\"https://me.korben.info/w96-talent-bun\" alt=\"\" width=\"733\" height=\"484\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>C&rsquo;est quoi une API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>REST, ça veut dire « Representational State Transfer ». Lorsqu&rsquo;une API respecte les contraintes de REST, on parle alors d&rsquo;une API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quand un développeur veut créer une API RESTful, il doit alors respecter les contraintes édictées par REST, notamment sur le fait que son API doit fonctionner au travers du protocole HTTP et de ses verbes (GET, POST&#8230;etc.) et que les requêtes et les réponses de l&rsquo;API soient dans un format texte tels que JSON, HTML, XML&#8230;etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les API RESTful sont alors mises à disposition des applications via ce qu&rsquo;on appelle des endpoints. Un endpoint est un assemblage de 2 choses : une URI et un verbe HTTP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admettons que j&rsquo;ai une API qui permette de lister des utilisateurs, mais également d&rsquo;en créer des nouveaux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;URI de mon API est la suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:&#47;&#47;url.com/api/user</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le but du jeu, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;appeler par exemple ce endpoint avec le verbe GET pour obtenir une liste de tous les utilisateurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>GET: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ou pour ajouter un nouvel utilisateur, on peut utiliser le verbe POST comme ceci, en transmettant un bout de JSON contenant toutes les informations liées à l&rsquo;utilisateur qu&rsquo;on souhaite créer (nom, prénom&#8230;etc.) : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>POST: /user/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>L&rsquo;idée là, c&rsquo;est de vous montrer qu&rsquo;on peut interagir avec l&rsquo;API à l&rsquo;aide de différents verbes HTTP. Get peut être assimilé au verbe « lire », POST au verbe « créer », PUT et PATCH au verbe « Mettre à jour » et DELETE au verbe « supprimer ». C&rsquo;est aussi simple que cela. Et en retour le serveur peut alors répondre avec des codes de status HTTP classiques comme 200, 201, 2002&#8230;etc. pour dire que tout est OK, ou des codes de redirection 3xx, d&rsquo;erreur client 4xx ou d&rsquo;erreur serveur 5xx.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ce qui concerne le format utilisé par les requêtes et les réponses, vous pouvez utiliser du texte, peu importe son format (html, xml.etc.), mais par convention, on utilise surtout du JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Et JSON ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON a la particularité d&rsquo;être facile à lire et à écrire pour les humains et est utilisé pour enregistrer des données dans des bases de données, mais également pour transmettre ces données entre les applications. C&rsquo;est pourquoi on l&rsquo;utilise dans les API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le JSON est une collection de paires nom / valeur qui sont ordonnées dans une liste. Ainsi les valeurs contenues dans le JSON peuvent être une chaine de caractère (string), un nombre, mais également des objets JSON, des tableaux de valeurs (Array), des booléens (true / false) ou la fameuse valeur null.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà concernant les grands principes des API RESTful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comment créer votre première API RESTful ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant je vous propose qu&rsquo;on apprenne à en créer une de zéro. Vous allez voir, c&rsquo;est super simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour cette démo, j&rsquo;ai choisi d&rsquo;utiliser Python comme d&rsquo;habitude. Et je vais importer dans mon code le framework <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flask</a> qui va me permettre de faire monter mon API RESTful très facilement. Installez Flask comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pip3 install flask-restful</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour tester l&rsquo;API, nous allons utiliser un outil qui permet à la fois de balancer nos requêtes et de voir si les réponses correspondent bien. L&rsquo;un des plus connus s&rsquo;appelle Postman et c&rsquo;est gratuit en version de base pour tester. L&rsquo;application Desktop de Postman <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">est disponible ici</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://me.korben.info/3y1-talent-API-REST\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ensuite, nous allons définir ce que va faire notre API. Ce sera quelque chose d&rsquo;assez simple permettant de créer, supprimer, lire et mettre à jour des données. Admettons que j&rsquo;ai un site sur lequel je dois référencer des produits. Chacun de ces produits aura un id, un nom, un prix et une catégorie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le code de votre première API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Je vais donc créer un fichier productAPI.py et je vais importer Flask comme ceci avec ses imports spécifiques aux API et au parsing JSON :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>from flask import Flask\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api, reqparse\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Puis je vais créer une espèce de mini base de données JSON directement dans mon code afin d&rsquo;y référencer mes produits :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>products = &#91;\n    { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Stylo 4 couleurs\", \"price\": 10, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Cahier vert\", \"price\": 20, \"category\": \"Papeterie\" },\n    { \"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Télévision 4K\", \"price\": 30, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Souris sans fil\", \"price\": 40, \"category\": \"Tech\" },\n    { \"id\": 5, \"name\": \"Ananas\", \"price\": 50, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 6, \"name\": \"Kinder Bueno\", \"price\": 60, \"category\": \"Alimentaire\" },\n    { \"id\": 7, \"name\": \"Chemise de président\", \"price\": 70, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 8, \"name\": \"T-shirt de punk\", \"price\": 80, \"category\": \"Textile\" },\n    { \"id\": 9, \"name\": \"Tournevis bleu\", \"price\": 90, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" },\n    { \"id\": 10, \"name\": \"Marteau rouge\", \"price\": 100, \"category\": \"Bricolage\" }\n    ]</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintenant on va créer une classe Product qui sera vu comme un endpoint au niveau de notre API. Et dans cette class, nous allons placer nos 4 fonctions correspondantes aux 4 verbes HTTP dont je vous ai parlé plus haut.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>class Product(Resource):\n\n    def get(self, id):\n\n    def post(self, id):\n\n    def put(self, id):\n\n    def delete(self, id):</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La structure de base de notre API est OK. Maintenant, on va définir chacune de ces fonctions en commençant par la fonction get utilisée pour récupérer les informations d&rsquo;un produit à partir de son ID. Comme vous pouvez le voir, on fait une boucle « for » qui va parcourir l&rsquo;ensemble des produits et si l&rsquo;ID correspond à ce qui spécifié dans la requête, on renvoie l&rsquo;objet « product » avec son code HTTP 200 et si ce n&rsquo;est pas le cas, on renvoie un message « Produit introuvable » accompagné d&rsquo;un code d&rsquo;erreur HTTP 404 qui correspond à une ressource non trouvée.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return product, 200\n        return \"Produit introuvable\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction suivante va nous permettre de créer un nouveau produit. La donnée utilisée dans la requête étant structurée en JSON, cette fonction va utiliser le parseur de Flask pour extraire toutes les données du JSON et les ajouter à notre tableau de produits : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def post(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                return \"Ce produit {} existe deja\".format(id), 400\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois que le produit est créé, on retourne le code 201 qui veut dire que la création s&rsquo;est bien déroulée. Et si le produit existait déjà avec cet ID, on renvoie le code 400 avec un message d&rsquo;erreur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La fonction put suivante est assez similaire puisqu&rsquo;elle permet à la fois de créer un nouveau produit (si l&rsquo;id n&rsquo;est pas encore utilisé) ou de mettre à jour un produit existant.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def put(self, id):\n        parser = reqparse.RequestParser()\n        parser.add_argument(\"name\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"price\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"category\")\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n\n        for product in products:\n            if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                product&#91;\"name\"] = args&#91;\"name\"]\n                product&#91;\"price\"] = args&#91;\"price\"]\n                product&#91;\"category\"] = args&#91;\"category\"]\n                return product, 200\n\n        product = {\n            \"id\": id,\n            \"name\": args&#91;\"name\"],\n            \"price\": args&#91;\"price\"],\n            \"category\": args&#91;\"category\"]\n        }\n        products.append(product)\n        return product, 201</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, la fonction delete permettra de supprimer un enregistrement à partir de son ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def delete(self, id):\n        global products\n        products = &#91;product for product in products if product&#91;\"id\"] != id]\n        return \"{} is deleted.\".format(id), 200</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Une fois ces fonctions définies, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à spécifier le format de l&rsquo;URI qui sera utilisé pour appeler l&rsquo;API et lancer l&rsquo;API (en mode debug pour démarrer). Le paramètre &lt;int:id&gt; permet d&rsquo;indiquer que dans le chemin du endpoint, on peut ajouter une variable acceptée par l&rsquo;API (ici l&rsquo;ID du produit).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>api.add_resource(Product, \"/product/&lt;int:id&gt;\")\napp.run(debug=True)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tester l&rsquo;API avec Postman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enfin, il ne reste plus qu&rsquo;à lancer le script python à l&rsquo;aide de la commande suivante : </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>python3 productAPI.py</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Le serveur web de Flask se lancera alors et vous verrez apparaitre une URL locale que vous pourrez appeler dans Postman pour ensuite tester votre API.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

produit (grâce à son ID) : </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

qu&rsquo;on souhaite transmettre un contenu de type « RAW » au format JSON et appeler le endpoint avec l&rsquo;ID de notre nouveau produit (ce n&rsquo;est pas l&rsquo;idéal bien sûr, car le principe d&rsquo;un nouvel ID c&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;il soit généré directement par le code de l&rsquo;API, mais c&rsquo;est pour illustrer mon exemple).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure

/></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Et ensuite ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vous l&rsquo;aurez compris, ce n&rsquo;est vraiment pas compliqué à développer. Ici on est sur un exemple simple, mais ensuite, vous devrez pourquoi pas sortir vos données d&rsquo;une base de données, penser à correctement gérer les erreurs et faire preuve de rigueur dans la structure de vos endpoints. Par exemple, dans mon endpoint, l&rsquo;URI est xxxx/product/. J&rsquo;aurais pu faire mieux en respectant la convention et en mettant/products/ au pluriel. Car en cas de GET, je peux aussi demander à récupérer l&rsquo;ensemble des produits existants. Dans ce cas, je dois modifier ma fonction GET comme ceci :</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>    def get(self, id):\n        if (id == 0):\n            return products, 200\n        else:\n            for product in products:\n                if (id == product&#91;\"id\"]):\n                    return product, 200\n            return \"Product not found\", 404</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsi, en passant l&rsquo;id 0 lors de mon GET, je récupérerai alors tous les produits.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"687\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130939\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99.webp 687w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/SCR-20221014-m99-268x300.webp 268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>N&rsquo;oubliez pas également de documenter l&rsquo;ensemble de votre API afin de vous y retrouver et surtout d&rsquo;indiquer à d&rsquo;autres développeurs, comment l&rsquo;intégrer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voilà, j&rsquo;espère que cette petite initiation et explications aux API RESTful vous aura intéressé et donné envie de vous y mettre plus sérieusement. Peut-être changer un peu votre façon de coder, voire carrément changer de job pour trouver une équipe plus agile et plus au fait des pratiques de dev modernes. Et pourquoi pas en profiter pour continuer à évoluer dans les technologies, ou obtenir un meilleur salaire. C’est une démarche qui peut s’avérer assez compliquée, stressante parfois, tant on a envie de trouver un travail qui nous corresponde. On peut souhaiter avoir un travail plus proche de chez soi voire en télétravail complet, un meilleur salaire, une meilleure ambiance au travail, ou même tout ça à la fois (mais ce n’est pas forcément facile à trouver).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heureusement, talent.io est là pour vous aider. Il vous suffit de&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-fr?utm_source=korben&amp;utm_medium=partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Q4&amp;utm_content=article1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">créer un compte sur la plateforme talent.io</a></strong>&nbsp;en quelques clics pour ensuite recevoir des offres de la part d’entreprises qui correspondent à vos critères précis et qui affichent un salaire d’entrée de jeu. talent.io est vraiment le moyen le plus simple de trouver son prochain job tech, d’ailleurs les inscrits trouvent leur emploi en 20 jours en moyenne.</p>\n",

Ce site vous permet de construire des « prompts », c&rsquo;est-à-dire des phrases à destination d&rsquo;outils comme Midjourney ou encore Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le principe est simple. Vous lui passez des URLs d&rsquo;images dont vous aimez le style, vous agrémentez tout cela de mots clés que vous pouvez pondérer puis vous pouvez choisir <a href=\"https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">des tas de paramètres et de styles</a> proposés et supportés par votre générateur (au hasard Midjourney) afin d&rsquo;obtenir le résultat de vos rêves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Après moultes essais et inspiration prise dans la galerie de Midjourney et à l&rsquo;aide de DoctorMars (fidèle de Korben.info), j&rsquo;ai réussi à passer de ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130559\" width=\"493\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-300x79.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik1-768x203.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-779997892\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>À ça :</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130560\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2.webp 1000w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-300x300.webp 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-150x150.webp 150w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/09/vik2-768x768.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ce que je peux vous dire, c&rsquo;est que ce n&rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&rsquo;il y parait.

On s&rsquo;affronte par équipe de 4 en balançant de l&rsquo;encre partout ; et c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;équipe qui aura colorié le plus de territoire de sa propre couleur qui gagne la partie. C&rsquo;est ici que le jeu se démarque, car même si vous ne savez pas très bien viser, vous pouvez être utile à votre équipe. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Splatoon 3 – Maintenant disponible !

On peut facilement varier les plaisirs !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Les modes de jeu, eux aussi, sont variés. Entre les matchs classiques, les parties « ranked » (matchs « anarchie » avec différentes règles du jeu possible !), ou bien en coopératif… Il y a de quoi faire ! On a même un jeu de carte assez cool, où l&rsquo;on construit son propre deck. 🤓</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130718\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-300x168.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02-768x431.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/Splatoon3_Overview_MoreWays_Tableturf_Scr_02.jpg 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le mode solo n&rsquo;est pas en reste, il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un tutorial géant mais vraiment sympa, où l&rsquo;on alterne entre phases d&rsquo;exploration et épreuves, nous faisant découvrir un large éventail d&rsquo;armes et de techniques. Bref, au niveau du contenu, c&rsquo;est vraiment généreux, sans même parler des cosmétiques, rangs et armes à débloquer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1910884207\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Techniquement, hormis la Cité-clabousse qui rame (allez savoir pourquoi), le jeu est ultra bien foutu : c&rsquo;est beau, lisible, super fluide ! La plate-forme réseau manque encore un peu de stabilité, mais elle est toute récente et s&rsquo;améliore continuellement, donc sur le moyen/long terme ça devrait le faire. Enfin j&rsquo;espère. 🤞</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130719\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_03.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Les menus ne sont pas d&rsquo;une ergonomie sans faille, ils ont voulu faire un truc classe avec un hub, des boutiques, etc. C&rsquo;est joli mais au final on se perd un peu, on perd du temps, et pire, on passe à côté de certaines options (perso j&rsquo;ai mis un temps fou à comprendre comment jouer à Cartes &amp; Territoire, ou comment modifier la skin de mon inkling)… C&rsquo;est un peu dommage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ceci étant dit, c&rsquo;est toujours mieux que dans Splatoon 2 ! 😁 Il y a de nettes améliorations, par exemple, on peut zapper l&rsquo;introduction de chaque nouvelle rotation de maps. Y a eu de vrais efforts pour rendre l&rsquo;expérience plus agréable. Quelques autres apports, en vrac :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Un meilleur lobby (avec entrainement pendant l&rsquo;attente, etc.)</li><li>De nouveaux mouvements pour nos calamars</li><li>Un casier à décorer avec des stickers</li><li>Nouvelles armes, maps, cosmétiques…</li><li>Les matchs à 3 équipes !</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130720\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitch_Splatoon3_05.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Concrètement, ce n&rsquo;est pas une suite révolutionnaire, mais elle améliore et apporte plein de petites choses. Au final, quand on met tout bout à bout, ça fait une grosse différence. Si vous aimez les shooters, c&rsquo;est super original et surtout : très fun !</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3e9cJAw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Acheter Splatoon 3 sur Nintendo Switch</a></h2>\n",

C&rsquo;est à dire qu&rsquo;on fait la course, mais en se goinfrant le plus possible sur le chemin : car c&rsquo;est la personne qui aura dévoré le plus de sucreries à la fin des 4 manches qui aura gagné. 😋 Deux manches sur circuits (à la manière d&rsquo;un Mario Kart en plus léger), et deux manches en arène (où on ramasse un max de gourmandises en essayant de faire tomber les autres pour piquer les leurs) : à la fin on pèse les Kirbys et que le plus lourd gagne !</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130668\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_2_4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Le gameplay se résume à l&rsquo;essentiel : déplacement, saut, attaque spéciale (grâce aux bonus récupérés ici et là). Il y a juste la gestion de l&rsquo;inertie, propre à la petite boule qu&rsquo;on dirige, qui va demander quelques petites minutes d&rsquo;adaptation : le concept est aussi simple que la prise en main est immédiate, c&rsquo;est un party-game d&rsquo;une efficacité assez redoutable. Et tellement mignon&#8230; 🥰</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niveau contenu, en terme de modes de jeux ou nombre de circuits/niveaux, là aussi on se contente de l&rsquo;essentiel. Pas de quoi être déçu, car c&rsquo;est cohérent avec le prix affiché (15€). Pour les fous furieux, sachez qu&rsquo;il y a des tonnes de petits cosmétiques et autres à débloquer. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-130669\" srcset=\"https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://korben.info/app/uploads/2022/10/NSwitchDS_KirbysDreamBuffet_3_1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; \" id=\"NKSYD1CP-1146385180\"><div id='optidigital-adslot-Content_2' style='display:none;' class=\"Content_2\"></div>\r\n<div id='optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2' style='display:none;' class=\"Mobile_Pos2\"></div></div><p>Jouable à 4 en ligne ou en local (chacun sa console), mais pas en écran splitté sur la même console : là on est limités à 2 joueurs.

Donc du matos réellement testé sur lequel chacun vient donner son avis. À vous ensuite de faire le tri en fonction de ce qui vous intéresse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Est-ce le prix, la note du benchmark, la capacité, la vitesse ou la note globale ?
