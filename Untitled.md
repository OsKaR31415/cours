Hello,

I found your website, it's a very cool one, definitely sharing it !
I stumbled upon your "Ian's fast knot", very good one !
But I suspect a "double discovery" as they happend often. Indeed, this exact knot has been used as a magic trick : doing a knot without the tips of the rope. There is also an end you can do, where you put the tips through the loops in a weird way, and end up with a "jammed knot", but that actually isn't really jammed (a "false knot").
It's a bit hard to search for the history of an art that is a bit secret by nature, and where we don't give names to everything, so no idea of which one prevails in time.
Thought you may be interested
