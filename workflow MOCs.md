How I create my [[Map of content|Maps Of Content]]
## Textual MOCs
 - For **small** MOCs
     - Simply use The dataview query
 - For big MOCs
     - Build sections by big themes, make nested lists
     - use the dataview queries to make sure everything is here
         - Put dataview queries for each section

## Drawed MOCs
Not implemented yet

> [!note] Ideas
>  - with excalidraw
>  - only for very general things (big Themes)
>  - ==Make it The Map of MOCs==
